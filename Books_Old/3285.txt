Thus, he\r\nwho has travelled far and seen much is apt to fancy that he has lived\r\nlong; and the history that most abounds in important incidents soonest\r\nassumes the aspect of antiquity. In no other way can we account for the\r\nvenerable air that is already gathering around American annals. When the\r\nmind reverts to the earliest days of colonial history, the period seems\r\nremote and obscure, the thousand changes that thicken along the links\r\nof recollections, throwing back the origin of the nation to a day so\r\ndistant as seemingly to reach the mists of time; and yet four lives of\r\nordinary duration would suffice to transmit, from mouth to mouth, in the\r\nform of tradition, all that civilized man has achieved within the\r\nlimits of the republic. Although New York alone possesses a population\r\nmaterially exceeding that of either of the four smallest kingdoms of\r\nEurope, or materially exceeding that of the entire Swiss Confederation,\r\nit is little more than two centuries since the Dutch commenced their\r\nsettlement, rescuing the region from the savage state. Thus, what seems\r\nvenerable by an accumulation of changes is reduced to familiarity when\r\nwe come seriously to consider it solely in connection with time.\r\n\r\nThis glance into the perspective of the past will prepare the reader to\r\nlook at the pictures we are about to sketch, with less surprise than he\r\nmight otherwise feel; and a few additional explanations may carry him\r\nback in imagination to the precise condition of society that we desire\r\nto delineate. It is matter of history that the settlements on the\r\neastern shores of the Hudson, such as Claverack, Kinderhook, and even\r\nPoughkeepsie, were not regarded as safe from Indian incursions a century\r\nsince; and there is still standing on the banks of the same river, and\r\nwithin musket-shot of the wharves of Albany, a residence of a younger\r\nbranch of the Van Rensselaers, that has loopholes constructed for\r\ndefence against the same crafty enemy, although it dates from a period\r\nscarcely so distant. Other similar memorials of the infancy of the\r\ncountry are to be found, scattered through what is now deemed the very\r\ncentre of American civilization, affording the plainest proofs that all\r\nwe possess of security from invasion and hostile violence is the growth\r\nof but little more than the time that is frequently fulfilled by a\r\nsingle human life.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of this tale occurred between the years 1740 and 1745,\r\nwhen the settled portions of the colony of New York were confined to\r\nthe four Atlantic counties, a narrow belt of country on each side of the\r\nHudson, extending from its mouth to the falls near its head, and to\r\na few advanced "neighborhoods" on the Mohawk and the Schoharie. Broad\r\nbelts of the virgin wilderness not only reached the shores of the first\r\nriver, but they even crossed it, stretching away into New England, and\r\naffording forest covers to the noiseless moccasin of the native warrior,\r\nas he trod the secret and bloody war-path. A bird\'s-eye view of the\r\nwhole region east of the Mississippi must then have offered one\r\nvast expanse of woods, relieved by a comparatively narrow fringe of\r\ncultivation along the sea, dotted by the glittering surfaces of lakes,\r\nand intersected by the waving lines of river. In such a vast picture of\r\nsolemn solitude, the district of country we design to paint sinks into\r\ninsignificance, though we feel encouraged to proceed by the conviction\r\nthat, with slight and immaterial distinctions, he who succeeds in giving\r\nan accurate idea of any portion of this wild region must necessarily\r\nconvey a tolerably correct notion of the whole.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the changes produced by man, the eternal round of the\r\nseasons is unbroken. Summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, return in\r\ntheir stated order with a sublime precision, affording to man one of the\r\nnoblest of all the occasions he enjoys of proving the high powers of\r\nhis far-reaching mind, in compassing the laws that control their exact\r\nuniformity, and in calculating their never-ending revolutions.\r\n\r\nCenturies of summer suns had warmed the tops of the same noble oaks and\r\npines, sending their heats even to the tenacious roots, when voices were\r\nheard calling to each other, in the depths of a forest, of which the\r\nleafy surface lay bathed in the brilliant light of a cloudless day\r\nin June, while the trunks of the trees rose in gloomy grandeur in the\r\nshades beneath. The calls were in different tones, evidently proceeding\r\nfrom two men who had lost their way, and were searching in different\r\ndirections for their path. At length a shout proclaimed success, and\r\npresently a man of gigantic mould broke out of the tangled labyrinth\r\nof a small swamp, emerging into an opening that appeared to have been\r\nformed partly by the ravages of the wind, and partly by those of fire.\r\nThis little area, which afforded a good view of the sky, although it was\r\npretty well filled with dead trees, lay on the side of one of the high\r\nhills, or low mountains, into which nearly the whole surface of the\r\nadjacent country was broken.\r\n\r\n"Here is room to breathe in!" exclaimed the liberated forester, as soon\r\nas he found himself under a clear sky, shaking his huge frame like a\r\nmastiff that has just escaped from a snowbank. "Hurrah! Deerslayer; here\r\nis daylight, at last, and yonder is the lake."\r\n\r\nThese words were scarcely uttered when the second forester dashed\r\naside the bushes of the swamp, and appeared in the area. After making\r\na hurried adjustment of his arms and disordered dress, he joined his\r\ncompanion, who had already begun his disposition for a halt.\r\n\r\n"Do you know this spot!" demanded the one called Deerslayer, "or do you\r\nshout at the sight of the sun?"\r\n\r\n"Both, lad, both; I know the spot, and am not sorry to see so useful\r\na fri\'nd as the sun. Now we have got the p\'ints of the compass in our\r\nminds once more, and \'t will be our own faults if we let anything turn\r\nthem topsy-turvy ag\'in, as has just happened. My name is not Hurry\r\nHarry, if this be not the very spot where the land-hunters camped the\r\nlast summer, and passed a week. See I yonder are the dead bushes of\r\ntheir bower, and here is the spring. Much as I like the sun, boy, I\'ve\r\nno occasion for it to tell me it is noon; this stomach of mine is as\r\ngood a time-piece as is to be found in the colony, and it already p\'ints\r\nto half-past twelve. So open the wallet, and let us wind up for another\r\nsix hours\' run."\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion, both set themselves about making the preparations\r\nnecessary for their usual frugal but hearty meal. We will profit by this\r\npause in the discourse to give the reader some idea of the appearance of\r\nthe men, each of whom is destined to enact no insignificant part in our\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been easy to find a more noble specimen of vigorous\r\nmanhood than was offered in the person of him who called himself Hurry\r\nHarry. His real name was Henry March but the frontiersmen having caught\r\nthe practice of giving sobriquets from the Indians, the appellation of\r\nHurry was far oftener applied to him than his proper designation, and\r\nnot unfrequently he was termed Hurry Skurry, a nickname he had obtained\r\nfrom a dashing, reckless offhand manner, and a physical restlessness\r\nthat kept him so constantly on the move, as to cause him to be known\r\nalong the whole line of scattered habitations that lay between the\r\nprovince and the Canadas. The stature of Hurry Harry exceeded six feet\r\nfour, and being unusually well proportioned, his strength fully realized\r\nthe idea created by his gigantic frame. The face did no discredit to the\r\nrest of the man, for it was both good-humored and handsome. His air was\r\nfree, and though his manner necessarily partook of the rudeness of a\r\nborder life, the grandeur that pervaded so noble a physique prevented it\r\nfrom becoming altogether vulgar.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer, as Hurry called his companion, was a very different person\r\nin appearance, as well as in character. In stature he stood about\r\nsix feet in his moccasins, but his frame was comparatively light and\r\nslender, showing muscles, however, that promised unusual agility, if not\r\nunusual strength. His face would have had little to recommend it except\r\nyouth, were it not for an expression that seldom failed to win upon\r\nthose who had leisure to examine it, and to yield to the feeling of\r\nconfidence it created. This expression was simply that of guileless\r\ntruth, sustained by an earnestness of purpose, and a sincerity of\r\nfeeling, that rendered it remarkable. At times this air of integrity\r\nseemed to be so simple as to awaken the suspicion of a want of the\r\nusual means to discriminate between artifice and truth; but few came in\r\nserious contact with the man, without losing this distrust in respect\r\nfor his opinions and motives.\r\n\r\nBoth these frontiersmen were still young, Hurry having reached the\r\nage of six or eight and twenty, while Deerslayer was several years his\r\njunior. Their attire needs no particular description, though it may\r\nbe well to add that it was composed in no small degree of dressed\r\ndeer-skins, and had the usual signs of belonging to those who pass their\r\ntime between the skirts of civilized society and the boundless forests.\r\nThere was, notwithstanding, some attention to smartness and the\r\npicturesque in the arrangements of Deerslayer\'s dress, more particularly\r\nin the part connected with his arms and accoutrements. His rifle was in\r\nperfect condition, the handle of his hunting-knife was neatly carved,\r\nhis powder-horn was ornamented with suitable devices lightly cut into\r\nthe material, and his shot-pouch was decorated with wampum.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Hurry Harry, either from constitutional recklessness,\r\nor from a secret consciousness how little his appearance required\r\nartificial aids, wore everything in a careless, slovenly manner, as\r\nif he felt a noble scorn for the trifling accessories of dress and\r\nornaments. Perhaps the peculiar effect of his fine form and great\r\nstature was increased rather than lessened, by this unstudied and\r\ndisdainful air of indifference.\r\n\r\n"Come, Deerslayer, fall to, and prove that you have a Delaware stomach,\r\nas you say you have had a Delaware edication," cried Hurry, setting the\r\nexample by opening his mouth to receive a slice of cold venison steak\r\nthat would have made an entire meal for a European peasant; "fall to,\r\nlad, and prove your manhood on this poor devil of a doe with your teeth,\r\nas you\'ve already done with your rifle."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, Hurry, there\'s little manhood in killing a doe, and that too\r\nout of season; though there might be some in bringing down a painter\r\nor a catamount," returned the other, disposing himself to comply. "The\r\nDelawares have given me my name, not so much on account of a bold heart,\r\nas on account of a quick eye, and an actyve foot. There may not be any\r\ncowardyce in overcoming a deer, but sartain it is, there\'s no great\r\nvalor."\r\n\r\n"The Delawares themselves are no heroes," muttered Hurry through his\r\nteeth, the mouth being too full to permit it to be fairly opened, "or\r\nthey would never have allowed them loping vagabonds, the Mingos, to make\r\nthem women."\r\n\r\n"That matter is not rightly understood--has never been rightly\r\nexplained," said Deerslayer earnestly, for he was as zealous a friend as\r\nhis companion was dangerous as an enemy; "the Mengwe fill the woods with\r\ntheir lies, and misconstruct words and treaties. I have now lived ten\r\nyears with the Delawares, and know them to be as manful as any other\r\nnation, when the proper time to strike comes."\r\n\r\n"Harkee, Master Deerslayer, since we are on the subject, we may as\r\nwell open our minds to each other in a man-to-man way; answer me one\r\nquestion; you have had so much luck among the game as to have gotten\r\na title, it would seem, but did you ever hit anything human or\r\nintelligible: did you ever pull trigger on an inimy that was capable of\r\npulling one upon you?"\r\n\r\nThis question produced a singular collision between mortification and\r\ncorrect feeling, in the bosom of the youth, that was easily to be traced\r\nin the workings of his ingenuous countenance. The struggle was short,\r\nhowever; uprightness of heart soon getting the better of false pride and\r\nfrontier boastfulness.\r\n\r\n"To own the truth, I never did," answered Deerslayer; "seeing that a\r\nfitting occasion never offered. The Delawares have been peaceable since\r\nmy sojourn with \'em, and I hold it to be onlawful to take the life of\r\nman, except in open and generous warfare."\r\n\r\n"What! did you never find a fellow thieving among your traps and\r\nskins, and do the law on him with your own hands, by way of saving the\r\nmagistrates trouble in the settlements, and the rogue himself the cost\r\nof the suit!"\r\n\r\n"I am no trapper, Hurry," returned the young man proudly: "I live by the\r\nrifle, a we\'pon at which I will not turn my back on any man of my years,\r\natween the Hudson and the St. Lawrence. I never offer a skin that has\r\nnot a hole in its head besides them which natur\' made to see with or to\r\nbreathe through."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, this is all very well, in the animal way, though it makes but a\r\npoor figure alongside of scalps and ambushes. Shooting an Indian from an\r\nambush is acting up to his own principles, and now we have what you call\r\na lawful war on our hands, the sooner you wipe that disgrace off your\r\ncharacter, the sounder will be your sleep; if it only come from knowing\r\nthere is one inimy the less prowling in the woods. I shall not frequent\r\nyour society long, friend Natty, unless you look higher than four-footed\r\nbeasts to practice your rifle on."\r\n\r\n"Our journey is nearly ended, you say, Master March, and we can part\r\nto-night, if you see occasion. I have a fri\'nd waiting for me, who will\r\nthink it no disgrace to consort with a fellow-creatur\' that has never\r\nyet slain his kind."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what has brought that skulking Delaware into this part of\r\nthe country so early in the season," muttered Hurry to himself, in a way\r\nto show equally distrust and a recklessness of its betrayal. "Where did\r\nyou say the young chief was to give you the meeting?"\r\n\r\n"At a small round rock, near the foot of the lake, where they tell me,\r\nthe tribes are given to resorting to make their treaties, and to bury\r\ntheir hatchets. This rock have I often heard the Delawares mention,\r\nthough lake and rock are equally strangers to me. The country is claimed\r\nby both Mingos and Mohicans, and is a sort of common territory to\r\nfish and hunt through, in time of peace, though what it may become in\r\nwar-time, the Lord only knows!"\r\n\r\n"Common territory" exclaimed Hurry, laughing aloud. "I should like to\r\nknow what Floating Tom Hutter would say to that! He claims the lake as\r\nhis own property, in vartue of fifteen years\' possession, and will not\r\nbe likely to give it up to either Mingo or Delaware without a battle for\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"And what will the colony say to such a quarrel--all this country must\r\nhave some owner, the gentry pushing their cravings into the wilderness,\r\neven where they never dare to ventur\', in their own persons, to look at\r\nthe land they own."\r\n\r\n"That may do in other quarters of the colony, Deerslayer, but it will\r\nnot do here. Not a human being, the Lord excepted, owns a foot of sile\r\nin this part of the country. Pen was never put to paper consarning\r\neither hill or valley hereaway, as I\'ve heard old Tom say time and\r\nag\'in, and so he claims the best right to it of any man breathing; and\r\nwhat Tom claims, he\'ll be very likely to maintain."\r\n\r\n"By what I\'ve heard you say, Hurry, this Floating Tom must be an\r\noncommon mortal; neither Mingo, Delaware, nor pale-face. His possession,\r\ntoo, has been long, by your tell, and altogether beyond frontier\r\nendurance. What\'s the man\'s history and natur\'?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to old Tom\'s human natur\', it is not much like other men\'s\r\nhuman natur\', but more like a muskrat\'s human natar\', seeing that he\r\ntakes more to the ways of that animal than to the ways of any other\r\nfellow-creatur\'. Some think he was a free liver on the salt water, in\r\nhis youth, and a companion of a sartain Kidd, who was hanged for piracy,\r\nlong afore you and I were born or acquainted, and that he came up into\r\nthese regions, thinking that the king\'s cruisers could never cross the\r\nmountains, and that he might enjoy the plunder peaceably in the woods."\r\n\r\n"Then he was wrong, Hurry; very wrong. A man can enjoy plunder peaceably\r\nnowhere."\r\n\r\n"That\'s much as his turn of mind may happen to be. I\'ve known them\r\nthat never could enjoy it at all, unless it was in the midst of a\r\njollification, and them again that enjoyed it best in a corner. Some\r\nmen have no peace if they don\'t find plunder, and some if they do. Human\r\nnature\' is crooked in these matters. Old Tom seems to belong to neither\r\nset, as he enjoys his, if plunder he has really got, with his darters,\r\nin a very quiet and comfortable way, and wishes for no more."\r\n\r\n"Ay, he has darters, too; I\'ve heard the Delawares, who\'ve hunted this\r\na way, tell their histories of these young women. Is there no mother,\r\nHurry?"\r\n\r\n"There was once, as in reason; but she has now been dead and sunk these\r\ntwo good years."\r\n\r\n"Anan?" said Deerslayer, looking up at his companion in a little\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Dead and sunk, I say, and I hope that\'s good English. The old fellow\r\nlowered his wife into the lake, by way of seeing the last of her, as I\r\ncan testify, being an eye-witness of the ceremony; but whether Tom\r\ndid it to save digging, which is no easy job among roots, or out of a\r\nconsait that water washes away sin sooner than \'arth, is more than I can\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Was the poor woman oncommon wicked, that her husband should take so\r\nmuch pains with her body?"\r\n\r\n"Not onreasonable; though she had her faults. I consider Judith Hutter\r\nto have been as graceful, and about as likely to make a good ind as\r\nany woman who had lived so long beyond the sound of church bells; and I\r\nconclude old Tom sunk her as much by way of saving pains, as by way of\r\ntaking it. There was a little steel in her temper, it\'s true, and,\r\nas old Hutter is pretty much flint, they struck out sparks\r\nonce-and-a-while; but, on the whole, they might be said to live amicable\r\nlike. When they did kindle, the listeners got some such insights into\r\ntheir past lives, as one gets into the darker parts of the woods, when\r\na stray gleam of sunshine finds its way down to the roots of the trees.\r\nBut Judith I shall always esteem, as it\'s recommend enough to one woman\r\nto be the mother of such a creatur\' as her darter, Judith Hutter!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Judith was the name the Delawares mentioned, though it was\r\npronounced after a fashion of their own. From their discourse, I do not\r\nthink the girl would much please my fancy."\r\n\r\n"Thy fancy!" exclaimed March, taking fire equally at the indifference\r\nand at the presumption of his companion, "what the devil have you to do\r\nwith a fancy, and that, too, consarning one like Judith? You are but a\r\nboy--a sapling, that has scarce got root. Judith has had men among her\r\nsuitors, ever since she was fifteen; which is now near five years; and\r\nwill not be apt even to cast a look upon a half-grown creatur\' like\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"It is June, and there is not a cloud atween us and the sun, Hurry,\r\nso all this heat is not wanted," answered the other, altogether\r\nundisturbed; "any one may have a fancy, and a squirrel has a right to\r\nmake up his mind touching a catamount."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but it might not be wise, always, to let the catamount know it,"\r\ngrowled March. "But you\'re young and thoughtless, and I\'ll overlook your\r\nignorance. Come, Deerslayer," he added, with a good-natured laugh, after\r\npausing a moment to reflect, "come, Deerslayer, we are sworn friends,\r\nand will not quarrel about a light-minded, jilting jade, just because\r\nshe happens to be handsome; more especially as you have never seen\r\nher. Judith is only for a man whose teeth show the full marks, and it\'s\r\nfoolish to be afeard of a boy. What did the Delawares say of the hussy?\r\nfor an Indian, after all, has his notions of woman-kind, as well as a\r\nwhite man."\r\n\r\n"They said she was fair to look on, and pleasant of speech; but\r\nover-given to admirers, and light-minded."\r\n\r\n"They are devils incarnate! After all, what schoolmaster is a match for\r\nan Indian, in looking into natur\'! Some people think they are only good\r\non a trail or the war-path, but I say that they are philosophers, and\r\nunderstand a man as well as they understand a beaver, and a woman as\r\nwell as they understand either. Now that\'s Judith\'s character to a\r\nribbon! To own the truth to you, Deerslayer, I should have married the\r\ngal two years since, if it had not been for two particular things, one\r\nof which was this very lightmindedness."\r\n\r\n"And what may have been the other?" demanded the hunter, who continued\r\nto eat like one that took very little interest in the subject.\r\n\r\n"T\'other was an insartainty about her having me. The hussy is handsome,\r\nand she knows it. Boy, not a tree that is growing in these hills is\r\nstraighter, or waves in the wind with an easier bend, nor did you ever\r\nsee the doe that bounded with a more nat\'ral motion. If that was all,\r\nevery tongue would sound her praises; but she has such failings that I\r\nfind it hard to overlook them, and sometimes I swear I\'ll never visit\r\nthe lake again."\r\n\r\n"Which is the reason that you always come back? Nothing is ever made\r\nmore sure by swearing about it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Deerslayer, you are a novelty in these particulars; keeping as true\r\nto education as if you had never left the settlements. With me the case\r\nis different, and I never want to clinch an idee, that I do not feel a\r\nwish to swear about it. If you know\'d all that I know consarning Judith,\r\nyou\'d find a justification for a little cussing. Now, the officers\r\nsometimes stray over to the lake, from the forts on the Mohawk, to fish\r\nand hunt, and then the creatur\' seems beside herself! You can see in the\r\nmanner which she wears her finery, and the airs she gives herself with\r\nthe gallants."\r\n\r\n"That is unseemly in a poor man\'s darter," returned Deerslayer gravely,\r\n"the officers are all gentry, and can only look on such as Judith with\r\nevil intentions."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the unsartainty, and the damper! I have my misgivings about a\r\nparticular captain, and Jude has no one to blame but her own folly, if\r\nI\'m right. On the whole, I wish to look upon her as modest and becoming,\r\nand yet the clouds that drive among these hills are not more unsartain.\r\nNot a dozen white men have ever laid eyes upon her since she was a\r\nchild, and yet her airs, with two or three of these officers, are\r\nextinguishers!"\r\n\r\n"I would think no more of such a woman, but turn my mind altogether to\r\nthe forest; that will not deceive you, being ordered and ruled by a hand\r\nthat never wavers."\r\n\r\n"If you know\'d Judith, you would see how much easier it is to say this\r\nthan it would be to do it. Could I bring my mind to be easy about the\r\nofficers, I would carry the gal off to the Mohawk by force, make her\r\nmarry me in spite of her whiffling, and leave old Tom to the care\r\nof Hetty, his other child, who, if she be not as handsome or as\r\nquick-witted as her sister, is much the most dutiful."\r\n\r\n"Is there another bird in the same nest!" asked Deerslayer, raising his\r\neyes with a species of half-awakened curiosity, "the Delawares spoke to\r\nme only of one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nat\'ral enough, when Judith Hutter and Hetty Hutter are in\r\nquestion. Hetty is only comely, while her sister, I tell thee, boy, is\r\nsuch another as is not to be found atween this and the sea: Judith is as\r\nfull of wit, and talk, and cunning, as an old Indian orator, while poor\r\nHetty is at the best but \'compass\' meant us."\r\n\r\n"Anan?" inquired, again, the Deerslayer.\r\n\r\n"Why, what the officers call \'compass meant us,\' which I understand\r\nto signify that she means always to go in the right direction, but\r\nsometimes does not know how. \'Compass\'for the p\'int, and \'meant us\' for\r\nthe intention. No, poor Hetty is what I call on the verge of ignorance,\r\nand sometimes she stumbles on one side of the line, and sometimes on\r\nt\'other."\r\n\r\n"Them are beings that the Lord has in his special care," said\r\nDeerslayer, solemnly; "for he looks carefully to all who fall short of\r\ntheir proper share of reason. The red-skins honor and respect them who\r\nare so gifted, knowing that the Evil Spirit delights more to dwell in an\r\nartful body, than in one that has no cunning to work upon."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll answer for it, then, that he will not remain long with poor Hetty;\r\nfor the child is just \'compass meant us,\' as I have told you. Old Tom\r\nhas a feeling for the gal, and so has Judith, quick-witted and glorious\r\nas she is herself; else would I not answer for her being altogether safe\r\namong the sort of men that sometimes meet on the lake shore."\r\n\r\n"I thought this water an unknown and little-frequented sheet," observed\r\nthe Deerslayer, evidently uneasy at the idea of being too near the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all that, lad, the eyes of twenty white men never having been laid\r\non it; still, twenty true-bred frontiersmen--hunters and trappers, and\r\nscouts, and the like,--can do a deal of mischief if they try. \'T would\r\nbe an awful thing to me, Deerslayer, did I find Judith married, after an\r\nabsence of six months!"\r\n\r\n"Have you the gal\'s faith, to encourage you to hope otherwise?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I know not how it is: I\'m good-looking, boy,--that much I\r\ncan see in any spring on which the sun shines,--and yet I could not get\r\nthe hussy to a promise, or even a cordial willing smile, though she will\r\nlaugh by the hour. If she has dared to marry in my absence, she\'d be\r\nlike to know the pleasures of widowhood afore she is twenty!"\r\n\r\n"You would not harm the man she has chosen, Hurry, simply because she\r\nfound him more to her liking than yourself!"\r\n\r\n"Why not! If an enemy crosses my path, will I not beat him out of it!\r\nLook at me! am I a man like to let any sneaking, crawling, skin-trader\r\nget the better of me in a matter that touches me as near as the kindness\r\nof Judith Hutter! Besides, when we live beyond law, we must be our own\r\njudges and executioners. And if a man should be found dead in the woods,\r\nwho is there to say who slew him, even admitting that the colony took\r\nthe matter in hand and made a stir about it?"\r\n\r\n"If that man should be Judith Hutter\'s husband, after what has passed, I\r\nmight tell enough, at least, to put the colony on the trail."\r\n\r\n"You!--half-grown, venison-hunting bantling! You dare to think of\r\ninforming against Hurry Harry in so much as a matter touching a mink or\r\na woodchuck!"\r\n\r\n"I would dare to speak truth, Hurry, consarning you or any man that ever\r\nlived."\r\n\r\nMarch looked at his companion, for a moment, in silent amazement; then\r\nseizing him by the throat with both hands, he shook his comparatively\r\nslight frame with a violence that menaced the dislocation of some of the\r\nbones. Nor was this done jocularly, for anger flashed from the giant\'s\r\neyes, and there were certain signs that seemed to threaten much more\r\nearnestness than the occasion would appear to call for. Whatever might\r\nbe the real intention of March, and it is probable there was none\r\nsettled in his mind, it is certain that he was unusually aroused; and\r\nmost men who found themselves throttled by one of a mould so gigantic,\r\nin such a mood, and in a solitude so deep and helpless, would have felt\r\nintimidated, and tempted to yield even the right. Not so, however, with\r\nDeerslayer. His countenance remained unmoved; his hand did not shake,\r\nand his answer was given in a voice that did not resort to the artifice\r\nof louder tones, even by way of proving its owner\'s resolution.\r\n\r\n"You may shake, Hurry, until you bring down the mountain," he said\r\nquietly, "but nothing beside truth will you shake from me. It is\r\nprobable that Judith Hutter has no husband to slay, and you may never\r\nhave a chance to waylay one, else would I tell her of your threat, in\r\nthe first conversation I held with the gal."\r\n\r\nMarch released his grip, and sat regarding the other in silent\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"I thought we had been friends," he at length added; "but you\'ve got the\r\nlast secret of mine that will ever enter your ears."\r\n\r\n"I want none, if they are to be like this. I know we live in the woods,\r\nHurry, and are thought to be beyond human laws,--and perhaps we are\r\nso, in fact, whatever it may be in right,--but there is a law and a\r\nlaw-maker, that rule across the whole continent. He that flies in the\r\nface of either need not call me a friend."\r\n\r\n"Damme, Deerslayer, if I do not believe you are at heart a Moravian, and\r\nno fair-minded, plain-dealing hunter, as you\'ve pretended to be!"\r\n\r\n"Fair-minded or not, Hurry, you will find me as plaindealing in deeds\r\nas I am in words. But this giving way to sudden anger is foolish, and\r\nproves how little you have sojourned with the red man. Judith Hutter no\r\ndoubt is still single, and you spoke but as the tongue ran, and not as\r\nthe heart felt. There\'s my hand, and we will say and think no more about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHurry seemed more surprised than ever; then he burst forth in a loud,\r\ngood-natured laugh, which brought tears to his eyes. After this he\r\naccepted the offered hand, and the parties became friends.\r\n\r\n"\'T would have been foolish to quarrel about an idee," March cried,\r\nas he resumed his meal, "and more like lawyers in the towns than like\r\nsensible men in the woods. They tell me, Deerslayer, much ill-blood\r\ngrows out of idees among the people in the lower counties, and that they\r\nsometimes get to extremities upon them."\r\n\r\n"That do they,--that do they; and about other matters that might better\r\nbe left to take care of themselves. I have heard the Moravians say that\r\nthere are lands in which men quarrel even consarning their religion; and\r\nif they can get their tempers up on such a subject, Hurry, the Lord have\r\nMarcy on \'em. Howsoever, there is no occasion for our following their\r\nexample, and more especially about a husband that this Judith Hutter\r\nmay never see, or never wish to see. For my part, I feel more cur\'osity\r\nabout the feeble-witted sister than about your beauty. There\'s\r\nsomething that comes close to a man\'s feelin\'s, when he meets with a\r\nfellow-creatur\' that has all the outward show of an accountable mortal,\r\nand who fails of being what he seems, only through a lack of reason.\r\nThis is bad enough in a man, but when it comes to a woman, and she a\r\nyoung, and maybe a winning creatur\' it touches all the pitiful thoughts\r\nhis natur\' has. God knows, Hurry, that such poor things be defenceless\r\nenough with all their wits about \'em; but it\'s a cruel fortun\' when that\r\ngreat protector and guide fails \'em."\r\n\r\n"Hark, Deerslayer,--you know what the hunters, and trappers, and\r\npeltry-men in general be; and their best friends will not deny that\r\nthey are headstrong and given to having their own way, without much\r\nbethinking \'em of other people\'s rights or feelin\'s,--and yet I don\'t\r\nthink the man is to be found, in all this region, who would harm Hetty\r\nHutter, if he could; no, not even a red-skin."\r\n\r\n"Therein, fri\'nd Hurry, you do the Delawares, at least, and all their\r\nallied tribes, only justice, for a red-skin looks upon a being thus\r\nstruck by God\'s power as especially under his care. I rejoice to hear\r\nwhat you say, however, I rejoice to hear it; but as the sun is beginning\r\nto turn towards the afternoon\'s sky, had we not better strike the trail\r\nagain, and make forward, that we may get an opportunity of seeing these\r\nwonderful sisters?"\r\n\r\nHarry March giving a cheerful assent, the remnants of the meal were\r\nsoon collected; then the travelers shouldered their packs, resumed their\r\narms, and, quitting the little area of light, they again plunged into\r\nthe deep shadows of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\n    "Thou\'rt passing from the lake\'s green side,\r\n    And the hunter\'s hearth away;\r\n    For the time of flowers, for the summer\'s pride,\r\n    Daughter! thou canst not stay."\r\n\r\n    Mrs.  Hemans, "Edith.  A Tale of the Woods" II.  191-94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur two adventurers had not far to go. Hurry knew the direction, as soon\r\nas he had found the open spot and the spring, and he now led on with the\r\nconfident step of a man assured of his object. The forest was dark, as a\r\nmatter of course, but it was no longer obstructed by underbrush, and the\r\nfooting was firm and dry. After proceeding near a mile, March stopped,\r\nand began to cast about him with an inquiring look, examining the\r\ndifferent objects with care, and occasionally turning his eyes on the\r\ntrunks of the fallen trees, with which the ground was well sprinkled,\r\nas is usually the case in an American wood, especially in those parts of\r\nthe country where timber has not yet become valuable.\r\n\r\n"This must be the place, Deerslayer," March at length observed; "here is\r\na beech by the side of a hemlock, with three pines at hand, and yonder\r\nis a white birch with a broken top; and yet I see no rock, nor any of\r\nthe branches bent down, as I told you would be the case."\r\n\r\n"Broken branches are onskilful landmarks, as the least exper\'enced know\r\nthat branches don\'t often break of themselves," returned the other; "and\r\nthey also lead to suspicion and discoveries. The Delawares never trust\r\nto broken branches, unless it is in friendly times, and on an open\r\ntrail. As for the beeches, and pines, and hemlocks, why, they are to be\r\nseen on all sides of us, not only by twos and threes, but by forties,\r\nand fifties, and hundreds."\r\n\r\n"Very true, Deerslayer, but you never calculate on position. Here is a\r\nbeech and a hemlock--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and there is another beech and a hemlock, as loving as two\r\nbrothers, or, for that matter, more loving than some brothers; and\r\nyonder are others, for neither tree is a rarity in these woods. I fear\r\nme, Hurry, you are better at trapping beaver and shooting bears, than\r\nat leading on a blindish sort of a trail. Ha! there\'s what you wish to\r\nfind, a\'ter all!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Deerslayer, this is one of your Delaware pretensions, for hang me\r\nif I see anything but these trees, which do seem to start up around us\r\nin a most onaccountable and perplexing manner."\r\n\r\n"Look this-a-way, Hurry--here, in a line with the black oak--don\'t\r\nyou see the crooked sapling that is hooked up in the branches of the\r\nbass-wood, near it? Now, that sapling was once snow-ridden, and got\r\nthe bend by its weight; but it never straightened itself, and fastened\r\nitself in among the bass-wood branches in the way you see. The hand of\r\nman did that act of kindness for it."\r\n\r\n"That hand was mine!" exclaimed Hurry; "I found the slender young\r\nthing bent to the airth, like an unfortunate creatur\' borne down by\r\nmisfortune, and stuck it up where you see it. After all, Deerslayer, I\r\nmust allow, you\'re getting to have an oncommon good eye for the woods!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis improving, Hurry--\'tis improving I will acknowledge; but \'tis only\r\na child\'s eye, compared to some I know. There\'s Tamenund, now, though\r\na man so old that few remember when he was in his prime, Tamenund lets\r\nnothing escape his look, which is more like the scent of a hound than\r\nthe sight of an eye. Then Uncas, the father of Chingachgook, and the\r\nlawful chief of the Mohicans, is another that it is almost hopeless to\r\npass unseen. I\'m improving, I will allow--I\'m improving, but far from\r\nbeing perfect, as yet."\r\n\r\n"And who is this Chingachgook, of whom you talk so much, Deerslayer!"\r\nasked Hurry, as he moved off in the direction of the righted sapling; "a\r\nloping red-skin, at the best, I make no question."\r\n\r\n"Not so, Hurry, but the best of loping red-skins, as you call \'em. If he\r\nhad his rights, he would be a great chief; but, as it is, he is only\r\na brave and just-minded Delaware; respected, and even obeyed in some\r\nthings,\'tis true, but of a fallen race, and belonging to a fallen\r\npeople. Ah! Harry March, \'twould warm the heart within you to sit in\r\ntheir lodges of a winter\'s night, and listen to the traditions of the\r\nancient greatness and power of the Mohicans!"\r\n\r\n"Harkee, fri\'nd Nathaniel," said Hurry, stopping short to face his\r\ncompanion, in order that his words might carry greater weight with them,\r\n"if a man believed all that other people choose to say in their own\r\nfavor, he might get an oversized opinion of them, and an undersized\r\nopinion of himself. These red-skins are notable boasters, and I set down\r\nmore than half of their traditions as pure talk."\r\n\r\n"There is truth in what you say, Hurry, I\'ll not deny it, for I\'ve seen\r\nit, and believe it. They do boast, but then that is a gift from natur\';\r\nand it\'s sinful to withstand nat\'ral gifts. See; this is the spot you\r\ncome to find!" This remark cut short the discourse, and both the men\r\nnow gave all their attention to the object immediately before them.\r\nDeerslayer pointed out to his companion the trunk of a huge linden, or\r\nbass-wood, as it is termed in the language of the country, which had\r\nfilled its time, and fallen by its own weight. This tree, like so many\r\nmillions of its brethren, lay where it had fallen, and was mouldering\r\nunder the slow but certain influence of the seasons. The decay, however,\r\nhad attacked its centre, even while it stood erect in the pride of\r\nvegetation, bellowing out its heart, as disease sometimes destroys the\r\nvitals of animal life, even while a fair exterior is presented to the\r\nobserver. As the trunk lay stretched for near a hundred feet along the\r\nearth, the quick eye of the hunter detected this peculiarity, and from\r\nthis and other circumstances, he knew it to be the tree of which March\r\nwas in search.\r\n\r\n"Ay, here we have what we want," cried Hurry, looking in at the larger\r\nend of the linden; "everything is as snug as if it had been left in an\r\nold woman\'s cupboard. Come, lend me a hand, Deerslayer, and we\'ll be\r\nafloat in half an hour."\r\n\r\nAt this call the hunter joined his companion, and the two went to work\r\ndeliberately and regularly, like men accustomed to the sort of thing in\r\nwhich they were employed. In the first place, Hurry removed some pieces\r\nof bark that lay before the large opening in the tree, and which the\r\nother declared to be disposed in a way that would have been more likely\r\nto attract attention than to conceal the cover, had any straggler passed\r\nthat way. The two then drew out a bark canoe, containing its seats,\r\npaddles, and other appliances, even to fishing-lines and rods. This\r\nvessel was by no means small; but such was its comparative lightness,\r\nand so gigantic was the strength of Hurry, that the latter shouldered it\r\nwith seeming ease, declining all assistance, even in the act of raising\r\nit to the awkward position in which he was obliged to hold it.\r\n\r\n"Lead ahead, Deerslayer," said March, "and open the bushes; the rest I\r\ncan do for myself."\r\n\r\nThe other obeyed, and the men left the spot, Deerslayer clearing the\r\nway for his companion, and inclining to the right or to the left, as the\r\nlatter directed. In about ten minutes they both broke suddenly into the\r\nbrilliant light of the sun, on a low gravelly point, that was washed by\r\nwater on quite half its outline.\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of surprise broke from the lips of Deerslayer, an\r\nexclamation that was low and guardedly made, however, for his habits\r\nwere much more thoughtful and regulated than those of the reckless\r\nHurry, when on reaching the margin of the lake, he beheld the view that\r\nunexpectedly met his gaze. It was, in truth, sufficiently striking to\r\nmerit a brief description. On a level with the point lay a broad sheet\r\nof water, so placid and limpid that it resembled a bed of the pure\r\nmountain atmosphere, compressed into a setting of hills and woods.\r\nIts length was about three leagues, while its breadth was irregular,\r\nexpanding to half a league, or even more, opposite to the point, and\r\ncontracting to less than half that distance, more to the southward. Of\r\ncourse, its margin was irregular, being indented by bays, and broken\r\nby many projecting, low points. At its northern, or nearest end, it was\r\nbounded by an isolated mountain, lower land falling off east and west,\r\ngracefully relieving the sweep of the outline. Still the character\r\nof the country was mountainous; high hills, or low mountains, rising\r\nabruptly from the water, on quite nine tenths of its circuit. The\r\nexceptions, indeed, only served a little to vary the scene; and\r\neven beyond the parts of the shore that were comparatively low, the\r\nbackground was high, though more distant.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking peculiarities of this scene were its solemn\r\nsolitude and sweet repose. On all sides, wherever the eye turned,\r\nnothing met it but the mirror-like surface of the lake, the placid view\r\nof heaven, and the dense setting of woods. So rich and fleecy were the\r\noutlines of the forest, that scarce an opening could be seen, the\r\nwhole visible earth, from the rounded mountain-top to the water\'s edge,\r\npresenting one unvaried hue of unbroken verdure. As if vegetation were\r\nnot satisfied with a triumph so complete, the trees overhung the lake\r\nitself, shooting out towards the light; and there were miles along its\r\neastern shore, where a boat might have pulled beneath the branches of\r\ndark Rembrandt-looking hemlocks, "quivering aspens," and melancholy\r\npines. In a word, the hand of man had never yet defaced or deformed any\r\npart of this native scene, which lay bathed in the sunlight, a glorious\r\npicture of affluent forest grandeur, softened by the balminess of June,\r\nand relieved by the beautiful variety afforded by the presence of so\r\nbroad an expanse of water.\r\n\r\n"This is grand!--\'tis solemn!--\'tis an edication of itself, to look\r\nupon!" exclaimed Deerslayer, as he stood leaning on his rifle, and\r\ngazing to the right and left, north and south, above and beneath, in\r\nwhichever direction his eye could wander; "not a tree disturbed even by\r\nred-skin hand, as I can discover, but everything left in the ordering of\r\nthe Lord, to live and die according to his own designs and laws! Hurry,\r\nyour Judith ought to be a moral and well disposed young woman, if\r\nshe has passed half the time you mention in the centre of a spot so\r\nfavored."\r\n\r\n"That\'s naked truth; and yet the gal has the vagaries. All her time\r\nhas not been passed here, howsoever, old Tom having the custom, afore\r\nI know\'d him, of going to spend the winters in the neighborhood of the\r\nsettlers, or under the guns of the forts. No, no, Jude has caught\r\nmore than is for her good from the settlers, and especially from the\r\ngallantifying officers."\r\n\r\n"If she has--if she has, Hurry, this is a school to set her mind right\r\nag\'in. But what is this I see off here, abreast of us, that seems too\r\nsmall for an island, and too large for a boat, though it stands in the\r\nmidst of the water!\r\n\r\n"Why, that is what these galantine gentry from the forts call Muskrat\r\nCastle; and old Tom himself will grin at the name, though it bears so\r\nhard on his own natur\' and character. \'Tis the stationary house, there\r\nbeing two; this, which never moves, and the other, that floats, being\r\nsometimes in one part of the lake and sometimes in another. The last\r\ngoes by the name of the ark, though what may be the meaning of the word\r\nis more than I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"It must come from the missionaries, Hurry, whom I have heard speak\r\nand read of such a thing. They say that the \'arth was once covered with\r\nwater, and that Noah, with his children, was saved from drowning by\r\nbuilding a vessel called an ark, in which he embarked in season. Some of\r\nthe Delawares believe this tradition, and some deny it; but it behooves\r\nyou and me, as white men born, to put our faith in its truth. Do you see\r\nanything of this ark?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis down south, no doubt, or anchored in some of the bays. But the\r\ncanoe is ready, and fifteen minutes will carry two such paddles as\r\nyour\'n and mine to the castle."\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion, Deerslayer helped his companion to place the\r\ndifferent articles in the canoe, which was already afloat. This was no\r\nsooner done than the two frontiermen embarked, and by a vigorous push\r\nsent the light bark some eight or ten rods from the shore. Hurry now\r\ntook the seat in the stern, while Deerslayer placed himself forward, and\r\nby leisurely but steady strokes of the paddles, the canoe glided across\r\nthe placid sheet, towards the extraordinary-looking structure that the\r\nformer had styled Muskrat Castle. Several times the men ceased paddling,\r\nand looked about them at the scene, as new glimpses opened from behind\r\npoints, enabling them to see farther down the lake, or to get broader\r\nviews of the wooded mountains. The only changes, however, were in the\r\nnew forms of the hills, the varying curvature of the bays, and the wider\r\nreaches of the valley south; the whole earth apparently being clothed in\r\na gala-dress of leaves.\r\n\r\n"This is a sight to warm the heart!" exclaimed Deerslayer, when they had\r\nthus stopped for the fourth or fifth time; "the lake seems made to let\r\nus get an insight into the noble forests; and land and water alike stand\r\nin the beauty of God\'s providence! Do you say, Hurry, that there is no\r\nman who calls himself lawful owner of all these glories?"\r\n\r\n"None but the King, lad. He may pretend to some right of that natur\',\r\nbut he is so far away that his claim will never trouble old Tom Hutter,\r\nwho has got possession, and is like to keep it as long as his life\r\nlasts. Tom is no squatter, not being on land; I call him a floater."\r\n\r\n"I invy that man! I know it\'s wrong, and I strive ag\'in the feelin\', but\r\nI invy that man! Don\'t think, Hurry, that I\'m consorting any plan to put\r\nmyself in his moccasins, for such a thought doesn\'t harbor in my mind;\r\nbut I can\'t help a little invy! \'Tis a nat\'ral feelin\', and the best of\r\nus are but nat\'ral, a\'ter all, and give way to such feelin\'s at times."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve only to marry Hetty to inherit half the estate," cried Hurry,\r\nlaughing; "the gal is comely; nay, if it wasn\'t for her sister\'s beauty\r\nshe would be even handsome; and then her wits are so small that you may\r\neasily convart her into one of your own way of thinking, in all things.\r\nDo you take Hetty off the old fellow\'s hands, and I\'ll engage he\'ll give\r\nyou an interest in every deer you can knock over within five miles of\r\nhis lake."\r\n\r\n"Does game abound!" suddenly demanded the other, who paid but little\r\nattention to March\'s raillery.\r\n\r\n"It has the country to itself. Scarce a trigger is pulled on it; and as\r\nfor the trappers, this is not a region they greatly frequent. I ought\r\nnot to be so much here myself, but Jude pulls one way, while the beaver\r\npulls another. More than a hundred Spanish dollars has that creatur\'\r\ncost me the last two seasons, and yet I could not forego the wish to\r\nlook upon her face once more."\r\n\r\n"Do the redmen often visit this lake, Hurry?" continued Deerslayer,\r\npursuing his own train of thought.\r\n\r\n"Why, they come and go; sometimes in parties, and sometimes singly. The\r\ncountry seems to belong to no native tribe in particular; and so it has\r\nfallen into the hands of the Hutter tribe. The old man tells me that\r\nsome sharp ones have been wheedling the Mohawks for an Indian deed,\r\nin order to get a title out of the colony; but nothing has come of it,\r\nseeing that no one heavy enough for such a trade has yet meddled\r\nwith the matter. The hunters have a good life-lease still of this\r\nwilderness."\r\n\r\n"So much the better, so much the better, Hurry. If I was King of\r\nEngland, the man that felled one of these trees without good occasion\r\nfor the timber, should be banished to a desarted and forlorn region, in\r\nwhich no fourfooted animal ever trod. Right glad am I that Chingachgook\r\napp\'inted our meeting on this lake, for hitherto eye of mine never\r\nlooked on such a glorious spectacle."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you\'ve kept so much among the Delawares, in whose\r\ncountry there are no lakes. Now, farther north and farther west these\r\nbits of water abound; and you\'re young, and may yet live to see \'em.\r\nBut though there be other lakes, Deerslayer, there\'s no other Judith\r\nHutter!"\r\n\r\nAt this remark his companion smiled, and then he dropped his paddle into\r\nthe water, as if in consideration of a lover\'s haste. Both now pulled\r\nvigorously until they got within a hundred yards of the "castle," as\r\nHurry familiarly called the house of Hutter, when they again ceased\r\npaddling; the admirer of Judith restraining his impatience the more\r\nreadily, as he perceived that the building was untenanted, at the\r\nmoment. This new pause was to enable Deerslayer to survey the singular\r\nedifice, which was of a construction so novel as to merit a particular\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nMuskrat Castle, as the house had been facetiously named by some waggish\r\nofficer, stood in the open lake, at a distance of fully a quarter of a\r\nmile from the nearest shore. On every other side the water extended much\r\nfarther, the precise position being distant about two miles from the\r\nnorthern end of the sheet, and near, if not quite, a mile from its\r\neastern shore. As there was not the smallest appearance of any island,\r\nbut the house stood on piles, with the water flowing beneath it, and\r\nDeerslayer had already discovered that the lake was of a great depth,\r\nhe was fain to ask an explanation of this singular circumstance. Hurry\r\nsolved the difficulty by telling him that on this spot alone, a long,\r\nnarrow shoal, which extended for a few hundred yards in a north and\r\nsouth direction, rose within six or eight feet of the surface of\r\nthe lake, and that Hutter had driven piles into it, and placed his\r\nhabitation on them, for the purpose of security.\r\n\r\n"The old fellow was burnt out three times, atween the Indians and the\r\nhunters; and in one affray with the red-skins he lost his only son,\r\nsince which time he has taken to the water for safety. No one can attack\r\nhim here, without coming in a boat, and the plunder and scalps would\r\nscarce be worth the trouble of digging out canoes. Then it\'s by no\r\nmeans sartain which would whip in such a scrimmage, for old Tom is well\r\nsupplied with arms and ammunition, and the castle, as you may see, is a\r\ntight breastwork ag\'in light shot."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had some theoretical knowledge of frontier warfare, though\r\nhe had never yet been called on to raise his hand in anger against a\r\nfellow-creature. He saw that Hurry did not overrate the strength of\r\nthis position in a military point of view, since it would not be easy to\r\nattack it without exposing the assailants to the fire of the besieged.\r\nA good deal of art had also been manifested in the disposition of\r\nthe timber of which the building was constructed and which afforded a\r\nprotection much greater than was usual to the ordinary log-cabins of the\r\nfrontier. The sides and ends were composed of the trunks of large pines,\r\ncut about nine feet long, and placed upright, instead of being laid\r\nhorizontally, as was the practice of the country. These logs were\r\nsquared on three sides, and had large tenons on each end. Massive sills\r\nwere secured on the heads of the piles, with suitable grooves dug out\r\nof their upper surfaces, which had been squared for the purpose, and the\r\nlower tenons of the upright pieces were placed in these grooves, giving\r\nthem secure fastening below. Plates had been laid on the upper ends\r\nof the upright logs, and were kept in their places by a similar\r\ncontrivance; the several corners of the structure being well fastened\r\nby scarfing and pinning the sills and plates. The doors were made of\r\nsmaller logs, similarly squared, and the roof was composed of light\r\npoles, firmly united, and well covered with bark.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this ingenious arrangement was to give its owner a house\r\nthat could be approached only by water, the sides of which were composed\r\nof logs closely wedged together, which were two feet thick in their\r\nthinnest parts, and which could be separated only by a deliberate and\r\nlaborious use of human hands, or by the slow operation of time. The\r\nouter surface of the building was rude and uneven, the logs being of\r\nunequal sizes; but the squared surfaces within gave both the sides and\r\ndoor as uniform an appearance as was desired, either for use or show.\r\nThe chimney was not the least singular portion of the castle, as Hurry\r\nmade his companion observe, while he explained the process by which it\r\nhad been made. The material was a stiff clay, properly worked, which had\r\nbeen put together in a mould of sticks, and suffered to harden, a foot\r\nor two at a time, commencing at the bottom. When the entire chimney had\r\nthus been raised, and had been properly bound in with outward props, a\r\nbrisk fire was kindled, and kept going until it was burned to something\r\nlike a brick-red. This had not been an easy operation, nor had it\r\nsucceeded entirely; but by dint of filling the cracks with fresh clay,\r\na safe fireplace and chimney had been obtained in the end. This part of\r\nthe work stood on the log-door, secured beneath by an extra pile. There\r\nwere a few other peculiarities about this dwelling, which will better\r\nappear in the course of the narrative.\r\n\r\n"Old Tom is full of contrivances," added Hurry, "and he set his heart on\r\nthe success of his chimney, which threatened more than once to give out\r\naltogether; but perseverance will even overcome smoke; and now he has\r\na comfortable cabin of it, though it did promise, at one time, to be a\r\nchinky sort of a flue to carry flames and fire."\r\n\r\n"You seem to know the whole history of the castle, Hurry, chimney and\r\nsides," said Deerslayer, smiling; "is love so overcoming that it causes\r\na man to study the story of his sweetheart\'s habitation?"\r\n\r\n"Partly that, lad, and partly eyesight," returned the good-natured\r\ngiant, laughing; "there was a large gang of us in the lake, the summer\r\nthe old fellow built, and we helped him along with the job. I raised no\r\nsmall part of the weight of them uprights with my own shoulders, and\r\nthe axes flew, I can inform you, Master Natty, while we were bee-ing it\r\namong the trees ashore. The old devil is no way stingy about food, and\r\nas we had often eat at his hearth, we thought we would just house him\r\ncomfortably, afore we went to Albany with our skins. Yes, many is the\r\nmeal I\'ve swallowed in Tom Hutter\'s cabins; and Hetty, though so weak in\r\nthe way of wits, has a wonderful particular way about a frying-pan or a\r\ngridiron!\r\n\r\n"While the parties were thus discoursing, the canoe had been gradually\r\ndrawing nearer to the "castle," and was now so close as to require but\r\na single stroke of a paddle to reach the landing. This was at a floored\r\nplatform in front of the entrance, that might have been some twenty feet\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n"Old Tom calls this sort of a wharf his door-yard," observed Hurry, as\r\nhe fastened the canoe, after he and his Companion had left it: "and the\r\ngallants from the forts have named it the castle court though what a\r\n\'court\' can have to do here is more than I can tell you, seeing that\r\nthere is no law. \'Tis as I supposed; not a soul within, but the whole\r\nfamily is off on a v\'y\'ge of discovery!"\r\n\r\nWhile Hurry was bustling about the "door-yard," examining the\r\nfishing-spears, rods, nets, and other similar appliances of a frontier\r\ncabin, Deerslayer, whose manner was altogether more rebuked and quiet,\r\nentered the building with a curiosity that was not usually exhibited by\r\none so long trained in Indian habits. The interior of the "castle" was\r\nas faultlessly neat as its exterior was novel. The entire space, some\r\ntwenty feet by forty, was subdivided into several small sleeping-rooms;\r\nthe apartment into which he first entered, serving equally for the\r\nordinary uses of its inmates, and for a kitchen. The furniture was of\r\nthe strange mixture that it is not uncommon to find in the remotely\r\nsituated log-tenements of the interior. Most of it was rude, and to the\r\nlast degree rustic; but there was a clock, with a handsome case of dark\r\nwood, in a corner, and two or three chairs, with a table and bureau,\r\nthat had evidently come from some dwelling of more than usual\r\npretension. The clock was industriously ticking, but its leaden-looking\r\nhands did no discredit to their dull aspect, for they pointed to the\r\nhour of eleven, though the sun plainly showed it was some time past\r\nthe turn of the day. There was also a dark, massive chest. The kitchen\r\nutensils were of the simplest kind, and far from numerous, but every\r\narticle was in its place, and showed the nicest care in its condition.\r\n\r\nAfter Deerslayer had cast a look about him in the outer room, he raised\r\na wooden latch, and entered a narrow passage that divided the inner\r\nend of the house into two equal parts. Frontier usages being no way\r\nscrupulous, and his curiosity being strongly excited, the young man now\r\nopened a door, and found himself in a bedroom. A single glance sufficed\r\nto show that the apartment belonged to females. The bed was of the\r\nfeathers of wild geese, and filled nearly to overflowing; but it lay in\r\na rude bunk, raised only a foot from the door. On one side of it were\r\narranged, on pegs, various dresses, of a quality much superior to what\r\none would expect to meet in such a place, with ribbons and other similar\r\narticles to correspond. Pretty shoes, with handsome silver buckles, such\r\nas were then worn by females in easy circumstances, were not wanting;\r\nand no less than six fans, of gay colors, were placed half open, in a\r\nway to catch the eye by their conceits and hues. Even the pillow, on\r\nthis side of the bed, was covered with finer linen than its companion,\r\nand it was ornamented with a small ruffle. A cap, coquettishly decorated\r\nwith ribbons, hung above it, and a pair of long gloves, such as were\r\nrarely used in those days by persons of the laboring classes, were\r\npinned ostentatiously to it, as if with an intention to exhibit them\r\nthere, if they could not be shown on the owner\'s arms.\r\n\r\nAll this Deerslayer saw, and noted with a degree of minuteness that\r\nwould have done credit to the habitual observation of his friends, the\r\nDelawares. Nor did he fail to perceive the distinction that existed\r\nbetween the appearances on the different sides of the bed, the head\r\nof which stood against the wall. On that opposite to the one just\r\ndescribed, everything was homely and uninviting, except through its\r\nperfect neatness. The few garments that were hanging from the pegs were\r\nof the coarsest materials and of the commonest forms, while nothing\r\nseemed made for show. Of ribbons there was not one; nor was there either\r\ncap or kerchief beyond those which Hutter\'s daughters might be fairly\r\nentitled to wear.\r\n\r\nIt was now several years since Deerslayer had been in a spot especially\r\ndevoted to the uses of females of his own color and race. The sight\r\nbrought back to his mind a rush of childish recollections; and he\r\nlingered in the room with a tenderness of feeling to which he had long\r\nbeen a stranger. He bethought him of his mother, whose homely vestments\r\nhe remembered to have seen hanging on pegs like those which he felt\r\nmust belong to Hetty Hutter; and he bethought himself of a sister, whose\r\nincipient and native taste for finery had exhibited itself somewhat in\r\nthe manner of that of Judith, though necessarily in a less degree. These\r\nlittle resemblances opened a long hidden vein of sensations; and as he\r\nquitted the room, it was with a saddened mien. He looked no further, but\r\nreturned slowly and thoughtfully towards the "door-yard."\r\n\r\n"If Old Tom has taken to a new calling, and has been trying his hand at\r\nthe traps," cried Hurry, who had been coolly examining the borderer\'s\r\nimplements; "if that is his humor, and you\'re disposed to remain in\r\nthese parts, we can make an oncommon comfortable season of it; for,\r\nwhile the old man and I out-knowledge the beaver, you can fish, and\r\nknock down the deer, to keep body and soul together. I\'ve always give\r\nthe poorest hunters half a share, but one as actyve and sartain as\r\nyourself might expect a full one."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee, Hurry; thank\'ee, with all my heart--but I do a little\r\nbeavering for myself as occasions offer. \'Tis true, the Delawares call\r\nme Deerslayer, but it\'s not so much because I\'m pretty fatal with the\r\nvenison as because that while I kill so many bucks and does, I\'ve never\r\nyet taken the life of a fellow-creatur\'. They say their traditions do\r\nnot tell of another who had shed so much blood of animals that had not\r\nshed the blood of man."\r\n\r\n"I hope they don\'t account you chicken-hearted, lad! A faint-hearted man\r\nis like a no-tailed beaver."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe, Hurry, that they account me as out-of-the-way\r\ntimorsome, even though they may not account me as out-of-the-way brave.\r\nBut I\'m not quarrelsome; and that goes a great way towards keeping blood\r\noff the hands, among the hunters and red-skins; and then, Harry March,\r\nit keeps blood off the conscience, too."\r\n\r\n"Well, for my part I account game, a red-skin, and a Frenchman as pretty\r\nmuch the same thing; though I\'m as onquarrelsome a man, too, as there is\r\nin all the colonies. I despise a quarreller as I do a cur-dog; but one\r\nhas no need to be over-scrupulsome when it\'s the right time to show the\r\nflint."\r\n\r\n"I look upon him as the most of a man who acts nearest the right, Hurry.\r\nBut this is a glorious spot, and my eyes never a-weary looking at it!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis your first acquaintance with a lake; and these ideas come over us\r\nall at such times. Lakes have a gentle character, as I say, being pretty\r\nmuch water and land, and points and bays."\r\n\r\nAs this definition by no means met the feelings that were uppermost in\r\nthe mind of the young hunter, he made no immediate answer, but stood\r\ngazing at the dark hills and the glassy water in silent enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"Have the Governor\'s or the King\'s people given this lake a name?" he\r\nsuddenly asked, as if struck with a new idea. "If they\'ve not begun to\r\nblaze their trees, and set up their compasses, and line off their maps,\r\nit\'s likely they\'ve not bethought them to disturb natur\' with a name."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve not got to that, yet; and the last time I went in with skins,\r\none of the King\'s surveyors was questioning me consarning all the region\r\nhereabouts. He had heard that there was a lake in this quarter, and\r\nhad got some general notions about it, such as that there was water and\r\nhills; but how much of either, he know\'d no more than you know of the\r\nMohawk tongue. I didn\'t open the trap any wider than was necessary,\r\ngiving him but poor encouragement in the way of farms and clearings. In\r\nshort, I left on his mind some such opinion of this country, as a man\r\ngets of a spring of dirty water, with a path to it that is so muddy that\r\none mires afore he sets out. He told me they hadn\'t got the spot down\r\nyet on their maps, though I conclude that is a mistake, for he showed me\r\nhis parchment, and there is a lake down on it, where there is no lake\r\nin fact, and which is about fifty miles from the place where it ought to\r\nbe, if they meant it for this. I don\'t think my account will encourage\r\nhim to mark down another, by way of improvement."\r\n\r\nHere Hurry laughed heartily, such tricks being particularly grateful to\r\na set of men who dreaded the approaches of civilization as a curtailment\r\nof their own lawless empire. The egregious errors that existed in the\r\nmaps of the day, all of which were made in Europe, were, moreover, a\r\nstanding topic of ridicule among them; for, if they had not science\r\nenough to make any better themselves, they had sufficient local\r\ninformation to detect the gross blunders contained in those that\r\nexisted. Any one who will take the trouble to compare these unanswerable\r\nevidences of the topographical skill of our fathers a century since,\r\nwith the more accurate sketches of our own time, will at once perceive\r\nthat the men of the woods had a sufficient justification for all their\r\ncriticism on this branch of the skill of the colonial governments, which\r\ndid not at all hesitate to place a river or a lake a degree or two out\r\nof the way, even though they lay within a day\'s march of the inhabited\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad it has no name," resumed Deerslayer, "or at least, no\r\npale-face name; for their christenings always foretell waste and\r\ndestruction. No doubt, howsoever, the red-skins have their modes of\r\nknowing it, and the hunters and trappers, too; they are likely to call\r\nthe place by something reasonable and resembling."\r\n\r\n"As for the tribes, each has its tongue, and its own way of calling\r\nthings; and they treat this part of the world just as they treat\r\nall others. Among ourselves, we\'ve got to calling the place the\r\n\'Glimmerglass,\' seeing that its whole basin is so often hinged with\r\npines, cast upward to its face as if it would throw back the hills that\r\nhang over it."\r\n\r\n"There is an outlet, I know, for all lakes have outlets, and the rock\r\nat which I am to meet Chingachgook stands near an outlet. Has that no\r\ncolony-name yet?"\r\n\r\n"In that particular they\'ve got the advantage of us, having one end, and\r\nthat the biggest, in their own keeping: they\'ve given it a name which\r\nhas found its way up to its source; names nat\'rally working up stream.\r\nNo doubt, Deerslayer, you\'ve seen the Susquehannah, down in the Delaware\r\ncountry?"\r\n\r\n"That have I, and hunted along its banks a hundred times."\r\n\r\n"That and this are the same in fact, and, I suppose, the same in sound.\r\nI am glad they\'ve been compelled to keep the redmen\'s name, for it would\r\nbe too hard to rob them of both land and name!"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer made no answer; but he stood leaning on his rifle, gazing\r\nat the view which so much delighted him. The reader is not to suppose,\r\nhowever, that it was the picturesque alone which so strongly attracted\r\nhis attention. The spot was very lovely, of a truth, and it was then\r\nseen in one of its most favorable moments, the surface of the lake\r\nbeing as smooth as glass and as limpid as pure air, throwing back\r\nthe mountains, clothed in dark pines, along the whole of its eastern\r\nboundary, the points thrusting forward their trees even to nearly\r\nhorizontal lines, while the bays were seen glittering through an\r\noccasional arch beneath, left by a vault fretted with branches and\r\nleaves. It was the air of deep repose--the solitudes, that spoke of\r\nscenes and forests untouched by the hands of man--the reign of nature,\r\nin a word, that gave so much pure delight to one of his habits and turn\r\nof mind. Still, he felt, though it was unconsciously, like a poet\r\nalso. If he found a pleasure in studying this large, and to him unusual\r\nopening into the mysteries and forms of the woods, as one is gratified\r\nin getting broader views of any subject that has long occupied his\r\nthoughts, he was not insensible to the innate loveliness of such a\r\nlandscape neither, but felt a portion of that soothing of the spirit\r\nwhich is a common attendant of a scene so thoroughly pervaded by the\r\nholy cairn of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n    "Come, shall we go and kill us venison?\r\n    And yet it irks me, the poor dappled foals,--\r\n    Being native burghers of this desert city,--\r\n    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads\r\n    Have their round haunches gored."\r\n\r\n    As You Like It, II.i.21-25\r\n\r\nHurry Harry thought more of the beauties of Judith Hutter than of those\r\nof the Glimmerglass and its accompanying scenery. As soon as he had\r\ntaken a sufficiently intimate survey of floating Tom\'s implements,\r\ntherefore, he summoned his companion to the canoe, that they might go\r\ndown the lake in quest of the family. Previously to embarking, however,\r\nHurry carefully examined the whole of the northern end of the water with\r\nan indifferent ship\'s glass, that formed a part of Hutter\'s effects. In\r\nthis scrutiny, no part of the shore was overlooked; the bays and points\r\nin particular being subjected to a closer inquiry than the rest of the\r\nwooded boundary.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis as I thought," said Hurry, laying aside the glass, "the old fellow\r\nis drifting about the south end this fine weather, and has left the\r\ncastle to defend itself. Well, now we know that he is not up this-a-way,\r\n\'twill be but a small matter to paddle down and hunt him up in his\r\nhiding-place."\r\n\r\n"Does Master Hutter think it necessary to burrow on this lake?" inquired\r\nDeerslayer, as he followed his companion into the canoe; "to my eye it\r\nis such a solitude as one might open his whole soul in, and fear no one\r\nto disarrange his thoughts or his worship."\r\n\r\n"You forget your friends the Mingos, and all the French savages. Is\r\nthere a spot on \'arth, Deerslayer, to which them disquiet rogues don\'t\r\ngo? Where is the lake, or even the deer lick, that the blackguards don\'t\r\nfind out, and having found out, don\'t, sooner or later, discolour its\r\nwater with blood."\r\n\r\n"I hear no good character of \'em, sartainly, friend Hurry, though I\'ve\r\nnever been called on, yet, to meet them, or any other mortal, on the\r\nwarpath. I dare to say that such a lovely spot as this, would not be\r\nlikely to be overlooked by such plunderers, for, though I\'ve not been\r\nin the way of quarreling with them tribes myself, the Delawares give\r\nme such an account of \'em that I\'ve pretty much set \'em down in my own\r\nmind, as thorough miscreants."\r\n\r\n"You may do that with a safe conscience, or for that matter, any other\r\nsavage you may happen to meet."\r\n\r\nHere Deerslayer protested, and as they went paddling down the lake, a\r\nhot discussion was maintained concerning the respective merits of\r\nthe pale-faces and the red-skins. Hurry had all the prejudices and\r\nantipathies of a white hunter, who generally regards the Indian as a\r\nsort of natural competitor, and not unfrequently as a natural enemy.\r\nAs a matter of course, he was loud, clamorous, dogmatical and not\r\nvery argumentative. Deerslayer, on the other hand, manifested a very\r\ndifferent temper, proving by the moderation of his language, the\r\nfairness of his views, and the simplicity of his distinctions, that he\r\npossessed every disposition to hear reason, a strong, innate desire to\r\ndo justice, and an ingenuousness that was singularly indisposed to have\r\nrecourse to sophism to maintain an argument; or to defend a prejudice.\r\nStill he was not altogether free from the influence of the latter\r\nfeeling. This tyrant of the human mind, which ruses on it prey through\r\na thousand avenues, almost as soon as men begin to think and feel, and\r\nwhich seldom relinquishes its iron sway until they cease to do\r\neither, had made some impression on even the just propensities of this\r\nindividual, who probably offered in these particulars, a fair specimen\r\nof what absence from bad example, the want of temptation to go wrong,\r\nand native good feeling can render youth.\r\n\r\n"You will allow, Deerslayer, that a Mingo is more than half devil,"\r\ncried Hurry, following up the discussion with an animation that touched\r\nclosely on ferocity, "though you want to over-persuade me that the\r\nDelaware tribe is pretty much made up of angels. Now, I gainsay that\r\nproposal, consarning white men, even. All white men are not faultless,\r\nand therefore all Indians can\'t be faultless. And so your argument is\r\nout at the elbow in the start. But this is what I call reason. Here\'s\r\nthree colors on \'arth: white, black, and red. White is the highest\r\ncolor, and therefore the best man; black comes next, and is put to live\r\nin the neighborhood of the white man, as tolerable, and fit to be made\r\nuse of; and red comes last, which shows that those that made \'em never\r\nexpected an Indian to be accounted as more than half human."\r\n\r\n"God made all three alike, Hurry."\r\n\r\n"Alike! Do you call a nigger like a white man, or me like an Indian?"\r\n\r\n"You go off at half-cock, and don\'t hear me out. God made us all, white,\r\nblack, and red; and, no doubt, had his own wise intentions in coloring\r\nus differently. Still, he made us, in the main, much the same in\r\nfeelin\'s; though I\'ll not deny that he gave each race its gifts. A\r\nwhite man\'s gifts are Christianized, while a red-skin\'s are more for the\r\nwilderness. Thus, it would be a great offence for a white man to scalp\r\nthe dead; whereas it\'s a signal vartue in an Indian. Then ag\'in, a white\r\nman cannot amboosh women and children in war, while a red-skin may. \'Tis\r\ncruel work, I\'ll allow; but for them it\'s lawful work; while for us, it\r\nwould be grievous work."\r\n\r\n"That depends on your inimy. As for scalping, or even skinning a savage,\r\nI look upon them pretty much the same as cutting off the ears of wolves\r\nfor the bounty, or stripping a bear of its hide. And then you\'re out\r\nsignificantly, as to taking the poll of a red-skin in hand, seeing that\r\nthe very colony has offered a bounty for the job; all the same as it\r\npays for wolves\' ears and crows\' heads."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and a bad business it is, Hurry. Even the Indians themselves cry\r\nshame on it, seeing it\'s ag\'in a white man\'s gifts. I do not pretend\r\nthat all that white men do, is properly Christianized, and according\r\nto the lights given them, for then they would be what they ought to be;\r\nwhich we know they are not; but I will maintain that tradition, and use,\r\nand color, and laws, make such a difference in races as to amount to\r\ngifts. I do not deny that there are tribes among the Indians that are\r\nnat\'rally pervarse and wicked, as there are nations among the whites.\r\nNow, I account the Mingos as belonging to the first, and the Frenchers,\r\nin the Canadas, to the last. In a state of lawful warfare, such as\r\nwe have lately got into, it is a duty to keep down all compassionate\r\nfeelin\'s, so far as life goes, ag\'in either; but when it comes to\r\nscalps, it\'s a very different matter."\r\n\r\n"Just hearken to reason, if you please, Deerslayer, and tell me if the\r\ncolony can make an onlawful law? Isn\'t an onlawful law more ag\'in natur\'\r\nthan scalpin\' a savage? A law can no more be onlawful, than truth can be\r\na lie."\r\n\r\n"That sounds reasonable; but it has a most onreasonable bearing, Hurry.\r\nLaws don\'t all come from the same quarter. God has given us his\'n, and\r\nsome come from the colony, and others come from the King and Parliament.\r\nWhen the colony\'s laws, or even the King\'s laws, run ag\'in the laws of\r\nGod, they get to be onlawful, and ought not to be obeyed. I hold to\r\na white man\'s respecting white laws, so long as they do not cross the\r\ntrack of a law comin\' from a higher authority; and for a red man to obey\r\nhis own red-skin usages, under the same privilege. But, \'t is useless\r\ntalking, as each man will think fir himself, and have his say agreeable\r\nto his thoughts. Let us keep a good lookout for your friend Floating\r\nTom, lest we pass him, as he lies hidden under this bushy shore."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had not named the borders of the lake amiss. Along their\r\nwhole length, the smaller trees overhung the water, with their branches\r\noften dipping in the transparent element. The banks were steep, even from\r\nthe narrow strand; and, as vegetation invariably struggles towards\r\nthe light, the effect was precisely that at which the lover of the\r\npicturesque would have aimed, had the ordering of this glorious setting\r\nof forest been submitted to his control. The points and bays, too, were\r\nsufficiently numerous to render the outline broken and diversified. As\r\nthe canoe kept close along the western side of the lake, with a view,\r\nas Hurry had explained to his companion, of reconnoitering for enemies,\r\nbefore he trusted himself too openly in sight, the expectations of the\r\ntwo adventurers were kept constantly on the stretch, as neither could\r\nforetell what the next turning of a point might reveal. Their progress\r\nwas swift, the gigantic strength of Hurry enabling him to play with the\r\nlight bark as if it had been a feather, while the skill of his companion\r\nalmost equalized their usefulness, notwithstanding the disparity in\r\nnatural means.\r\n\r\nEach time the canoe passed a point, Hurry turned a look behind him,\r\nexpecting to see the "ark" anchored, or beached in the bay. He was\r\nfated to be disappointed, however; and they had got within a mile of the\r\nsouthern end of the lake, or a distance of quite two leagues from the\r\n"castle," which was now hidden from view by half a dozen intervening\r\nprojections of the land, when he suddenly ceased paddling, as if\r\nuncertain in what direction next to steer.\r\n\r\n"It is possible that the old chap has dropped into the river," said\r\nHurry, after looking carefully along the whole of the eastern shore,\r\nwhich was about a mile distant, and open to his scrutiny for more than\r\nhalf its length; "for he has taken to trapping considerable, of late,\r\nand, barring flood-wood, he might drop down it a mile or so; though he\r\nwould have a most scratching time in getting back again!"\r\n\r\n"Where is this outlet?" asked Deerslayer; "I see no opening in the\r\nbanks or the trees, that looks as if it would let a river like the\r\nSusquehannah run through it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, Deerslayer, rivers are like human mortals; having small beginnings,\r\nand ending with broad shoulders and wide mouths. You don\'t see the\r\noutlet, because it passes atween high, steep banks; and the pines, and\r\nhemlocks and bass-woods hang over it, as a roof hangs over a house. If\r\nold Tom is not in the \'Rat\'s Cove,\' he must have burrowed in the river;\r\nwe\'ll look for him first in the cove, and then we\'ll cross to the\r\noutlet."\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded, Hurry explained that there was a shallow bay, formed\r\nby a long, low point, that had got the name of the "Rat\'s Cove," from\r\nthe circumstance of its being a favorite haunt of the muskrat; and which\r\noffered so complete a cover for the "ark," that its owner was fond of\r\nlying in it, whenever he found it convenient.\r\n\r\n"As a man never knows who may be his visitors, in this part of the\r\ncountry," continued Hurry, "it\'s a great advantage to get a good look\r\nat \'em afore they come too near. Now it\'s war, such caution is more than\r\ncommonly useful, since a Canada man or a Mingo might get into his hut\r\nafore he invited \'em. But Hutter is a first-rate look-outer, and can\r\npretty much scent danger, as a hound scents the deer."\r\n\r\n"I should think the castle so open, that it would be sartain to draw\r\ninimies, if any happened to find the lake; a thing onlikely enough, I\r\nwill allow, as it\'s off the trail of the forts and settlements."\r\n\r\n"Why, Deerslayer, I\'ve got to believe that a man meets with inimies\r\neasier than he meets with fri\'nds. It\'s skearful to think for how many\r\ncauses one gets to be your inimy, and for how few your fri\'nd. Some take\r\nup the hatchet because you don\'t think just as they think; other some\r\nbecause you run ahead of \'em in the same idees; and I once know\'d a\r\nvagabond that quarrelled with a fri\'nd because he didn\'t think him\r\nhandsome. Now, you\'re no monument in the way of beauty, yourself,\r\nDeerslayer, and yet you wouldn\'t be so onreasonable as to become my\r\ninimy for just saying so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m as the Lord made me; and I wish to be accounted no better, nor any\r\nworse. Good looks I may not have; that is to say, to a degree that the\r\nlight-minded and vain crave; but I hope I\'m not altogether without some\r\nricommend in the way of good conduct. There\'s few nobler looking men to\r\nbe seen than yourself, Hurry; and I know that I am not to expect any to\r\nturn their eyes on me, when such a one as you can be gazed on; but I\r\ndo not know that a hunter is less expart with the rifle, or less to be\r\nrelied on for food, because he doesn\'t wish to stop at every shining\r\nspring he may meet, to study his own countenance in the water."\r\n\r\nHere Hurry burst into a fit of loud laughter; for while he was too\r\nreckless to care much about his own manifest physical superiority, he\r\nwas well aware of it, and, like most men who derive an advantage from\r\nthe accidents of birth or nature, he was apt to think complacently on\r\nthe subject, whenever it happened to cross his mind.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Deerslayer, you\'re no beauty, as you will own yourself, if\r\nyou\'ll look over the side of the canoe," he cried; "Jude will say that\r\nto your face, if you start her, for a tarter tongue isn\'t to be found in\r\nany gal\'s head, in or out of the settlements, if you provoke her to use\r\nit. My advice to you is, never to aggravate Judith; though you may tell\r\nanything to Hetty, and she\'ll take it as meek as a lamb. No, Jude will\r\nbe just as like as not to tell you her opinion consarning your looks."\r\n\r\n"And if she does, Hurry, she will tell me no more than you have said\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not thick\'ning up about a small remark, I hope, Deerslayer,\r\nwhen no harm is meant. You are not a beauty, as you must know, and\r\nwhy shouldn\'t fri\'nds tell each other these little trifles? If you was\r\nhandsome, or ever like to be, I\'d be one of the first to tell you of it;\r\nand that ought to content you. Now, if Jude was to tell me that I\'m as\r\nugly as a sinner, I\'d take it as a sort of obligation, and try not to\r\nbelieve her."\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy for them that natur\' has favored, to jest about such matters,\r\nHurry, though it is sometimes hard for others. I\'ll not deny but I\'ve\r\nhad my cravings towards good looks; yes, I have; but then I\'ve always\r\nbeen able to get them down by considering how many I\'ve known with fair\r\noutsides, who have had nothing to boast of inwardly. I\'ll not deny,\r\nHurry, that I often wish I\'d been created more comely to the eye, and\r\nmore like such a one as yourself in them particulars; but then I get the\r\nfeelin\' under by remembering how much better off I am, in a great many\r\nrespects, than some fellow-mortals. I might have been born lame, and\r\nonfit even for a squirrel-hunt, or blind, which would have made me a\r\nburden on myself as well as on my fri\'nds; or without hearing, which\r\nwould have totally onqualified me for ever campaigning or scouting;\r\nwhich I look forward to as part of a man\'s duty in troublesome times.\r\nYes, yes; it\'s not pleasant, I will allow, to see them that\'s more\r\ncomely, and more sought a\'ter, and honored than yourself; but it may\r\nall be borne, if a man looks the evil in the face, and don\'t mistake his\r\ngifts and his obligations."\r\n\r\nHurry, in the main, was a good-hearted as well as good-natured fellow;\r\nand the self-abasement of his companion completely got the better of\r\nthe passing feeling of personal vanity. He regretted the allusion he\r\nhad made to the other\'s appearance, and endeavored to express as much,\r\nthough it was done in the uncouth manner that belonged to the habits and\r\nopinions of the frontier.\r\n\r\n"I meant no harm, Deerslayer," he answered, in a deprecating manner,\r\n"and hope you\'ll forget what I\'ve said. If you\'re not downright\r\nhandsome, you\'ve a sartain look that says, plainer than any words, that\r\nall\'s right within. Then you set no value by looks, and will the sooner\r\nforgive any little slight to your appearance. I will not say that Jude\r\nwill greatly admire you, for that might raise hopes that would only\r\nbreed disapp\'intment; but there\'s Hetty, now, would be just as likely\r\nto find satisfaction in looking at you, as in looking at any other man.\r\nThen you\'re altogether too grave and considerate-like, to care much\r\nabout Judith; for, though the gal is oncommon, she is so general in her\r\nadmiration, that a man need not be exalted because she happens to smile.\r\nI sometimes think the hussy loves herself better than she does anything\r\nelse breathin\'."\r\n\r\n"If she did, Hurry, she\'d do no more, I\'m afeard, than most queens on\r\ntheir thrones, and ladies in the towns," answered Deerslayer, smiling,\r\nand turning back towards his companion with every trace of feeling\r\nbanished from his honest-looking and frank countenance. "I never yet\r\nknow\'d even a Delaware of whom you might not say that much. But here is\r\nthe end of the long p\'int you mentioned, and the \'Rat\'s Cove\' can\'t be\r\nfar off."\r\n\r\nThis point, instead of thrusting itself forward, like all the others,\r\nran in a line with the main shore of the lake, which here swept within\r\nit, in a deep and retired bay, circling round south again, at the\r\ndistance of a quarter of a mile, and crossed the valley, forming the\r\nsouthern termination of the water. In this bay Hurry felt almost certain\r\nof finding the ark, since, anchored behind the trees that covered the\r\nnarrow strip of the point, it might have lain concealed from prying eyes\r\nan entire summer. So complete, indeed, was the cover, in this spot, that\r\na boat hauled close to the beach, within the point, and near the bottom\r\nof the bay, could by any possibility be seen from only one direction;\r\nand that was from a densely wooded shore within the sweep of the water,\r\nwhere strangers would be little apt to go.\r\n\r\n"We shall soon see the ark," said Hurry, as the canoe glided round\r\nthe extremity of the point, where the water was so deep as actually to\r\nappear black; "he loves to burrow up among the rushes, and we shall be\r\nin his nest in five minutes, although the old fellow may be off among\r\nthe traps himself."\r\n\r\nMarch proved a false prophet. The canoe completely doubled the point, so\r\nas to enable the two travellers to command a view of the whole cove or\r\nbay, for it was more properly the last, and no object, but those that\r\nnature had placed there, became visible. The placid water swept round\r\nin a graceful curve, the rushes bent gently towards its surface, and\r\nthe trees overhung it as usual; but all lay in the soothing and sublime\r\nsolitude of a wilderness. The scene was such as a poet or an artist\r\nwould have delighted in, but it had no charm for Hurry Harry, who was\r\nburning with impatience to get a sight of his light-minded beauty.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the canoe had been attended with little or no noise, the\r\nfrontiermen habitually getting accustomed to caution in most of their\r\nmovements, and it now lay on the glassy water appearing to float in air,\r\npartaking of the breathing stillness that seemed to pervade the entire\r\nscene. At this instant a dry stick was heard cracking on the narrow\r\nstrip of land that concealed the bay from the open lake. Both the\r\nadventurers started, and each extended a hand towards his rifle, the\r\nweapon never being out of reach of the arm.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas too heavy for any light creatur\'," whispered Hurry, "and it\r\nsounded like the tread of a man!"\r\n\r\n"Not so--not so," returned Deerslayer; "\'t was, as you say, too heavy\r\nfor one, but it was too light for the other. Put your paddle in the\r\nwater, and send the canoe in, to that log; I\'ll land and cut off the\r\ncreatur\'s retreat up the p\'int, be it a Mingo, or be it a muskrat."\r\n\r\nAs Hurry complied, Deerslayer was soon on the shore, advancing into the\r\nthicket with a moccasined foot, and a caution that prevented the least\r\nnoise. In a minute he was in the centre of the narrow strip of land,\r\nand moving slowly down towards its end, the bushes rendering extreme\r\nwatchfulness necessary. Just as he reached the centre of the thicket\r\nthe dried twigs cracked again, and the noise was repeated at short\r\nintervals, as if some creature having life walked slowly towards the\r\npoint. Hurry heard these sounds also, and pushing the canoe off into\r\nthe bay, he seized his rifle to watch the result. A breathless minute\r\nsucceeded, after which a noble buck walked out of the thicket, proceeded\r\nwith a stately step to the sandy extremity of the point, and began to\r\nslake his thirst from the water of the lake. Hurry hesitated an instant;\r\nthen raising his rifle hastily to his shoulder, he took sight and fired.\r\nThe effect of this sudden interruption of the solemn stillness of such\r\na scene was not its least striking peculiarity. The report of the weapon\r\nhad the usual sharp, short sound of the rifle: but when a few moments\r\nof silence had succeeded the sudden crack, during which the noise was\r\nfloating in air across the water, it reached the rocks of the opposite\r\nmountain, where the vibrations accumulated, and were rolled from cavity\r\nto cavity for miles along the hills, seeming to awaken the sleeping\r\nthunders of the woods. The buck merely shook his head at the report of\r\nthe rifle and the whistling of the bullet, for never before had he come\r\nin contact with man; but the echoes of the hills awakened his distrust,\r\nand leaping forward, with his four legs drawn under his body, he fell\r\nat once into deep water, and began to swim towards the foot of the lake.\r\nHurry shouted and dashed forward in chase, and for one or two minutes\r\nthe water foamed around the pursuer and the pursued. The former was\r\ndashing past the point, when Deerslayer appeared on the sand and signed\r\nto him to return.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas inconsiderate to pull a trigger, afore we had reconn\'itred the\r\nshore, and made sartain that no inimies harbored near it," said the\r\nlatter, as his companion slowly and reluctantly complied. "This much I\r\nhave l\'arned from the Delawares, in the way of schooling and traditions,\r\neven though I\'ve never yet been on a war-path. And, moreover, venison\r\ncan hardly be called in season now, and we do not want for food. They\r\ncall me Deerslayer, I\'ll own, and perhaps I desarve the name, in the way\r\nof understanding the creatur\'s habits, as well as for some sartainty in\r\nthe aim, but they can\'t accuse me of killing an animal when there is no\r\noccasion for the meat, or the skin. I may be a slayer, it\'s true, but\r\nI\'m no slaughterer."\r\n\r\n"\'Twas an awful mistake to miss that buck!" exclaimed Hurry, doffing his\r\ncap and running his fingers through his handsome but matted curls, as\r\nif he would loosen his tangled ideas by the process. "I\'ve not done so\r\nonhandy a thing since I was fifteen."\r\n\r\n"Never lament it, as the creatur\'s death could have done neither of us\r\nany good, and might have done us harm. Them echoes are more awful in my\r\nears, than your mistake, Hurry, for they sound like the voice of natur\'\r\ncalling out ag\'in a wasteful and onthinking action."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll hear plenty of such calls, if you tarry long in this quarter of\r\nthe world, lad," returned the other laughing. "The echoes repeat pretty\r\nmuch all that is said or done on the Glimmerglass, in this calm summer\r\nweather. If a paddle falls you hear of it sometimes, ag\'in and ag\'in,\r\nas if the hills were mocking your clumsiness, and a laugh, or a whistle,\r\ncomes out of them pines, when they\'re in the humour to speak, in a way\r\nto make you believe they can r\'ally convarse."\r\n\r\n"So much the more reason for being prudent and silent. I do not think\r\nthe inimy can have found their way into these hills yet, for I don\'t\r\nknow what they are to gain by it, but all the Delawares tell me that, as\r\ncourage is a warrior\'s first vartue, so is prudence his second. One such\r\ncall from the mountains, is enough to let a whole tribe into the secret\r\nof our arrival."\r\n\r\n"If it does no other good, it will warn old Tom to put the pot over, and\r\nlet him know visiters are at hand. Come, lad; get into the canoe, and we\r\nwill hunt the ark up, while there is yet day."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer complied, and the canoe left the spot. Its head was turned\r\ndiagonally across the lake, pointing towards the south-eastern curvature\r\nof the sheet. In that direction, the distance to the shore, or to the\r\ntermination of the lake, on the course the two were now steering, was\r\nnot quite a mile, and, their progress being always swift, it was fast\r\nlessening under the skilful, but easy sweeps of the paddles. When about\r\nhalf way across, a slight noise drew the eyes of the men towards the\r\nnearest land, and they saw that the buck was just emerging from the lake\r\nand wading towards the beach. In a minute, the noble animal shook the\r\nwater from his flanks, gazed up ward at the covering of trees, and,\r\nbounding against the bank, plunged into the forest.\r\n\r\n"That creatur\' goes off with gratitude in his heart," said Deerslayer,\r\n"for natur\' tells him he has escaped a great danger. You ought to have\r\nsome of the same feelin\'s, Hurry, to think your eye wasn\'t true, or\r\nthat your hand was onsteady, when no good could come of a shot that was\r\nintended onmeaningly rather than in reason."\r\n\r\n"I deny the eye and the hand," cried March with some heat. "You\'ve got\r\na little character, down among the Delawares, there, for quickness and\r\nsartainty, at a deer, but I should like to see you behind one of them\r\npines, and a full painted Mingo behind another, each with a cock\'d rifle\r\nand a striving for the chance! Them\'s the situations, Nathaniel, to try\r\nthe sight and the hand, for they begin with trying the narves. I never\r\nlook upon killing a creatur\' as an explite; but killing a savage is. The\r\ntime will come to try your hand, now we\'ve got to blows ag\'in, and we\r\nshall soon know what a ven\'son reputation can do in the field. I deny\r\nthat either hand or eye was onsteady; it was all a miscalculation of the\r\nbuck, which stood still when he ought to have kept in motion, and so I\r\nshot ahead of him."\r\n\r\n"Have it your own way, Hurry; all I contend for is, that it\'s lucky.\r\nI dare say I shall not pull upon a human mortal as steadily or with as\r\nlight a heart, as I pull upon a deer."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s talking of mortals, or of human beings at all, Deerslayer? I put\r\nthe matter to you on the supposition of an Injin. I dare say any man\r\nwould have his feelin\'s when it got to be life or death, ag\'in another\r\nhuman mortal; but there would be no such scruples in regard to an Injin;\r\nnothing but the chance of his hitting you, or the chance of your hitting\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I look upon the redmen to be quite as human as we are ourselves, Hurry.\r\nThey have their gifts, and their religion, it\'s true; but that makes no\r\ndifference in the end, when each will be judged according to his deeds,\r\nand not according to his skin."\r\n\r\n"That\'s downright missionary, and will find little favor up in this part\r\nof the country, where the Moravians don\'t congregate. Now, skin makes\r\nthe man. This is reason; else how are people to judge of each other.\r\nThe skin is put on, over all, in order when a creatur\', or a mortal, is\r\nfairly seen, you may know at once what to make of him. You know a bear\r\nfrom a hog, by his skin, and a gray squirrel from a black."\r\n\r\n"True, Hurry," said the other looking back and smiling, "nevertheless,\r\nthey are both squirrels."\r\n\r\n"Who denies it? But you\'ll not say that a red man and a white man are\r\nboth Injins?"\r\n\r\n"But I do say they are both men. Men of different races and colors, and\r\nhaving different gifts and traditions, but, in the main, with the same\r\nnatur\'. Both have souls; and both will be held accountable for their\r\ndeeds in this life."\r\n\r\nHurry was one of those theorists who believed in the inferiority of all\r\nthe human race who were not white. His notions on the subject were\r\nnot very clear, nor were his definitions at all well settled; but his\r\nopinions were none the less dogmatical or fierce. His conscience accused\r\nhim of sundry lawless acts against the Indians, and he had found it an\r\nexceedingly easy mode of quieting it, by putting the whole family of\r\nredmen, incontinently, without the category of human rights. Nothing\r\nangered him sooner than to deny his proposition, more especially if the\r\ndenial were accompanied by a show of plausible argument; and he did not\r\nlisten to his companion\'s remarks with much composure of either manner\r\nor feeling.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a boy, Deerslayer, misled and misconsaited by Delaware arts, and\r\nmissionary ignorance," he exclaimed, with his usual indifference to the\r\nforms of speech, when excited. "You may account yourself as a red-skin\'s\r\nbrother, but I hold\'em all to be animals; with nothing human about \'em\r\nbut cunning. That they have, I\'ll allow; but so has a fox, or even a\r\nbear. I\'m older than you, and have lived longer in the woods--or, for\r\nthat matter, have lived always there, and am not to be told what an\r\nInjin is or what he is not. If you wish to be considered a savage,\r\nyou\'ve only to say so, and I\'ll name you as such to Judith and the old\r\nman, and then we\'ll see how you\'ll like your welcome."\r\n\r\nHere Hurry\'s imagination did his temper some service, since, by\r\nconjuring up the reception his semi-aquatic acquaintance would be\r\nlikely to bestow on one thus introduced, he burst into a hearty fit\r\nof laughter. Deerslayer too well knew the uselessness of attempting\r\nto convince such a being of anything against his prejudices, to feel a\r\ndesire to undertake the task; and he was not sorry that the approach of\r\nthe canoe to the southeastern curve of the lake gave a new direction to\r\nhis ideas. They were now, indeed, quite near the place that March had\r\npointed out for the position of the outlet, and both began to look for\r\nit with a curiosity that was increased by the expectation of the ark.\r\n\r\nIt may strike the reader as a little singular, that the place where a\r\nstream of any size passed through banks that had an elevation of some\r\ntwenty feet, should be a matter of doubt with men who could not now have\r\nbeen more than two hundred yards distant from the precise spot. It will\r\nbe recollected, however, that the trees and bushes here, as elsewhere,\r\nfairly overhung the water, making such a fringe to the lake, as to\r\nconceal any little variations from its general outline.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not been down at this end of the lake these two summers," said\r\nHurry, standing up in the canoe, the better to look about him. "Ay,\r\nthere\'s the rock, showing its chin above the water, and I know that the\r\nriver begins in its neighborhood."\r\n\r\nThe men now plied the paddles again, and they were presently within a\r\nfew yards of the rock, floating towards it, though their efforts were\r\nsuspended. This rock was not large, being merely some five or six feet\r\nhigh, only half of which elevation rose above the lake. The incessant\r\nwashing of the water for centuries had so rounded its summit, that it\r\nresembled a large beehive in shape, its form being more than usually\r\nregular and even. Hurry remarked, as they floated slowly past, that this\r\nrock was well known to all the Indians in that part of the country, and\r\nthat they were in the practice of using it as a mark to designate the\r\nplace of meeting, when separated by their hunts and marches.\r\n\r\n"And here is the river, Deerslayer," he continued, "though so shut in\r\nby trees and bushes as to look more like an and-bush, than the outlet of\r\nsuch a sheet as the Glimmerglass."\r\n\r\nHurry had not badly described the place, which did truly seem to be a\r\nstream lying in ambush. The high banks might have been a hundred feet\r\nasunder; but, on the western side, a small bit of low land extended so\r\nfar forward as to diminish the breadth of the stream to half that width.\r\n\r\nAs the bushes hung in the water beneath, and pines that had the stature\r\nof church-steeples rose in tall columns above, all inclining towards the\r\nlight, until their branches intermingled, the eye, at a little distance,\r\ncould not easily detect any opening in the shore, to mark the egress of\r\nthe water. In the forest above, no traces of this outlet were to be seen\r\nfrom the lake, the whole presenting the same connected and seemingly\r\ninterminable carpet of leaves. As the canoe slowly advanced, sucked in\r\nby the current, it entered beneath an arch of trees, through which the\r\nlight from the heavens struggled by casual openings, faintly relieving\r\nthe gloom beneath.\r\n\r\n"This is a nat\'ral and-bush," half whispered Hurry, as if he felt that\r\nthe place was devoted to secrecy and watchfulness; "depend on it, old\r\nTom has burrowed with the ark somewhere in this quarter. We will drop\r\ndown with the current a short distance, and ferret him out."\r\n\r\n"This seems no place for a vessel of any size," returned the other; "it\r\nappears to me that we shall have hardly room enough for the canoe."\r\n\r\nHurry laughed at the suggestion, and, as it soon appeared, with reason;\r\nfor the fringe of bushes immediately on the shore of the lake was no\r\nsooner passed, than the adventurers found themselves in a narrow stream,\r\nof a sufficient depth of limpid water, with a strong current, and a\r\ncanopy of leaves upheld by arches composed of the limbs of hoary trees.\r\nBushes lined the shores, as usual, but they left sufficient space\r\nbetween them to admit the passage of anything that did not exceed twenty\r\nfeet in width, and to allow of a perspective ahead of eight or ten times\r\nthat distance.\r\n\r\nNeither of our two adventurers used his paddle, except to keep the light\r\nbark in the centre of the current, but both watched each turning of the\r\nstream, of which there were two or three within the first hundred yards,\r\nwith jealous vigilance. Turn after turn, however, was passed, and the\r\ncanoe had dropped down with the current some little distance, when Hurry\r\ncaught a bush, and arrested its movement so suddenly and silently as to\r\ndenote some unusual motive for the act. Deerslayer laid his hand on the\r\nstock of his rifle as soon as he noted this proceeding, but it was quite\r\nas much with a hunter\'s habit as from any feeling of alarm.\r\n\r\n"There the old fellow is!" whispered Hurry, pointing with a finger, and\r\nlaughing heartily, though he carefully avoided making a noise, "ratting\r\nit away, just as I supposed; up to his knees in the mud and water,\r\nlooking to the traps and the bait. But for the life of me I can see\r\nnothing of the ark; though I\'ll bet every skin I take this season, Jude\r\nisn\'t trusting her pretty little feet in the neighborhood of that black\r\nmud. The gal\'s more likely to be braiding her hair by the side of some\r\nspring, where she can see her own good looks, and collect scornful\r\nfeelings ag\'in us men."\r\n\r\n"You over-judge young women--yes, you do, Hurry--who as often bethink\r\nthem of their failings as they do of their perfections. I dare to say\r\nthis Judith, now, is no such admirer of herself, and no such scorner\r\nof our sex as you seem to think; and that she is quite as likely to be\r\nsarving her father in the house, wherever that may be, as he is to be\r\nsarving her among the traps."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pleasure to hear truth from a man\'s tongue, if it be only once\r\nin a girl\'s life," cried a pleasant, rich, and yet soft female voice, so\r\nnear the canoe as to make both the listeners start. "As for you, Master\r\nHurry, fair words are so apt to choke you, that I no longer expect to\r\nhear them from your mouth; the last you uttered sticking in your throat,\r\nand coming near to death. But I\'m glad to see you keep better society\r\nthan formerly, and that they who know how to esteem and treat women are\r\nnot ashamed to journey in your company."\r\n\r\nAs this was said, a singularly handsome and youthful female face was\r\nthrust through an opening in the leaves, within reach of Deerslayer\'s\r\npaddle. Its owner smiled graciously on the young man; and the frown\r\nthat she cast on Hurry, though simulated and pettish, had the effect to\r\nrender her beauty more striking, by exhibiting the play of an expressive\r\nbut capricious countenance; one that seemed to change from the soft\r\nto the severe, the mirthful to the reproving, with facility and\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nA second look explained the nature of the surprise. Unwittingly, the men\r\nhad dropped alongside of the ark, which had been purposely concealed in\r\nbushes cut and arranged for the purpose; and Judith Hutter had merely\r\npushed aside the leaves that lay before a window, in order to show her\r\nface, and speak to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "And that timid fawn starts not with fear,\r\n    When I steal to her secret bower;\r\n    And that young May violet to me is dear,\r\n    And I visit the silent streamlet near,\r\n    To look on the lovely flower."\r\n\r\n    Bryant, "An Indian Story," ii.11-15\r\n\r\nThe ark, as the floating habitation of the Hutters was generally called,\r\nwas a very simple contrivance. A large flat, or scow, composed the\r\nbuoyant part of the vessel; and in its centre, occupying the whole of\r\nits breadth, and about two thirds of its length, stood a low fabric,\r\nresembling the castle in construction, though made of materials so light\r\nas barely to be bullet-proof. As the sides of the scow were a little\r\nhigher than usual, and the interior of the cabin had no more elevation\r\nthan was necessary for comfort, this unusual addition had neither a very\r\nclumsy nor a very obtrusive appearance. It was, in short, little more\r\nthan a modern canal-boat, though more rudely constructed, of greater\r\nbreadth than common, and bearing about it the signs of the wilderness,\r\nin its bark-covered posts and roof. The scow, however, had been put\r\ntogether with some skill, being comparatively light, for its strength,\r\nand sufficiently manageable. The cabin was divided into two apartments,\r\none of which served for a parlor, and the sleeping-room of the father,\r\nand the other was appropriated to the uses of the daughters. A very\r\nsimple arrangement sufficed for the kitchen, which was in one end of\r\nthe scow, and removed from the cabin, standing in the open air; the ark\r\nbeing altogether a summer habitation.\r\n\r\nThe "and-bush," as Hurry in his ignorance of English termed it, is quite\r\nas easily explained. In many parts of the lake and river, where the\r\nbanks were steep and high, the smaller trees and larger bushes, as has\r\nbeen already mentioned, fairly overhung the stream, their branches not\r\nunfrequently dipping into the water. In some instances they grew out\r\nin nearly horizontal lines, for thirty or forty feet. The water being\r\nuniformly deepest near the shores, where the banks were highest and the\r\nnearest to a perpendicular, Hutter had found no difficulty in letting\r\nthe ark drop under one of these covers, where it had been anchored\r\nwith a view to conceal its position; security requiring some such\r\nprecautions, in his view of the case. Once beneath the trees and bushes,\r\na few stones fastened to the ends of the branches had caused them to\r\nbend sufficiently to dip into the river; and a few severed bushes,\r\nproperly disposed, did the rest. The reader has seen that this cover was\r\nso complete as to deceive two men accustomed to the woods, and who were\r\nactually in search of those it concealed; a circumstance that will be\r\neasily understood by those who are familiar with the matted and wild\r\nluxuriance of a virgin American forest, more especially in a rich soil.\r\nThe discovery of the ark produced very different effects on our two\r\nadventurers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the canoe could be got round to the proper opening, Hurry\r\nleaped on board, and in a minute was closely engaged in a gay, and a\r\nsort of recriminating discourse with Judith, apparently forgetful of\r\nthe existence of all the rest of the world. Not so with Deerslayer. He\r\nentered the ark with a slow, cautious step, examining every arrangement\r\nof the cover with curious and scrutinizing eyes. It is true, he cast\r\none admiring glance at Judith, which was extorted by her brilliant and\r\nsingular beauty; but even this could detain him but a single instant\r\nfrom the indulgence of his interest in Hutter\'s contrivances. Step\r\nby step did he look into the construction of the singular abode,\r\ninvestigate its fastenings and strength, ascertain its means of defence,\r\nand make every inquiry that would be likely to occur to one whose\r\nthoughts dwelt principally on such expedients. Nor was the cover\r\nneglected. Of this he examined the whole minutely, his commendation\r\nescaping him more than once in audible comments. Frontier usages\r\nadmitting of this familiarity, he passed through the rooms, as he had\r\npreviously done at the \'Castle\', and opening a door issued into the end\r\nof the scow opposite to that where he had left Hurry and Judith. Here\r\nhe found the other sister, employed at some coarse needle-work, seated\r\nbeneath the leafy canopy of the cover.\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer\'s examination was by this time ended, he dropped the butt\r\nof his rifle, and, leaning on the barrel with both hands, he turned\r\ntowards the girl with an interest the singular beauty of her sister\r\nhad not awakened. He had gathered from Hurry\'s remarks that Hetty was\r\nconsidered to have less intellect than ordinarily falls to the share of\r\nhuman beings, and his education among Indians had taught him to treat\r\nthose who were thus afflicted by Providence with more than common\r\ntenderness. Nor was there any thing in Hetty Hutter\'s appearance, as so\r\noften happens, to weaken the interest her situation excited. An idiot\r\nshe could not properly be termed, her mind being just enough enfeebled\r\nto lose most of those traits that are connected with the more artful\r\nqualities, and to retain its ingenuousness and love of truth. It had\r\noften been remarked of this girl, by the few who had seen her, and who\r\npossessed sufficient knowledge to discriminate, that her perception\r\nof the right seemed almost intuitive, while her aversion to the wrong\r\nformed so distinctive a feature of her mind, as to surround her with an\r\natmosphere of pure morality; peculiarities that are not infrequent with\r\npersons who are termed feeble-minded; as if God had forbidden the evil\r\nspirits to invade a precinct so defenceless, with the benign purpose\r\nof extending a direct protection to those who had been left without the\r\nusual aids of humanity. Her person, too, was agreeable, having a strong\r\nresemblance to that of her sister\'s, of which it was a subdued and\r\nhumble copy. If it had none of the brilliancy of Judith\'s, the calm,\r\nquiet, almost holy expression of her meek countenance seldom failed to\r\nwin on the observer, and few noted it long that did not begin to feel a\r\ndeep and lasting interest in the girl. She had no colour, in common,\r\nnor was her simple mind apt to present images that caused her cheek to\r\nbrighten, though she retained a modesty so innate that it almost raised\r\nher to the unsuspecting purity of a being superior to human infirmities.\r\nGuileless, innocent, and without distrust, equally by nature and from\r\nher mode of life, providence had, nevertheless shielded her from harm,\r\nby a halo of moral light, as it is said \'to temper the wind to the shorn\r\nlamb.\'\r\n\r\n"You are Hetty Hutter," said Deerslayer, in the way one puts a question\r\nunconsciously to himself, assuming a kindness of tone and manner that\r\nwere singularly adapted to win the confidence of her he addressed.\r\n"Hurry Harry has told me of you, and I know you must be the child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m Hetty Hutter" returned the girl in a low, sweet voice, which\r\nnature, aided by some education, had preserved from vulgarity of tone\r\nand utterance--"I\'m Hetty; Judith Hutter\'s sister; and Thomas Hutter\'s\r\nyoungest daughter."\r\n\r\n"I know your history, then, for Hurry Harry talks considerable, and he\r\nis free of speech when he can find other people\'s consarns to dwell on.\r\nYou pass most of your life on the lake, Hetty."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Mother is dead; father is gone a-trapping, and Judith and I\r\nstay at home. What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a question more easily asked than it is answered, young woman,\r\nseeing that I\'m so young, and yet have borne more names than some of the\r\ngreatest chiefs in all America."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got a name--you don\'t throw away one name, before you come\r\nhonestly by another?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not, gal--I hope not. My names have come nat\'rally, and I\r\nsuppose the one I bear now will be of no great lasting, since the\r\nDelawares seldom settle on a man\'s ra\'al title, until such time as he\r\nhas an opportunity of showing his true natur\', in the council, or on the\r\nwarpath; which has never behappened me; seeing firstly, because I\'m not\r\nborn a red-skin and have no right to sit in their councillings, and am\r\nmuch too humble to be called on for opinions from the great of my own\r\ncolour; and, secondly, because this is the first war that has befallen\r\nin my time, and no inimy has yet inroaded far enough into the colony, to\r\nbe reached by an arm even longer than mine."\r\n\r\n"Tell me your names," added Hetty, looking up at him artlessly, "and,\r\nmaybe, I\'ll tell you your character."\r\n\r\n"There is some truth in that, I\'ll not deny, though it often fails. Men\r\nare deceived in other men\'s characters, and frequently give \'em names\r\nthey by no means desarve. You can see the truth of this in the Mingo\r\nnames, which, in their own tongue, signify the same things as the\r\nDelaware names,--at least, so they tell me, for I know little of that\r\ntribe, unless it be by report,--and no one can say they are as honest or\r\nas upright a nation. I put no great dependence, therefore, on names."\r\n\r\n"Tell me all your names," repeated the girl, earnestly, for her mind\r\nwas too simple to separate things from professions, and she did attach\r\nimportance to a name; "I want to know what to think of you."\r\n\r\n"Well, sartain; I\'ve no objection, and you shall hear them all. In the\r\nfirst place, then, I\'m Christian, and white-born, like yourself, and my\r\nparents had a name that came down from father to son, as is a part of\r\ntheir gifts. My father was called Bumppo; and I was named after him, of\r\ncourse, the given name being Nathaniel, or Natty, as most people saw fit\r\nto tarm it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--Natty--and Hetty" interrupted the girl quickly, and\r\nlooking up from her work again, with a smile: "you are Natty, and I\'m\r\nHetty--though you are Bumppo, and I\'m Hutter. Bumppo isn\'t as pretty as\r\nHutter, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s as people fancy. Bumppo has no lofty sound, I admit; and\r\nyet men have bumped through the world with it. I did not go by this\r\nname, howsoever, very long; for the Delawares soon found out, or thought\r\nthey found out, that I was not given to lying, and they called me,\r\nfirstly, \'Straight-tongue.\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good name," interrupted Hetty, earnestly, and in a positive\r\nmanner; "don\'t tell me there\'s no virtue in names!"\r\n\r\n"I do not say that, for perhaps I desarved to be so called, lies being\r\nno favorites with me, as they are with some. After a while they found\r\nout I was quick of foot, and then they called me \'The Pigeon\'; which,\r\nyou know, has a swift wing, and flies in a straight line."\r\n\r\n"That was a pretty name!" exclaimed Hetty; "pigeons are pretty birds!"\r\n\r\n"Most things that God created are pretty in their way, my good gal,\r\nthough they get to be deformed by mankind, so as to change their\r\nnatur\'s, as well as their appearance. From carrying messages, and\r\nstriking blind trails, I got at last to following the hunters, when it\r\nwas thought I was quicker and surer at finding the game than most lads,\r\nand then they called me the \'Lap-ear\'; as, they said, I partook of the\r\nsagacity of the hound."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not so pretty," answered Hetty; "I hope you didn\'t keep that\r\nname long."\r\n\r\n"Not after I was rich enough to buy a rifle," returned the other,\r\nbetraying a little pride through his usually quiet and subdued manner;\r\n"then it was seen I could keep a wigwam in ven\'son; and in time I got\r\nthe name of \'Deerslayer,\' which is that I now bear; homely as some will\r\nthink it, who set more value on the scalp of a fellow-mortal than on the\r\nhorns of a buck."\r\n\r\n"Well, Deerslayer, I\'m not one of them," answered Hetty, simply; "Judith\r\nlikes soldiers, and flary coats, and fine feathers; but they\'re all\r\nnaught to me. She says the officers are great, and gay, and of soft\r\nspeech; but they make me shudder, for their business is to kill their\r\nfellow-creatures. I like your calling better; and your last name is a\r\nvery good one--better than Natty Bumppo."\r\n\r\n"This is nat\'ral in one of your turn of mind, Hetty, and much as I\r\nshould have expected. They tell me your sister is handsome--oncommon,\r\nfor a mortal; and beauty is apt to seek admiration."\r\n\r\n"Did you never see Judith?" demanded the girl, with quick earnestness;\r\n"if you never have, go at once and look at her. Even Hurry Harry isn\'t\r\nmore pleasant to look at though she is a woman, and he is a man."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer regarded the girl for a moment with concern. Her pale-face\r\nhad flushed a little, and her eye, usually so mild and serene,\r\nbrightened as she spoke, in the way to betray the inward impulses.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Hurry Harry," he muttered to himself, as he walked through the\r\ncabin towards the other end of the boat; "this comes of good looks, if\r\na light tongue has had no consarn in it. It\'s easy to see which way that\r\npoor creatur\'s feelin\'s are leanin\', whatever may be the case with your\r\nJude\'s."\r\n\r\nBut an interruption was put to the gallantry of Hurry, the coquetry\r\nof his intros, the thoughts of Deerslayer, and the gentle feelings of\r\nHetty, by the sudden appearance of the canoe of the ark\'s owner, in the\r\nnarrow opening among the bushes that served as a sort of moat to\r\nhis position. It would seem that Hutter, or Floating Tom, as he was\r\nfamiliarly called by all the hunters who knew his habits, recognized the\r\ncanoe of Hurry, for he expressed no surprise at finding him in the\r\nscow. On the contrary, his reception was such as to denote not only\r\ngratification, but a pleasure, mingled with a little disappointment at\r\nhis not having made his appearance some days sooner.\r\n\r\n"I looked for you last week," he said, in a half-grumbling,\r\nhalf-welcoming manner; "and was disappointed uncommonly that you didn\'t\r\narrive. There came a runner through, to warn all the trappers and\r\nhunters that the colony and the Canadas were again in trouble; and I\r\nfelt lonesome, up in these mountains, with three scalps to see to, and\r\nonly one pair of hands to protect them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s reasonable," returned March; "and \'t was feeling like a parent.\r\nNo doubt, if I had two such darters as Judith and Hetty, my exper\'ence\r\nwould tell the same story, though in gin\'ral I am just as well satisfied\r\nwith having the nearest neighbor fifty miles off, as when he is within\r\ncall."\r\n\r\n"Notwithstanding, you didn\'t choose to come into the wilderness alone,\r\nnow you knew that the Canada savages are likely to be stirring,"\r\nreturned Hutter, giving a sort of distrustful, and at the same time\r\ninquiring glance at Deerslayer.\r\n\r\n"Why should I? They say a bad companion, on a journey, helps to shorten\r\nthe path; and this young man I account to be a reasonably good one.\r\nThis is Deerslayer, old Tom, a noted hunter among the Delawares, and\r\nChristian-born, and Christian-edicated, too, like you and me. The lad is\r\nnot parfect, perhaps, but there\'s worse men in the country that he came\r\nfrom, and it\'s likely he\'ll find some that\'s no better, in this part\r\nof the world. Should we have occasion to defend our traps, and the\r\nterritory, he\'ll be useful in feeding us all; for he\'s a reg\'lar dealer\r\nin ven\'son."\r\n\r\n"Young man, you are welcome," growled Tom, thrusting a hard, bony hand\r\ntowards the youth, as a pledge of his sincerity; "in such times, a white\r\nface is a friend\'s, and I count on you as a support. Children sometimes\r\nmake a stout heart feeble, and these two daughters of mine give me more\r\nconcern than all my traps, and skins, and rights in the country."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nat\'ral!" cried Hurry. "Yes, Deerslayer, you and I don\'t know it\r\nyet by experience; but, on the whole, I consider that as nat\'ral. If we\r\nhad darters, it\'s more than probable we should have some such feelin\'s;\r\nand I honor the man that owns \'em. As for Judith, old man, I enlist, at\r\nonce, as her soldier, and here is Deerslayer to help you to take care of\r\nHetty."\r\n\r\n"Many thanks to you, Master March," returned the beauty, in a full, rich\r\nvoice, and with an accuracy of intonation and utterance that she shared\r\nin common with her sister, and which showed that she had been better\r\ntaught than her father\'s life and appearance would give reason to\r\nexpect. "Many thanks to you; but Judith Hutter has the spirit and\r\nthe experience that will make her depend more on herself than on\r\ngood-looking rovers like you. Should there be need to face the savages,\r\ndo you land with my father, instead of burrowing in the huts, under the\r\nshow of defending us females and--"\r\n\r\n"Girl--girl," interrupted the father, "quiet that glib tongue of thine,\r\nand hear the truth. There are savages on the lake shore already, and no\r\nman can say how near to us they may be at this very moment, or when we\r\nmay hear more from them!"\r\n\r\n"If this be true, Master Hutter," said Hurry, whose change of\r\ncountenance denoted how serious he deemed the information, though it did\r\nnot denote any unmanly alarm, "if this be true, your ark is in a most\r\nmisfortunate position, for, though the cover did deceive Deerslayer and\r\nmyself, it would hardly be overlooked by a full-blooded Injin, who was\r\nout seriously in s\'arch of scalps!"\r\n\r\n"I think as you do, Hurry, and wish, with all my heart, we lay anywhere\r\nelse, at this moment, than in this narrow, crooked stream, which has\r\nmany advantages to hide in, but which is almost fatal to them that are\r\ndiscovered. The savages are near us, moreover, and the difficulty is,\r\nto get out of the river without being shot down like deer standing at a\r\nlick!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sartain, Master Hutter, that the red-skins you dread are ra\'al\r\nCanadas?" asked Deerslayer, in a modest but earnest manner. "Have you\r\nseen any, and can you describe their paint?"\r\n\r\n"I have fallen in with the signs of their being in the neighborhood,\r\nbut have seen none of \'em. I was down stream a mile or so, looking to my\r\ntraps, when I struck a fresh trail, crossing the corner of a swamp, and\r\nmoving northward. The man had not passed an hour; and I know\'d it for an\r\nIndian footstep, by the size of the foot, and the intoe, even before I\r\nfound a worn moccasin, which its owner had dropped as useless. For that\r\nmatter, I found the spot where he halted to make a new one, which was\r\nonly a few yards from the place where he had dropped the old one."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t look much like a red-skin on the war path!" returned the\r\nother, shaking his head. "An exper\'enced warrior, at least, would have\r\nburned, or buried, or sunk in the river such signs of his passage; and\r\nyour trail is, quite likely, a peaceable trail. But the moccasin may\r\ngreatly relieve my mind, if you bethought you of bringing it off. I\'ve\r\ncome here to meet a young chief myself; and his course would be much in\r\nthe direction you\'ve mentioned. The trail may have been his\'n."\r\n\r\n"Hurry Harry, you\'re well acquainted with this young man, I hope, who\r\nhas meetings with savages in a part of the country where he has\r\nnever been before?" demanded Hutter, in a tone and in a manner that\r\nsufficiently indicated the motive of the question; these rude beings\r\nseldom hesitating, on the score of delicacy, to betray their feelings.\r\n"Treachery is an Indian virtue; and the whites, that live much in their\r\ntribes, soon catch their ways and practices."\r\n\r\n"True--true as the Gospel, old Tom; but not personable to Deerslayer,\r\nwho\'s a young man of truth, if he has no other ricommend. I\'ll answer\r\nfor his honesty, whatever I may do for his valor in battle."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know his errand in this strange quarter of the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"That is soon told, Master Hutter," said the young man, with the\r\ncomposure of one who kept a clean conscience. "I think, moreover, you\'ve\r\na right to ask it. The father of two such darters, who occupies a lake,\r\nafter your fashion, has just the same right to inquire into a stranger\'s\r\nbusiness in his neighborhood, as the colony would have to demand the\r\nreason why the Frenchers put more rijiments than common along the lines.\r\nNo, no, I\'ll not deny your right to know why a stranger comes into your\r\nhabitation or country, in times as serious as these."\r\n\r\n"If such is your way of thinking, friend, let me hear your story without\r\nmore words."\r\n\r\n"\'T is soon told, as I said afore; and shall be honestly told. I\'m a\r\nyoung man, and, as yet, have never been on a war-path; but no sooner did\r\nthe news come among the Delawares, that wampum and a hatchet were about\r\nto be sent in to the tribe, than they wished me to go out among the\r\npeople of my own color, and get the exact state of things for \'em. This\r\nI did, and, after delivering my talk to the chiefs, on my return, I met\r\nan officer of the crown on the Schoharie, who had messages to send to\r\nsome of the fri\'ndly tribes that live farther west. This was thought a\r\ngood occasion for Chingachgook, a young chief who has never struck a\r\nfoe, and myself; to go on our first war path in company, and an\r\napp\'intment was made for us, by an old Delaware, to meet at the rock\r\nnear the foot of this lake. I\'ll not deny that Chingachgook has another\r\nobject in view, but it has no consarn with any here, and is his secret\r\nand not mine; therefore I\'ll say no more about it."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis something about a young woman," interrupted Judith hastily, then\r\nlaughing at her own impetuosity, and even having the grace to colour a\r\nlittle, at the manner in which she had betrayed her readiness to impute\r\nsuch a motive. "If \'tis neither war, nor a hunt, it must be love."\r\n\r\n"Ay, it comes easy for the young and handsome, who hear so much of them\r\nfeelin\'s, to suppose that they lie at the bottom of most proceedin\'s;\r\nbut, on that head, I say nothin\'. Chingachgook is to meet me at the\r\nrock, an hour afore sunset to-morrow evening, after which we shall go our\r\nway together, molesting none but the king\'s inimies, who are lawfully\r\nour own. Knowing Hurry of old, who once trapped in our hunting grounds,\r\nand falling in with him on the Schoharie, just as he was on the p\'int of\r\nstarting for his summer ha\'nts, we agreed to journey in company; not so\r\nmuch from fear of the Mingos, as from good fellowship, and, as he says,\r\nto shorten a long road."\r\n\r\n"And you think the trail I saw may have been that of your friend, ahead\r\nof his time?" said Hutter.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my idee, which may be wrong, but which may be right. If I saw\r\nthe moccasin, howsever, I could tell, in a minute, whether it is made in\r\nthe Delaware fashion, or not."\r\n\r\n"Here it is, then," said the quick-witted Judith, who had already gone\r\nto the canoe in quest of it. "Tell us what it says; friend or enemy. You\r\nlook honest, and I believe all you say, whatever father may think."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way with you, Jude; forever finding out friends, where I\r\ndistrust foes," grumbled Tom: "but, speak out, young man, and tell us\r\nwhat you think of the moccasin."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not Delaware made," returned Deerslayer, examining the worn and\r\nrejected covering for the foot with a cautious eye. "I\'m too young on a\r\nwar-path to be positive, but I should say that moccasin has a northern\r\nlook, and comes from beyond the Great Lakes."\r\n\r\n"If such is the case, we ought not to lie here a minute longer than is\r\nnecessary," said Hutter, glancing through the leaves of his cover, as if\r\nhe already distrusted the presence of an enemy on the opposite shore of\r\nthe narrow and sinuous stream. "It wants but an hour or so of night,\r\nand to move in the dark will be impossible, without making a noise that\r\nwould betray us. Did you hear the echo of a piece in the mountains,\r\nhalf-an-hour since?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, old man, and heard the piece itself," answered Hurry, who now felt\r\nthe indiscretion of which he had been guilty, "for the last was fired\r\nfrom my own shoulder."\r\n\r\n"I feared it came from the French Indians; still it may put them on the\r\nlook-out, and be a means of discovering us. You did wrong to fire in\r\nwar-time, unless there was good occasion.\r\n\r\n"So I begin to think myself, Uncle Tom; and yet, if a man can\'t trust\r\nhimself to let off his rifle in a wilderness that is a thousand miles\r\nsquare, lest some inimy should hear it, where\'s the use in carrying\r\none?"\r\n\r\nHutter now held a long consultation with his two guests, in which the\r\nparties came to a true understanding of their situation. He explained\r\nthe difficulty that would exist in attempting to get the ark out of\r\nso swift and narrow a stream, in the dark, without making a noise that\r\ncould not fail to attract Indian ears. Any strollers in their vicinity\r\nwould keep near the river or the lake; but the former had swampy shores\r\nin many places, and was both so crooked and so fringed with bushes, that\r\nit was quite possible to move by daylight without incurring much danger\r\nof being seen. More was to be apprehended, perhaps, from the ear than\r\nfrom the eye, especially as long as they were in the short, straitened,\r\nand canopied reaches of the stream.\r\n\r\n"I never drop down into this cover, which is handy to my traps, and\r\nsafer than the lake from curious eyes, without providing the means of\r\ngetting out ag\'in," continued this singular being; "and that is easier\r\ndone by a pull than a push. My anchor is now lying above the suction, in\r\nthe open lake; and here is a line, you see, to haul us up to it. Without\r\nsome such help, a single pair of hands would make heavy work in forcing\r\na scow like this up stream. I have a sort of a crab, too, that lightens\r\nthe pull, on occasion. Jude can use the oar astern as well as myself;\r\nand when we fear no enemy, to get out of the river gives us but little\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"What should we gain, Master Hutter, by changing the position?" asked\r\nDeerslayer, with a good deal of earnestness; "this is a safe cover, and\r\na stout defence might be made from the inside of this cabin. I\'ve never\r\nfou\'t unless in the way of tradition; but it seems to me we might beat\r\noff twenty Mingos, with palisades like them afore us."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay; you \'ve never fought except in traditions, that\'s plain enough,\r\nyoung man! Did you ever see as broad a sheet of water as this above us,\r\nbefore you came in upon it with Hurry?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I ever did," Deerslayer answered, modestly. "Youth\r\nis the time to l\'arn; and I\'m far from wishing to raise my voice in\r\ncounsel, afore it is justified by exper\'ence."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll teach you the disadvantage of fighting in this\r\nposition, and the advantage of taking to the open lake. Here, you may\r\nsee, the savages will know where to aim every shot; and it would be too\r\nmuch to hope that some would not find their way through the crevices of\r\nthe logs. Now, on the other hand, we should have nothing but a forest\r\nto aim at. Then we are not safe from fire, here, the bark of this roof\r\nbeing little better than so much kindling-wood. The castle, too, might\r\nbe entered and ransacked in my absence, and all my possessions overrun\r\nand destroyed. Once in the lake, we can be attacked only in boats or\r\non rafts--shall have a fair chance with the enemy--and can protect the\r\ncastle with the ark. Do you understand this reasoning, youngster?"\r\n\r\n"It sounds well--yes, it has a rational sound; and I\'ll not gainsay it."\r\n\r\n"Well, old Tom," cried Hurry, "If we are to move, the sooner we make a\r\nbeginning, the sooner we shall know whether we are to have our scalps\r\nfor night-caps, or not."\r\n\r\nAs this proposition was self-evident, no one denied its justice. The\r\nthree men, after a short preliminary explanation, now set about their\r\npreparations to move the ark in earnest. The slight fastenings were\r\nquickly loosened; and, by hauling on the line, the heavy craft slowly\r\nemerged from the cover. It was no sooner free from the incumbrance of\r\nthe branches, than it swung into the stream, sheering quite close to the\r\nwestern shore, by the force of the current. Not a soul on board heard\r\nthe rustling of the branches, as the cabin came against the bushes and\r\ntrees of the western bank, without a feeling of uneasiness; for no one\r\nknew at what moment, or in what place, a secret and murderous enemy\r\nmight unmask himself. Perhaps the gloomy light that still struggled\r\nthrough the impending canopy of leaves, or found its way through the\r\nnarrow, ribbon-like opening, which seemed to mark, in the air above,\r\nthe course of the river that flowed beneath, aided in augmenting the\r\nappearance of the danger; for it was little more than sufficient to\r\nrender objects visible, without giving up all their outlines at a\r\nglance. Although the sun had not absolutely set, it had withdrawn its\r\ndirect rays from the valley; and the hues of evening were beginning to\r\ngather around objects that stood uncovered, rendering those within the\r\nshadows of the woods still more sombre and gloomy.\r\n\r\nNo interruption followed the movement, however, and, as the men\r\ncontinued to haul on the line, the ark passed steadily ahead, the great\r\nbreadth of the scow preventing its sinking into the water, and from\r\noffering much resistance to the progress of the swift element beneath\r\nits bottom. Hutter, too, had adopted a precaution suggested by\r\nexperience, which might have done credit to a seaman, and which\r\ncompletely prevented any of the annoyances and obstacles which otherwise\r\nwould have attended the short turns of the river. As the ark descended,\r\nheavy stones, attached to the line, were dropped in the centre of the\r\nstream, forming local anchors, each of which was kept from dragging\r\nby the assistance of those above it, until the uppermost of all was\r\nreached, which got its "backing" from the anchor, or grapnel, that lay\r\nwell out in the lake. In consequence of this expedient, the ark floated\r\nclear of the incumbrances of the shore, against which it would otherwise\r\nhave been unavoidably hauled at every turn, producing embarrassments\r\nthat Hutter, single-handed, would have found it very difficult to\r\novercome. Favored by this foresight, and stimulated by the apprehension\r\nof discovery, Floating Tom and his two athletic companions hauled the\r\nark ahead with quite as much rapidity as comported with the strength\r\nof the line. At every turn in the stream, a stone was raised from the\r\nbottom, when the direction of the scow changed to one that pointed\r\ntowards the stone that lay above. In this manner, with the channel\r\nbuoyed out for him, as a sailor might term it, did Hutter move forward,\r\noccasionally urging his friends, in a low and guarded voice, to increase\r\ntheir exertions, and then, as occasions offered, warning them against\r\nefforts that might, at particular moments, endanger all by too much\r\nzeal. In spite of their long familiarity with the woods, the gloomy\r\ncharacter of the shaded river added to the uneasiness that each felt;\r\nand when the ark reached the first bend in the Susquehannah, and the eye\r\ncaught a glimpse of the broader expanse of the lake, all felt a relief,\r\nthat perhaps none would have been willing to confess. Here the last\r\nstone was raised from the bottom, and the line led directly towards the\r\ngrapnel, which, as Hutter had explained, was dropped above the suction\r\nof the current.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" ejaculated Hurry, "there is daylight, and we shall soon\r\nhave a chance of seeing our inimies, if we are to feel \'em."\r\n\r\n"That is more than you or any man can say," growled Hutter. "There is no\r\nspot so likely to harbor a party as the shore around the outlet, and the\r\nmoment we clear these trees and get into open water, will be the most\r\ntrying time, since it will leave the enemy a cover, while it puts us\r\nout of one. Judith, girl, do you and Hetty leave the oar to take care of\r\nitself; and go within the cabin; and be mindful not to show your faces\r\nat a window; for they who will look at them won\'t stop to praise their\r\nbeauty. And now, Hurry, we\'ll step into this outer room ourselves, and\r\nhaul through the door, where we shall all be safe, from a surprise, at\r\nleast. Friend Deerslayer, as the current is lighter, and the line has\r\nall the strain on it that is prudent, do you keep moving from window to\r\nwindow, taking care not to let your head be seen, if you set any value\r\non life. No one knows when or where we shall hear from our neighbors."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer complied, with a sensation that had nothing in common with\r\nfear, but which had all the interest of a perfectly novel and a most\r\nexciting situation. For the first time in his life he was in the\r\nvicinity of enemies, or had good reason to think so; and that, too,\r\nunder all the thrilling circumstances of Indian surprises and Indian\r\nartifices. As he took his stand at the window, the ark was just passing\r\nthrough the narrowest part of the stream, a point where the water first\r\nentered what was properly termed the river, and where the trees fairly\r\ninterlocked overhead, causing the current to rush into an arch of\r\nverdure; a feature as appropriate and peculiar to the country, perhaps,\r\nas that of Switzerland, where the rivers come rushing literally from\r\nchambers of ice.\r\n\r\nThe ark was in the act of passing the last curve of this leafy entrance,\r\nas Deerslayer, having examined all that could be seen of the eastern\r\nbank of the river, crossed the room to look from the opposite window, at\r\nthe western. His arrival at this aperture was most opportune, for he\r\nhad no sooner placed his eye at a crack, than a sight met his gaze that\r\nmight well have alarmed a sentinel so young and inexperienced. A sapling\r\noverhung the water, in nearly half a circle, having first grown towards\r\nthe light, and then been pressed down into this form by the weight of\r\nthe snows; a circumstance of common occurrence in the American woods.\r\nOn this no less than six Indians had already appeared, others standing\r\nready to follow them, as they left room; each evidently bent on running\r\nout on the trunk, and dropping on the roof of the ark as it passed\r\nbeneath. This would have been an exploit of no great difficulty, the\r\ninclination of the tree admitting of an easy passage, the adjoining\r\nbranches offering ample support for the hands, and the fall being too\r\ntrifling to be apprehended. When Deerslayer first saw this party, it was\r\njust unmasking itself, by ascending the part of the tree nearest to the\r\nearth, or that which was much the most difficult to overcome; and his\r\nknowledge of Indian habits told him at once that they were all in their\r\nwar-paint, and belonged to a hostile tribe.\r\n\r\n"Pull, Hurry," he cried; "pull for your life, and as you love Judith\r\nHutter! Pull, man, pull!"\r\n\r\nThis call was made to one that the young man knew had the strength of a\r\ngiant. It was so earnest and solemn, that both Hutter and March felt\r\nit was not idly given, and they applied all their force to the line\r\nsimultaneously, and at a most critical moment. The scow redoubled its\r\nmotion, and seemed to glide from under the tree as if conscious of\r\nthe danger that was impending overhead. Perceiving that they were\r\ndiscovered, the Indians uttered the fearful war-whoop, and running\r\nforward on the tree, leaped desperately towards their fancied prize.\r\nThere were six on the tree, and each made the effort. All but their\r\nleader fell into the river more or less distant from the ark, as they\r\ncame, sooner or later, to the leaping place. The chief, who had taken\r\nthe dangerous post in advance, having an earlier opportunity than the\r\nothers, struck the scow just within the stern. The fall proving so much\r\ngreater than he had anticipated, he was slightly stunned, and for a\r\nmoment he remained half bent and unconscious of his situation. At this\r\ninstant Judith rushed from the cabin, her beauty heightened by the\r\nexcitement that produced the bold act, which flushed her cheek to\r\ncrimson, and, throwing all her strength into the effort, she pushed\r\nthe intruder over the edge of the scow, headlong into the river. This\r\ndecided feat was no sooner accomplished than the woman resumed her sway;\r\nJudith looked over the stern to ascertain what had become of the man,\r\nand the expression of her eyes softened to concern, next, her cheek\r\ncrimsoned between shame and surprise at her own temerity, and then she\r\nlaughed in her own merry and sweet manner. All this occupied less than a\r\nminute, when the arm of Deerslayer was thrown around her waist, and she\r\nwas dragged swiftly within the protection of the cabin. This retreat was\r\nnot effected too soon. Scarcely were the two in safety, when the forest\r\nwas filled with yells, and bullets began to patter against the logs.\r\n\r\nThe ark being in swift motion all this while, it was beyond the danger\r\nof pursuit by the time these little events had occurred; and the\r\nsavages, as soon as the first burst of their anger had subsided, ceased\r\nfiring, with the consciousness that they were expending their ammunition\r\nin vain. When the scow came up over her grapnel, Hutter tripped the\r\nlatter in a way not to impede the motion; and being now beyond the\r\ninfluence of the current, the vessel continued to drift ahead, until\r\nfairly in the open lake, though still near enough to the land to render\r\nexposure to a rifle-bullet dangerous. Hutter and March got out two small\r\nsweeps and, covered by the cabin, they soon urged the ark far enough\r\nfrom the shore to leave no inducement to their enemies to make any\r\nfurther attempt to injure them.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Why, let the strucken deer go weep,\r\n    The hart ungalled play,\r\n    For some must watch, while some must sleep,\r\n    Thus runs the world away."\r\n\r\n    Hamlet, III.ii.271-74\r\n\r\nAnother consultation took place in the forward part of the scow,\r\nat which both Judith and Hetty were present. As no danger could now\r\napproach unseen, immediate uneasiness had given place to the concern\r\nwhich attended the conviction that enemies were in considerable force on\r\nthe shores of the lake, and that they might be sure no practicable means\r\nof accomplishing their own destruction would be neglected. As a matter\r\nof course Hutter felt these truths the deepest, his daughters having an\r\nhabitual reliance on his resources, and knowing too little to appreciate\r\nfully all the risks they ran; while his male companions were at liberty\r\nto quit him at any moment they saw fit. His first remark showed that\r\nhe had an eye to the latter circumstance, and might have betrayed, to a\r\nkeen observer, the apprehension that was just then uppermost.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve a great advantage over the Iroquois, or the enemy, whoever they\r\nare, in being afloat," he said.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not a canoe on the lake that I don\'t know where it\'s hid; and\r\nnow yours is here. Hurry, there are but three more on the land, and\r\nthey\'re so snug in hollow logs that I don\'t believe the Indians could\r\nfind them, let them try ever so long."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no telling that--no one can say that," put in Deerslayer; "a\r\nhound is not more sartain on the scent than a red-skin, when he expects\r\nto get anything by it. Let this party see scalps afore \'em, or plunder,\r\nor honor accordin\' to their idees of what honor is, and \'t will be a\r\ntight log that hides a canoe from their eyes."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Deerslayer," cried Harry March; "you\'re downright Gospel\r\nin this matter, and I rej\'ice that my bunch of bark is safe enough here,\r\nwithin reach of my arm. I calcilate they\'ll be at all the rest of the\r\ncanoes afore to-morrow night, if they are in ra\'al \'arnest to smoke you\r\nout, old Tom, and we may as well overhaul our paddles for a pull."\r\n\r\nHutter made no immediate reply. He looked about him in silence for quite\r\na minute, examining the sky, the lake, and the belt of forest which\r\ninclosed it, as it might be hermetically, like one consulting their\r\nsigns. Nor did he find any alarming symptoms. The boundless woods were\r\nsleeping in the deep repose of nature, the heavens were placid, but\r\nstill luminous with the light of the retreating sun, while the lake\r\nlooked more lovely and calm than it had before done that day. It was a\r\nscene altogether soothing, and of a character to lull the passions into\r\na species of holy calm. How far this effect was produced, however, on\r\nthe party in the ark, must appear in the progress of our narrative.\r\n\r\n"Judith," called out the father, when he had taken this close but short\r\nsurvey of the omens, "night is at hand; find our friends food; a long\r\nmarch gives a sharp appetite."\r\n\r\n"We\'re not starving, Master Hutter," March observed, "for we filled up\r\njust as we reached the lake, and for one, I prefer the company of Jude\r\neven to her supper. This quiet evening is very agreeable to sit by her\r\nside."\r\n\r\n"Natur\' is natur\'," objected Hutter, "and must be fed. Judith, see to\r\nthe meal, and take your sister to help you. I\'ve a little discourse to\r\nhold with you, friends," he continued, as soon as his daughters were out\r\nof hearing, "and wish the girls away. You see my situation, and I should\r\nlike to hear your opinions concerning what is best to be done. Three\r\ntimes have I been burnt out already, but that was on the shore; and I\'ve\r\nconsidered myself as pretty safe ever since I got the castle built,\r\nand the ark afloat. My other accidents, however, happened in peaceable\r\ntimes, being nothing more than such flurries as a man must meet with, in\r\nthe woods; but this matter looks serious, and your ideas would greatly\r\nrelieve my mind."\r\n\r\n"It\'s my notion, old Tom, that you, and your huts, and your traps, and\r\nyour whole possessions, hereaway, are in desperate jippardy," returned\r\nthe matter-of-fact Hurry, who saw no use in concealment. "Accordin\' to\r\nmy idees of valie, they\'re altogether not worth half as much to-day as\r\nthey was yesterday, nor would I give more for \'em, taking the pay in\r\nskins."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ve children!" continued the father, making the allusion in a\r\nway that it might have puzzled even an indifferent observer to say\r\nwas intended as a bait, or as an exclamation of paternal concern,\r\n"daughters, as you know, Hurry, and good girls too, I may say, though I\r\nam their father."\r\n\r\n"A man may say anything, Master Hutter, particularly when pressed by\r\ntime and circumstances. You\'ve darters, as you say, and one of them\r\nhasn\'t her equal on the frontiers for good looks, whatever she may have\r\nfor good behavior. As for poor Hetty, she\'s Hetty Hutter, and that\'s as\r\nmuch as one can say about the poor thing. Give me Jude, if her conduct\r\nwas only equal to her looks!"\r\n\r\n"I see, Harry March, I can only count on you as a fair-weather friend;\r\nand I suppose that your companion will be of the same way of thinking,"\r\nreturned the other, with a slight show of pride, that was not altogether\r\nwithout dignity; "well, I must depend on Providence, which will not turn\r\na deaf ear, perhaps, to a father\'s prayers."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve understood Hurry, here, to mean that he intends to desart\r\nyou," said Deerslayer, with an earnest simplicity that gave double\r\nassurance of its truth, "I think you do him injustice, as I know you\r\ndo me, in supposing I would follow him, was he so ontrue-hearted as to\r\nleave a family of his own color in such a strait as this. I\'ve come on\r\nthis at take, Master Hutter, to rende\'vous a fri\'nd, and I only wish he\r\nwas here himself, as I make no doubt he will be at sunset to-morrow, when\r\nyou\'d have another rifle to aid you; an inexper\'enced one, I\'ll allow,\r\nlike my own, but one that has proved true so often ag\'in the game, big\r\nand little, that I\'ll answer for its sarvice ag\'in mortals."\r\n\r\n"May I depend on you to stand by me and my daughters, then, Deerslayer?"\r\ndemanded the old man, with a father\'s anxiety in his countenance.\r\n\r\n"That may you, Floating Tom, if that\'s your name; and as a brother would\r\nstand by a sister, a husband his wife, or a suitor his sweetheart. In\r\nthis strait you may count on me, through all advarsities; and I think\r\nHurry does discredit to his natur\' and wishes, if you can\'t count on\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Not he," cried Judith, thrusting her handsome face out of the door;\r\n"his nature is hurry, as well as his name, and he\'ll hurry off, as\r\nsoon as he thinks his fine figure in danger. Neither \'old Tom,\' nor his\r\n\'gals,\' will depend much on Master March, now they know him, but you\r\nthey will rely on, Deerslayer; for your honest face and honest heart\r\ntell us that what you promise you will perform."\r\n\r\nThis was said, as much, perhaps, in affected scorn for Hurry, as in\r\nsincerity. Still, it was not said without feeling. The fine face of\r\nJudith sufficiently proved the latter circumstance; and if the conscious\r\nMarch fancied that he had never seen in it a stronger display of\r\ncontempt--a feeling in which the beauty was apt to indulge--than while\r\nshe was looking at him, it certainly seldom exhibited more of a womanly\r\nsoftness and sensibility, than when her speaking blue eyes were turned\r\non his travelling companion.\r\n\r\n"Leave us, Judith," Hutter ordered sternly, before either of the young\r\nmen could reply; "leave us; and do not return until you come with\r\nthe venison and fish. The girl has been spoilt by the flattery of the\r\nofficers, who sometimes find their way up here, Master March, and you\'ll\r\nnot think any harm of her silly words."\r\n\r\n"You never said truer syllable, old Tom," retorted Hurry, who smarted\r\nunder Judith\'s observations; "the devil-tongued youngsters of the\r\ngarrison have proved her undoing! I scarce know Jude any longer, and\r\nshall soon take to admiring her sister, who is getting to be much more\r\nto my fancy."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear this, Harry, and look upon it as a sign that you\'re\r\ncoming to your right senses. Hetty would make a much safer and more\r\nrational companion than Jude, and would be much the most likely to\r\nlisten to your suit, as the officers have, I greatly fear, unsettled her\r\nsister\'s mind."\r\n\r\n"No man needs a safer wife than Hetty," said Hurry, laughing, "though\r\nI\'ll not answer for her being of the most rational. But no matter;\r\nDeerslayer has not misconceived me, when he told you I should be found\r\nat my post. I\'ll not quit you, Uncle Tom, just now, whatever may be my\r\nfeelin\'s and intentions respecting your eldest darter."\r\n\r\nHurry had a respectable reputation for prowess among his associates,\r\nand Hutter heard this pledge with a satisfaction that was not concealed.\r\nEven the great personal strength of such an aid became of moment, in\r\nmoving the ark, as well as in the species of hand-to-hand conflicts,\r\nthat were not unfrequent in the woods; and no commander who was hard\r\npressed could feel more joy at hearing of the arrival of reinforcements,\r\nthan the borderer experienced at being told this important auxiliary\r\nwas not about to quit him. A minute before, Hutter would have been well\r\ncontent to compromise his danger, by entering into a compact to act only\r\non the defensive; but no sooner did he feel some security on this\r\npoint, than the restlessness of man induced him to think of the means of\r\ncarrying the war into the enemy\'s country.\r\n\r\n"High prices are offered for scalps on both sides," he observed, with a\r\ngrim smile, as if he felt the force of the inducement, at the very time\r\nhe wished to affect a superiority to earning money by means that the\r\nordinary feelings of those who aspire to be civilized men repudiated,\r\neven while they were adopted. "It isn\'t right, perhaps, to take gold for\r\nhuman blood; and yet, when mankind is busy in killing one another, there\r\ncan be no great harm in adding a little bit of skin to the plunder.\r\nWhat\'s your sentiments, Hurry, touching these p\'ints?"\r\n\r\n"That you\'ve made a vast mistake, old man, in calling savage blood human\r\nblood, at all. I think no more of a red-skin\'s scalp than I do of a pair\r\nof wolf\'s ears; and would just as lief finger money for the one as for\r\nthe other. With white people \'t is different, for they\'ve a nat\'ral\r\navarsion to being scalped; whereas your Indian shaves his head\r\nin readiness for the knife, and leaves a lock of hair by way of\r\nbraggadocio, that one can lay hold of in the bargain."\r\n\r\n"That\'s manly, however, and I felt from the first that we had only to\r\nget you on our side, to have your heart and hand," returned Tom, losing\r\nall his reserve, as he gained a renewed confidence in the disposition\r\nof his companions. "Something more may turn up from this inroad of the\r\nred-skins than they bargained for. Deerslayer, I conclude you\'re of\r\nHurry\'s way of thinking, and look upon money \'arned in this way as being\r\nas likely to pass as money \'arned in trapping or hunting."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no such feelin\', nor any wish to harbor it, not I," returned\r\nthe other. "My gifts are not scalpers\' gifts, but such as belong to my\r\nreligion and color. I\'ll stand by you, old man, in the ark or in the\r\ncastle, the canoe or the woods, but I\'ll not unhumanize my natur\' by\r\nfalling into ways that God intended for another race. If you and\r\nHurry have got any thoughts that lean towards the colony\'s gold, go by\r\nyourselves in s\'arch of it, and leave the females to my care. Much as I\r\nmust differ from you both on all gifts that do not properly belong to a\r\nwhite man, we shall agree that it is the duty of the strong to take\r\ncare of the weak, especially when the last belong to them that natur\'\r\nintended man to protect and console by his gentleness and strength."\r\n\r\n"Hurry Harry, that is a lesson you might learn and practise on to some\r\nadvantage," said the sweet, but spirited voice of Judith, from the\r\ncabin; a proof that she had over-heard all that had hitherto been said.\r\n\r\n"No more of this, Jude," called out the father angrily. "Move farther\r\noff; we are about to talk of matters unfit for a woman to listen to."\r\n\r\nHutter did not take any steps, however, to ascertain whether he\r\nwas obeyed or not; but dropping his voice a little, he pursued the\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n"The young man is right, Hurry," he said; "and we can leave the children\r\nin his care. Now, my idea is just this; and I think you\'ll agree that it\r\nis rational and correct. There\'s a large party of these savages on shore\r\nand, though I didn\'t tell it before the girls, for they\'re womanish,\r\nand apt to be troublesome when anything like real work is to be done,\r\nthere\'s women among \'em. This I know from moccasin prints; and \'t is\r\nlikely they are hunters, after all, who have been out so long that they\r\nknow nothing of the war, or of the bounties."\r\n\r\n"In which case, old Tom, why was their first salute an attempt to cut\r\nour throats?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know that their design was so bloody. It\'s natural and easy\r\nfor an Indian to fall into ambushes and surprises; and, no doubt they\r\nwished to get on board the ark first, and to make their conditions\r\nafterwards. That a disapp\'inted savage should fire at us, is in rule;\r\nand I think nothing of that. Besides, how often they burned me out,\r\nand robbed my traps--ay, and pulled trigger on me, in the most peaceful\r\ntimes?"\r\n\r\n"The blackguards will do such things, I must allow; and we pay \'em off\r\npretty much in their own c\'ine. Women would not be on the war-path,\r\nsartainly; and, so far, there\'s reason in your idee."\r\n\r\n"Nor would a hunter be in his war-paint," returned Deerslayer. "I saw\r\nthe Mingos, and know that they are out on the trail of mortal men; and\r\nnot for beaver or deer."\r\n\r\n"There you have it ag\'in, old fellow," said Hurry. "In the way of an\r\neye, now, I\'d as soon trust this young man, as trust the oldest settler\r\nin the colony; if he says paint, why paint it was."\r\n\r\n"Then a hunting-party and a war-party have met, for women must have been\r\nwith \'em. It\'s only a few days since the runner went through with the\r\ntidings of the troubles; and it may be that warriors have come out to\r\ncall in their women and children, to get an early blow."\r\n\r\n"That would stand the courts, and is just the truth," cried Hurry;\r\n"you\'ve got it now, old Tom, and I should like to hear what you mean to\r\nmake out of it."\r\n\r\n"The bounty," returned the other, looking up at his attentive companion\r\nin a cool, sullen manner, in which, however, heartless cupidity and\r\nindifference to the means were far more conspicuous than any feelings of\r\nanimosity or revenge.\r\n\r\n"If there\'s women, there\'s children; and big and little have scalps; the\r\ncolony pays for all alike."\r\n\r\n"More shame to it, that it should do so," interrupted Deerslayer;\r\n"more shame to it, that it don\'t understand its gifts, and pay greater\r\nattention to the will of God."\r\n\r\n"Hearken to reason, lad, and don\'t cry out afore you understand a\r\ncase," returned the unmoved Hurry; "the savages scalp your fri\'nds, the\r\nDelawares, or Mohicans whichever they may be, among the rest; and why\r\nshouldn\'t we scalp? I will own, it would be ag\'in right for you and me\r\nnow, to go into the settlements and bring out scalps, but it\'s a very\r\ndifferent matter as concerns Indians. A man shouldn\'t take scalps, if he\r\nisn\'t ready to be scalped, himself, on fitting occasions. One good turn\r\ndesarves another, the world over. That\'s reason, and I believe it to be\r\ngood religion."\r\n\r\n"Ay, Master Hurry," again interrupted the rich voice of Judith, "is it\r\nreligion to say that one bad turn deserves another?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never reason ag\'in you, Judy, for you beat me with beauty, if you\r\ncan\'t with sense. Here\'s the Canadas paying their Injins for scalps, and\r\nwhy not we pay--"\r\n\r\n"Our Indians!" exclaimed the girl, laughing with a sort of melancholy\r\nmerriment. "Father, father! think no more of this, and listen to the\r\nadvice of Deerslayer, who has a conscience; which is more than I can say\r\nor think of Harry March."\r\n\r\nHutter now rose, and, entering the cabin, he compelled his daughters\r\nto go into the adjoining room, when he secured both the doors, and\r\nreturned. Then he and Hurry pursued the subject; but, as the purport of\r\nall that was material in this discourse will appear in the narrative,\r\nit need not be related here in detail. The reader, however, can have\r\nno difficulty in comprehending the morality that presided over their\r\nconference. It was, in truth, that which, in some form or other, rules\r\nmost of the acts of men, and in which the controlling principle is that\r\none wrong will justify another. Their enemies paid for scalps, and this\r\nwas sufficient to justify the colony for retaliating. It is true, the\r\nFrench used the same argument, a circumstance, as Hurry took occasion\r\nto observe in answer to one of Deerslayer\'s objections, that proved its\r\ntruth, as mortal enemies would not be likely to have recourse to the\r\nsame reason unless it were a good one. But neither Hutter nor Hurry was\r\na man likely to stick at trifles in matters connected with the right of\r\nthe aborigines, since it is one of the consequences of aggression that\r\nit hardens the conscience, as the only means of quieting it. In the\r\nmost peaceable state of the country, a species of warfare was carried on\r\nbetween the Indians, especially those of the Canadas, and men of their\r\ncaste; and the moment an actual and recognized warfare existed, it was\r\nregarded as the means of lawfully revenging a thousand wrongs, real\r\nand imaginary. Then, again, there was some truth, and a good deal of\r\nexpediency, in the principle of retaliation, of which they both\r\navailed themselves, in particular, to answer the objections of their\r\njuster-minded and more scrupulous companion.\r\n\r\n"You must fight a man with his own we\'pons, Deerslayer," cried Hurry,\r\nin his uncouth dialect, and in his dogmatical manner of disposing of all\r\noral propositions; "if he\'s f\'erce you must be f\'ercer; if he\'s stout\r\nof heart, you must be stouter. This is the way to get the better of\r\nChristian or savage: by keeping up to this trail, you\'ll get soonest to\r\nthe ind of your journey."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not Moravian doctrine, which teaches that all are to be judged\r\naccording to their talents or l\'arning; the Injin like an Injin; and the\r\nwhite man like a white man. Some of their teachers say, that if you\'re\r\nstruck on the cheek, it\'s a duty to turn the other side of the face, and\r\ntake another blow, instead of seeking revenge, whereby I understand--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough!" shouted Hurry; "that\'s all I want, to prove a man\'s\r\ndoctrine! How long would it take to kick a man through the colony--in at\r\none ind and out at the other, on that principle?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mistake me, March," returned the young hunter, with dignity; "I\r\ndon\'t understand by this any more than that it\'s best to do this, if\r\npossible. Revenge is an Injin gift, and forgiveness a white man\'s.\r\nThat\'s all. Overlook all you can is what\'s meant; and not revenge all\r\nyou can. As for kicking, Master Hurry," and Deerslayer\'s sunburnt cheek\r\nflushed as he continued, "into the colony, or out of the colony, that\'s\r\nneither here nor there, seeing no one proposes it, and no one would\r\nbe likely to put up with it. What I wish to say is, that a red-skin\'s\r\nscalping don\'t justify a pale-face\'s scalping."\r\n\r\n"Do as you\'re done by, Deerslayer; that\'s ever the Christian parson\'s\r\ndoctrine."\r\n\r\n"No, Hurry, I\'ve asked the Moravians consarning that; and it\'s\r\naltogether different. \'Do as you would be done by,\' they tell me, is the\r\ntrue saying, while men practyse the false. They think all the colonies\r\nwrong that offer bounties for scalps, and believe no blessing will\r\nfollow the measures. Above all things, they forbid revenge."\r\n\r\n"That for your Moravians!" cried March, snapping his fingers; "they\'re\r\nthe next thing to Quakers; and if you\'d believe all they tell you, not\r\neven a \'rat would be skinned, out of marcy. Who ever heard of marcy on a\r\nmuskrat!"\r\n\r\nThe disdainful manner of Hurry prevented a reply, and he and the old man\r\nresumed the discussion of their plans in a more quiet and confidential\r\nmanner. This confidence lasted until Judith appeared, bearing the simple\r\nbut savory supper. March observed, with a little surprise, that she\r\nplaced the choicest bits before Deerslayer, and that in the little\r\nnameless attentions it was in her power to bestow, she quite obviously\r\nmanifested a desire to let it be seen that she deemed him the honored\r\nguest. Accustomed, however, to the waywardness and coquetry of the\r\nbeauty, this discovery gave him little concern, and he ate with an\r\nappetite that was in no degree disturbed by any moral causes. The\r\neasily-digested food of the forests offering the fewest possible\r\nobstacles to the gratification of this great animal indulgence,\r\nDeerslayer, notwithstanding the hearty meal both had taken in the woods,\r\nwas in no manner behind his companion in doing justice to the viands.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the scene had greatly changed. The lake was still placid\r\nand glassy, but the gloom of the hour had succeeded to the soft twilight\r\nof a summer evening, and all within the dark setting of the woods lay in\r\nthe quiet repose of night. The forests gave up no song, or cry, or\r\neven murmur, but looked down from the hills on the lovely basin they\r\nencircled, in solemn stillness; and the only sound that was audible\r\nwas the regular dip of the sweeps, at which Hurry and Deerslayer lazily\r\npushed, impelling the ark towards the castle. Hutter had withdrawn to\r\nthe stern of the scow, in order to steer, but, finding that the young\r\nmen kept even strokes, and held the desired course by their own skill,\r\nhe permitted the oar to drag in the water, took a seat on the end of the\r\nvessel, and lighted his pipe. He had not been thus placed many minutes,\r\nere Hetty came stealthily out of the cabin, or house, as they usually\r\ntermed that part of the ark, and placed herself at his feet, on a\r\nlittle bench that she brought with her. As this movement was by no means\r\nunusual in his feeble-minded child, the old man paid no other attention\r\nto it than to lay his hand kindly on her head, in an affectionate\r\nand approving manner; an act of grace that the girl received in meek\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause of several minutes, Hetty began to sing. Her voice was\r\nlow and tremulous, but it was earnest and solemn. The words and the\r\ntune were of the simplest form, the first being a hymn that she had been\r\ntaught by her mother, and the last one of those natural melodies\r\nthat find favor with all classes, in every age, coming from and being\r\naddressed to the feelings. Hutter never listened to this simple strain\r\nwithout finding his heart and manner softened; facts that his daughter\r\nwell knew, and by which she had often profited, through the sort of holy\r\ninstinct that enlightens the weak of mind, more especially in their aims\r\ntoward good.\r\n\r\nHetty\'s low, sweet tones had not been raised many moments, when the dip\r\nof the oars ceased, and the holy strain arose singly on the breathing\r\nsilence of the wilderness. As if she gathered courage with the theme,\r\nher powers appeared to increase as she proceeded; and though nothing\r\nvulgar or noisy mingled in her melody, its strength and melancholy\r\ntenderness grew on the ear, until the air was filled with this simple\r\nhomage of a soul that seemed almost spotless. That the men forward\r\nwere not indifferent to this touching interruption, was proved by their\r\ninaction; nor did their oars again dip until the last of the sweet\r\nsounds had actually died among the remarkable shores, which, at that\r\nwitching hour, would waft even the lowest modulations of the human voice\r\nmore than a mile. Hutter was much affected; for rude as he was by early\r\nhabits, and even ruthless as he had got to be by long exposure to the\r\npractices of the wilderness, his nature was of that fearful mixture of\r\ngood and evil that so generally enters into the moral composition of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"You are sad to-night, child," said the father, whose manner and language\r\nusually assumed some of the gentleness and elevation of the civilized\r\nlife he had led in youth, when he thus communed with this particular\r\nchild; "we have just escaped from enemies, and ought rather to rejoice."\r\n\r\n"You can never do it, father!" said Hetty, in a low, remonstrating\r\nmanner, taking his hard, knotty hand into both her own; "you have talked\r\nlong with Harry March; but neither of you have the heart to do it!"\r\n\r\n"This is going beyond your means, foolish child; you must have been\r\nnaughty enough to have listened, or you could know nothing of our talk."\r\n\r\n"Why should you and Hurry kill people--especially women and children?"\r\n\r\n"Peace, girl, peace; we are at war, and must do to our enemies as our\r\nenemies would do to us."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not it, father! I heard Deerslayer say how it was. You must do\r\nto your enemies as you wish your enemies would do to you. No man wishes\r\nhis enemies to kill him."\r\n\r\n"We kill our enemies in war, girl, lest they should kill us. One side or\r\nthe other must begin; and them that begin first, are most apt to get the\r\nvictory. You know nothing about these things, poor Hetty, and had best\r\nsay nothing."\r\n\r\n"Judith says it is wrong, father; and Judith has sense though I have\r\nnone."\r\n\r\n"Jude understands better than to talk to me of these matters; for she\r\nhas sense, as you say, and knows I\'ll not bear it. Which would you\r\nprefer, Hetty; to have your own scalp taken, and sold to the French, or\r\nthat we should kill our enemies, and keep them from harming us?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not it, father! Don\'t kill them, nor let them kill us. Sell your\r\nskins, and get more, if you can; but don\'t sell human blood."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, child; let us talk of matters you understand. Are you glad\r\nto see our old friend, March, back again? You like Hurry, and must know\r\nthat one day he may be your brother--if not something nearer."\r\n\r\n"That can\'t be, father," returned the girl, after a considerable pause;\r\n"Hurry has had one father, and one mother; and people never have two."\r\n\r\n"So much for your weak mind, Hetty. When Jude marries, her husband\'s\r\nfather will be her father, and her husband\'s sister her sister. If she\r\nshould marry Hurry, then he will be your brother."\r\n\r\n"Judith will never have Hurry," returned the girl mildly, but\r\npositively; "Judith don\'t like Hurry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than you can know, Hetty. Harry March is the handsomest,\r\nand the strongest, and the boldest young man that ever visits the lake;\r\nand, as Jude is the greatest beauty, I don\'t see why they shouldn\'t come\r\ntogether. He has as much as promised that he will enter into this job\r\nwith me, on condition that I\'ll consent."\r\n\r\nHetty began to move her body back and forth, and other-wise to express\r\nmental agitation; but she made no answer for more than a minute. Her\r\nfather, accustomed to her manner, and suspecting no immediate cause of\r\nconcern, continued to smoke with the apparent phlegm which would seem to\r\nbelong to that particular species of enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"Hurry is handsome, father," said Hetty, with a simple emphasis, that\r\nshe might have hesitated about using, had her mind been more alive to\r\nthe inferences of others.\r\n\r\n"I told you so, child," muttered old Hutter, without removing the pipe\r\nfrom between his teeth; "he\'s the likeliest youth in these parts; and\r\nJude is the likeliest young woman I\'ve met with since her poor mother\r\nwas in her best days."\r\n\r\n"Is it wicked to be ugly, father?\'"\r\n\r\n"One might be guilty of worse things--but you\'re by no means ugly;\r\nthough not so comely as Jude."\r\n\r\n"Is Judith any happier for being so handsome?"\r\n\r\n"She may be, child, and she may not be. But talk of other matters now,\r\nfor you hardly understand these, poor Hetty. How do you like our new\r\nacquaintance, Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t handsome, father. Hurry is far handsomer than Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true; but they say he is a noted hunter! His fame had reached\r\nme before I ever saw him; and I did hope he would prove to be as stout\r\na warrior as he is dexterous with the deer. All men are not alike,\r\nhowsever, child; and it takes time, as I know by experience, to give a\r\nman a true wilderness heart."\r\n\r\n"Have I got a wilderness heart, father--and Hurry, is his heart true\r\nwilderness?"\r\n\r\n"You sometimes ask queer questions, Hetty! Your heart is good, child,\r\nand fitter for the settlements than for the woods; while your reason is\r\nfitter for the woods than for the settlements."\r\n\r\n"Why has Judith more reason than I, father?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven help thee, child: this is more than I can answer. God gives\r\nsense, and appearance, and all these things; and he grants them as he\r\nseeth fit. Dost thou wish for more sense?"\r\n\r\n"Not I. The little I have troubles me; for when I think the hardest,\r\nthen I feel the unhappiest. I don\'t believe thinking is good for me,\r\nthough I do wish I was as handsome as Judith!"\r\n\r\n"Why so, poor child? Thy sister\'s beauty may cause her trouble, as it\r\ncaused her mother before her. It\'s no advantage, Hetty, to be so marked\r\nfor anything as to become an object of envy, or to be sought after more\r\nthan others."\r\n\r\n"Mother was good, if she was handsome," returned the girl, the tears\r\nstarting to her eyes, as usually happened when she adverted to her\r\ndeceased parent.\r\n\r\nOld Hutter, if not equally affected, was moody and silent at this\r\nallusion to his wife. He continued smoking, without appearing disposed\r\nto make any answer, until his simple-minded daughter repeated her\r\nremark, in a way to show that she felt uneasiness lest he might be\r\ninclined to deny her assertion. Then he knocked the ashes out of his\r\npipe, and laying his hand in a sort of rough kindness on the girl\'s\r\nhead, he made a reply.\r\n\r\n"Thy mother was too good for this world," he said; "though others might\r\nnot think so. Her good looks did not befriend her; and you have no\r\noccasion to mourn that you are not as much like her as your sister.\r\nThink less of beauty, child, and more of your duty, and you\'ll be as\r\nhappy on this lake as you could be in the king\'s palace."\r\n\r\n"I know it, father; but Hurry says beauty is everything in a young\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\nHutter made an ejaculation expressive of dissatisfaction, and went\r\nforward, passing through the house in order to do so. Hetty\'s simple\r\nbetrayal of her weakness in behalf of March gave him uneasiness on a\r\nsubject concerning which he had never felt before, and he determined\r\nto come to an explanation at once with his visitor; for directness of\r\nspeech and decision in conduct were two of the best qualities of\r\nthis rude being, in whom the seeds of a better education seemed to be\r\nconstantly struggling upwards, to be choked by the fruits of a life in\r\nwhich his hard struggles for subsistence and security had steeled his\r\nfeelings and indurated his nature. When he reached the forward end of\r\nthe scow, he manifested an intention to relieve Deerslayer at the oar,\r\ndirecting the latter to take his own place aft. By these changes, the\r\nold man and Hurry were again left alone, while the young hunter was\r\ntransferred to the other end of the ark.\r\n\r\nHetty had disappeared when Deerslayer reached his new post, and for some\r\nlittle time he directed the course of the slow-moving craft by himself.\r\nIt was not long, however, before Judith came out of the cabin, as if\r\ndisposed to do the honors of the place to a stranger engaged in the\r\nservice of her family. The starlight was sufficient to permit objects to\r\nbe plainly distinguished when near at hand, and the bright eyes of the\r\ngirl had an expression of kindness in them, when they met those of the\r\nyouth, that the latter was easily enabled to discover. Her rich\r\nhair shaded her spirited and yet soft countenance, even at that hour\r\nrendering it the more beautiful--as the rose is loveliest when reposing\r\namid the shadows and contrasts of its native foliage. Little ceremony\r\nis used in the intercourse of the woods; and Judith had acquired a\r\nreadiness of address, by the admiration that she so generally excited,\r\nwhich, if it did not amount to forwardness, certainly in no degree lent\r\nto her charms the aid of that retiring modesty on which poets love to\r\ndwell.\r\n\r\n"I thought I should have killed myself with laughing, Deerslayer," the\r\nbeauty abruptly but coquettishly commenced, "when I saw that Indian\r\ndive into the river! He was a good-looking savage, too," the girl always\r\ndwelt on personal beauty as a sort of merit, "and yet one couldn\'t stop\r\nto consider whether his paint would stand water!"\r\n\r\n"And I thought they would have killed you with their we\'pons, Judith,"\r\nreturned Deerslayer; "it was an awful risk for a female to run in the\r\nface of a dozen Mingos!"\r\n\r\n"Did that make you come out of the cabin, in spite of their rifles,\r\ntoo?" asked the girl, with more real interest than she would have cared\r\nto betray, though with an indifference of manner that was the result of\r\na good deal of practice united to native readiness.\r\n\r\n"Men ar\'n\'t apt to see females in danger, and not come to their\r\nassistance. Even a Mingo knows that."\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was uttered with as much simplicity of manner as of\r\nfeeling, and Judith rewarded it with a smile so sweet, that even\r\nDeerslayer, who had imbibed a prejudice against the girl in consequence\r\nof Hurry\'s suspicions of her levity, felt its charm, notwithstanding\r\nhalf its winning influence was lost in the feeble light. It at once\r\ncreated a sort of confidence between them, and the discourse was\r\ncontinued on the part of the hunter, without the lively consciousness\r\nof the character of this coquette of the wilderness, with which it had\r\ncertainly commenced.\r\n\r\n"You are a man of deeds, and not of words, I see plainly, Deerslayer,"\r\ncontinued the beauty, taking her seat near the spot where the other\r\nstood, "and I foresee we shall be very good friends. Hurry Harry has a\r\ntongue, and, giant as he is, he talks more than he performs."\r\n\r\n"March is your fri\'nd, Judith; and fri\'nds should be tender of each\r\nother, when apart."\r\n\r\n"We all know what Hurry\'s friendship comes to! Let him have his own way\r\nin everything, and he\'s the best fellow in the colony; but \'head him\r\noff,\' as you say of the deer, and he is master of everything near him\r\nbut himself. Hurry is no favorite of mine, Deerslayer; and I dare say,\r\nif the truth was known, and his conversation about me repeated, it would\r\nbe found that he thinks no better of me than I own I do of him."\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech was not uttered without uneasiness. Had\r\nthe girl\'s companion been more sophisticated, he might have observed the\r\naverted face, the manner in which the pretty little foot was agitated,\r\nand other signs that, for some unexplained reason, the opinions of March\r\nwere not quite as much a matter of indifference to her as she thought\r\nfit to pretend. Whether this was no more than the ordinary working of\r\nfemale vanity, feeling keenly even when it affected not to feel at all,\r\nor whether it proceeded from that deeply-seated consciousness of right\r\nand wrong which God himself has implanted in our breasts that we may\r\nknow good from evil, will be made more apparent to the reader as we\r\nproceed in the tale. Deerslayer felt embarrassed. He well remembered the\r\ncruel imputations left by March\'s distrust; and, while he did not wish\r\nto injure his associate\'s suit by exciting resentment against him, his\r\ntongue was one that literally knew no guile. To answer without saying\r\nmore or less than he wished, was consequently a delicate duty.\r\n\r\n"March has his say of all things in natur\', whether of fri\'nd or foe,"\r\nslowly and cautiously rejoined the hunter. "He\'s one of them that speak\r\nas they feel while the tongue\'s a-going, and that\'s sometimes different\r\nfrom what they\'d speak if they took time to consider. Give me a\r\nDelaware, Judith, for one that reflects and ruminates on his idees!\r\nInmity has made him thoughtful, and a loose tongue is no ricommend at\r\ntheir council fires."\r\n\r\n"I dare say March\'s tongue goes free enough when it gets on the subject\r\nof Judith Hutter and her sister," said the girl, rousing herself as if\r\nin careless disdain. "Young women\'s good names are a pleasant matter of\r\ndiscourse with some that wouldn\'t dare be so open-mouthed if there was a\r\nbrother in the way. Master March may find it pleasant to traduce us, but\r\nsooner or later he\'ll repent.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Judith, this is taking the matter up too much in \'arnest. Hurry\r\nhas never whispered a syllable ag\'in the good name of Hetty, to begin\r\nwith--"\r\n\r\n"I see how it is--I see how it is," impetuously interrupted Judith.\r\n"I am the one he sees fit to scorch with his withering tongue! Hetty,\r\nindeed! Poor Hetty!" she continued, her voice sinking into low, husky\r\ntones, that seemed nearly to stifle her in the utterance; "she is beyond\r\nand above his slanderous malice! Poor Hetty! If God has created her\r\nfeeble-minded, the weakness lies altogether on the side of errors of\r\nwhich she seems to know nothing. The earth never held a purer being than\r\nHetty Hutter, Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"I can believe it--yes, I can believe that, Judith, and I hope \'arnestly\r\nthat the same can be said of her handsome sister."\r\n\r\nThere was a soothing sincerity in the voice of Deerslayer, which touched\r\nthe girl\'s feelings; nor did the allusion to her beauty lessen the\r\neffect with one who only knew too well the power of her personal charms.\r\nNevertheless, the still, small voice of conscience was not hushed, and\r\nit prompted the answer which she made, after giving herself time to\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\n"I dare say Hurry had some of his vile hints about the people of the\r\ngarrisons," she added. "He knows they are gentlemen, and can never\r\nforgive any one for being what he feels he can never become himself."\r\n\r\n"Not in the sense of a king\'s officer, Judith, sartainly, for March\r\nhas no turn that-a-way; but in the sense of reality, why may not a\r\nbeaver-hunter be as respectable as a governor? Since you speak of it\r\nyourself, I\'ll not deny that he did complain of one as humble as you\r\nbeing so much in the company of scarlet coats and silken sashes. But \'t\r\nwas jealousy that brought it out of him, and I do think he mourned over\r\nhis own thoughts as a mother would have mourned over her child."\r\n\r\nPerhaps Deerslayer was not aware of the full meaning that his earnest\r\nlanguage conveyed. It is certain that he did not see the color that\r\ncrimsoned the whole of Judith\'s fine face, nor detect the uncontrollable\r\ndistress that immediately after changed its hue to deadly paleness. A\r\nminute or two elapsed in profound stillness, the splash of the water\r\nseeming to occupy all the avenues of sound; and then Judith arose, and\r\ngrasped the hand of the hunter, almost convulsively, with one of her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer," she said, hurriedly, "I\'m glad the ice is broke between\r\nus. They say that sudden friendships lead to long enmities, but I do not\r\nbelieve it will turn out so with us. I know not how it is--but you are\r\nthe first man I ever met, who did not seem to wish to flatter--to wish\r\nmy ruin--to be an enemy in disguise--never mind; say nothing to Hurry,\r\nand another time we\'ll talk together again."\r\n\r\nAs the girl released her grasp, she vanished in the house, leaving the\r\nastonished young man standing at the steering-oar, as motionless as\r\none of the pines on the hills. So abstracted, indeed, had his thoughts\r\nbecome, that he was hailed by Hutter to keep the scow\'s head in the\r\nright direction, before he remembered his actual situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "So spake the apostate Angel, though in pain,\r\n    Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair."\r\n\r\n    Paradise lost, I.  125-26.\r\n\r\nShortly after the disappearance of Judith, a light southerly air arose,\r\nand Hutter set a large square sail, that had once been the flying\r\ntop-sail of an Albany sloop, but which having become threadbare in\r\ncatching the breezes of Tappan, had been condemned and sold. He had a\r\nlight, tough spar of tamarack that he could raise on occasion, and with\r\na little contrivance, his duck was spread to the wind in a sufficiently\r\nprofessional manner. The effect on the ark was such as to supersede the\r\nnecessity of rowing; and in about two hours the castle was seen, in the\r\ndarkness, rising out of the water, at the distance of a hundred yards.\r\nThe sail was then lowered, and by slow degrees the scow drifted up to\r\nthe building, and was secured.\r\n\r\nNo one had visited the house since Hurry and his companion left it. The\r\nplace was found in the quiet of midnight, a sort of type of the solitude\r\nof a wilderness. As an enemy was known to be near, Hutter directed his\r\ndaughters to abstain from the use of lights, luxuries in which they\r\nseldom indulged during the warm months, lest they might prove beacons to\r\ndirect their foes where they might be found.\r\n\r\n"In open daylight I shouldn\'t fear a host of savages behind these stout\r\nlogs, and they without any cover to skulk into," added Hutter, when he\r\nhad explained to his guests the reasons why he forbade the use of light;\r\n"for I\'ve three or four trusty weapons always loaded, and Killdeer, in\r\nparticular, is a piece that never misses. But it\'s a different thing at\r\nnight. A canoe might get upon us unseen, in the dark; and the savages\r\nhave so many cunning ways of attacking, that I look upon it as bad\r\nenough to deal with \'em under a bright sun. I built this dwelling in\r\norder to have \'em at arm\'s length, in case we should ever get to\r\nblows again. Some people think it\'s too open and exposed, but I\'m for\r\nanchoring out here, clear of underbrush and thickets, as the surest\r\nmeans of making a safe berth."\r\n\r\n"You was once a sailor, they tell me, old Tom?" said Hurry, in his\r\nabrupt manner, struck by one or two expressions that the other had just\r\nused, "and some people believe you could give us strange accounts of\r\ninimies and shipwrecks, if you\'d a mind to come out with all you know?"\r\n\r\n"There are people in this world, Hurry," returned the other, evasively,\r\n"who live on other men\'s thoughts; and some such often find their way\r\ninto the woods. What I\'ve been, or what I\'ve seen in youth, is of less\r\nmatter now than what the savages are. It\'s of more account to find out\r\nwhat will happen in the next twenty-four hours than to talk over what\r\nhappened twenty-four years since."\r\n\r\n"That\'s judgment, Deerslayer; yes, that\'s sound judgment. Here\'s Judith\r\nand Hetty to take care of, to say nothing of our own top-knots; and, for\r\nmy part, I can sleep as well in the dark as I could under a noonday sun.\r\nTo me it\'s no great matter whether there is light or not, to see to shut\r\nmy eyes by."\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer seldom thought it necessary to answer his companion\'s\r\npeculiar vein of humor, and Hutter was evidently indisposed to dwell\r\nlonger on the subject, it\'s discussion ceased with this remark. The\r\nlatter had something more on his mind, however, than recollections. His\r\ndaughters had no sooner left them, with an expressed intention of going\r\nto bed, than he invited his two companions to follow him again into the\r\nscow. Here the old man opened his project, keeping back the portion that\r\nhe had reserved for execution by Hurry and himself.\r\n\r\n"The great object for people posted like ourselves is to command the\r\nwater," he commenced. "So long as there is no other craft on the lake,\r\na bark canoe is as good as a man-of-war, since the castle will not be\r\neasily taken by swimming. Now, there are but five canoes remaining in\r\nthese parts, two of which are mine, and one is Hurry\'s. These three\r\nwe have with us here; one being fastened in the canoe-dock beneath the\r\nhouse, and the other two being alongside the scow. The other canoes\r\nare housed on the shore, in hollow logs, and the savages, who are such\r\nvenomous enemies, will leave no likely place unexamined in the morning,\r\nif they \'re serious in s\'arch of bounties--"\r\n\r\n"Now, friend Hutter," interrupted Hurry, "the Indian don\'t live that\r\ncan find a canoe that is suitably wintered. I\'ve done something at this\r\nbusiness before now, and Deerslayer here knows that I am one that can\r\nhide a craft in such a way that I can\'t find it myself."\r\n\r\n"Very true, Hurry," put in the person to whom the appeal had been made,\r\n"but you overlook the sarcumstance that if you couldn\'t see the trail of\r\nthe man who did the job, I could. I\'m of Master Hutter\'s mind, that\r\nit\'s far wiser to mistrust a savage\'s ingenuity, than to build any great\r\nexpectations on his want of eye-sight. If these two canoes can be got\r\noff to the castle, therefore, the sooner it\'s done the better."\r\n\r\n"Will you be of the party that\'s to do it?" demanded Hutter, in a way to\r\nshow that the proposal both surprised and pleased him.\r\n\r\n"Sartain. I\'m ready to enlist in any enterprise that\'s not ag\'in a white\r\nman\'s lawful gifts. Natur\' orders us to defend our lives, and the lives\r\nof others, too, when there\'s occasion and opportunity. I\'ll follow you,\r\nFloating Tom, into the Mingo camp, on such an arr\'nd, and will strive to\r\ndo my duty, should we come to blows; though, never having been tried in\r\nbattle, I don\'t like to promise more than I may be able to perform. We\r\nall know our wishes, but none know their might till put to the proof."\r\n\r\n"That\'s modest and suitable, lad," exclaimed Hurry. "You\'ve never\r\nyet heard the crack of an angry rifle; and, let me tell you, \'tis as\r\ndifferent from the persuasion of one of your venison speeches, as the\r\nlaugh of Judith Hutter, in her best humor, is from the scolding of a\r\nDutch house keeper on the Mohawk. I don\'t expect you\'ll prove much of a\r\nwarrior, Deerslayer, though your equal with the bucks and the does don\'t\r\nexist in all these parts. As for the ra\'al sarvice, however, you\'ll turn\r\nout rather rearward, according to my consait."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see, Hurry, we\'ll see," returned the other, meekly; so far as\r\nhuman eye could discover, not at all disturbed by these expressed doubts\r\nconcerning his conduct on a point on which men are sensitive, precisely\r\nin the degree that they feel the consciousness of demerit; "having never\r\nbeen tried, I\'ll wait to know, before I form any opinion of myself; and\r\nthen there\'ll be sartainty, instead of bragging. I\'ve heard of them\r\nthat was valiant afore the fight, who did little in it; and of them that\r\nwaited to know their own tempers, and found that they weren\'t as bad as\r\nsome expected, when put to the proof."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we know you can use a paddle, young man," said Hutter,\r\n"and that\'s all we shall ask of you to-night. Let us waste no more time,\r\nbut get into the canoe, and do, in place of talking."\r\n\r\nAs Hutter led the way, in the execution of his project, the boat was\r\nsoon ready, with Hurry and Deerslayer at the paddles. Before the old man\r\nembarked himself, however, he held a conference of several minutes with\r\nJudith, entering the house for that purpose; then, returning, he took\r\nhis place in the canoe, which left the side of the ark at the next\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nHad there been a temple reared to God, in that solitary wilderness, its\r\nclock would have told the hour of midnight as the party set forth on\r\ntheir expedition. The darkness had increased, though the night was still\r\nclear, and the light of the stars sufficed for all the purposes of the\r\nadventurers. Hutter alone knew the places where the canoes were hid,\r\nand he directed the course, while his two athletic companions raised\r\nand dipped their paddles with proper caution, lest the sound should be\r\ncarried to the ears of their enemies, across that sheet of placid water,\r\nin the stillness of deep night. But the bark was too light to require\r\nany extraordinary efforts, and skill supplying the place of strength,\r\nin about half an hour they were approaching the shore, at a point near a\r\nleague from the castle.\r\n\r\n"Lay on your paddles, men," said Hutter, in a low voice, "and let us\r\nlook about us for a moment. We must now be all eyes and ears, for these\r\nvermin have noses like bloodhounds."\r\n\r\nThe shores of the lake were examined closely, in order to discover any\r\nglimmering of light that might have been left in a camp; and the men\r\nstrained their eyes, in the obscurity, to see if some thread of smoke\r\nwas not still stealing along the mountainside, as it arose from the\r\ndying embers of a fire. Nothing unusual could be traced; and as the\r\nposition was at some distance from the outlet, or the spot where the\r\nsavages had been met, it was thought safe to land. The paddles were\r\nplied again, and the bows of the canoe ground upon the gravelly beach\r\nwith a gentle motion, and a sound barely audible. Hutter and Hurry\r\nimmediately landed, the former carrying his own and his friend\'s rifle,\r\nleaving Deerslayer in charge of the canoe. The hollow log lay a little\r\ndistance up the side of the mountain, and the old man led the way\r\ntowards it, using so much caution as to stop at every third or fourth\r\nstep, to listen if any tread betrayed the presence of a foe. The same\r\ndeath-like stillness, however, reigned on the midnight scene, and the\r\ndesired place was reached without an occurrence to induce alarm.\r\n\r\n"This is it," whispered Hutter, laying a foot on the trunk of a fallen\r\nlinden; "hand me the paddles first, and draw the boat out with care, for\r\nthe wretches may have left it for a bait, after all."\r\n\r\n"Keep my rifle handy, butt towards me, old fellow," answered March.\r\n"If they attack me loaded, I shall want to unload the piece at \'em, at\r\nleast. And feel if the pan is full."\r\n\r\n"All\'s right," muttered the other; "move slow, when you get your load,\r\nand let me lead the way."\r\n\r\nThe canoe was drawn out of the log with the utmost care, raised by Hurry\r\nto his shoulder, and the two began to return to the shore, moving but\r\na step at a time, lest they should tumble down the steep declivity. The\r\ndistance was not great, but the descent was extremely difficult; and,\r\ntowards the end of their little journey, Deerslayer was obliged to land\r\nand meet them, in order to aid in lifting the canoe through the bushes.\r\nWith his assistance the task was successfully accomplished, and the\r\nlight craft soon floated by the side of the other canoe. This was no\r\nsooner done, than all three turned anxiously towards the forest and the\r\nmountain, expecting an enemy to break out of the one, or to come rushing\r\ndown the other. Still the silence was unbroken, and they all embarked\r\nwith the caution that had been used in coming ashore.\r\n\r\nHutter now steered broad off towards the centre of the lake. Having got\r\na sufficient distance from the shore, he cast his prize loose, knowing\r\nthat it would drift slowly up the lake before the light southerly air,\r\nand intending to find it on his return. Thus relieved of his tow, the\r\nold man held his way down the lake, steering towards the very point\r\nwhere Hurry had made his fruitless attempt on the life of the deer. As\r\nthe distance from this point to the outlet was less than a mile, it\r\nwas like entering an enemy\'s country; and redoubled caution became\r\nnecessary. They reached the extremity of the point, however, and landed\r\nin safety on the little gravelly beach already mentioned. Unlike the\r\nlast place at which they had gone ashore, here was no acclivity to\r\nascend, the mountains looming up in the darkness quite a quarter of a\r\nmile farther west, leaving a margin of level ground between them and the\r\nstrand. The point itself, though long, and covered with tall trees, was\r\nnearly flat, and for some distance only a few yards in width. Hutter and\r\nHurry landed as before, leaving their companion in charge of the boat.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the dead tree that contained the canoe of which they\r\nhad come in quest lay about half-way between the extremity of the narrow\r\nslip of land and the place where it joined the main shore; and knowing\r\nthat there was water so near him on his left, the old man led the way\r\nalong the eastern side of the belt with some confidence walking boldly,\r\nthough still with caution. He had landed at the point expressly to get\r\na glimpse into the bay and to make certain that the coast was clear;\r\notherwise he would have come ashore directly abreast of the hollow tree.\r\nThere was no difficulty in finding the latter, from which the canoe\r\nwas drawn as before, and instead of carrying it down to the place where\r\nDeerslayer lay, it was launched at the nearest favorable spot. As soon\r\nas it was in the water, Hurry entered it, and paddled round to the\r\npoint, whither Hutter also proceeded, following the beach. As the\r\nthree men had now in their possession all the boats on the lake, their\r\nconfidence was greatly increased, and there was no longer the same\r\nfeverish desire to quit the shore, or the same necessity for extreme\r\ncaution. Their position on the extremity of the long, narrow bit of land\r\nadded to the feeling of security, as it permitted an enemy to approach\r\nin only one direction, that in their front, and under circumstances that\r\nwould render discovery, with their habitual vigilance, almost certain.\r\nThe three now landed together, and stood grouped in consultation on the\r\ngravelly point.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve fairly tree\'d the scamps," said Hurry, chuckling at their\r\nsuccess; "if they wish to visit the castle, let \'em wade or swim! Old\r\nTom, that idee of your\'n, in burrowing out in the lake, was high proof,\r\nand carries a fine bead. There be men who would think the land safer\r\nthan the water; but, after all, reason shows it isn\'t; the beaver, and\r\nrats, and other l\'arned creatur\'s taking to the last when hard pressed.\r\nI call our position now, entrenched, and set the Canadas at defiance."\r\n\r\n"Let us paddle along this south shore," said Hutter, "and see if there\'s\r\nno sign of an encampment; but, first, let me have a better look into the\r\nbay, for no one has been far enough round the inner shore of the point\r\nto make suit of that quarter yet."\r\n\r\nAs Hutter ceased speaking, all three moved in the direction he had\r\nnamed. Scarce had they fairly opened the bottom of the bay, when a\r\ngeneral start proved that their eyes had lighted on a common object\r\nat the same instant. It was no more than a dying brand, giving out its\r\nflickering and failing light; but at that hour, and in that place, it\r\nwas at once as conspicuous as "a good deed in a naughty world."\r\nThere was not a shadow of doubt that this fire had been kindled at an\r\nencampment of the Indians. The situation, sheltered from observation on\r\nall sides but one, and even on that except for a very short distance,\r\nproved that more care had been taken to conceal the spot than would be\r\nused for ordinary purposes, and Hutter, who knew that a spring was\r\nnear at hand, as well as one of the best fishing-stations on the lake,\r\nimmediately inferred that this encampment contained the women and\r\nchildren of the party.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a warrior\'s encampment," he growled to Hurry; "and there\'s\r\nbounty enough sleeping round that fire to make a heavy division of\r\nhead-money. Send the lad to the canoes, for there\'ll come no good of him\r\nin such an onset, and let us take the matter in hand at once, like men."\r\n\r\n"There\'s judgment in your notion, old Tom, and I like it to the\r\nbackbone. Deerslayer, do you get into the canoe, lad, and paddle off\r\ninto the lake with the spare one, and set it adrift, as we did with the\r\nother; after which you can float along shore, as near as you can get to\r\nthe head of the bay, keeping outside the point, howsever, and outside\r\nthe rushes, too. You can hear us when we want you; and if there\'s any\r\ndelay, I\'ll call like a loon--yes, that\'ll do it--the call of a loon\r\nshall be the signal. If you hear rifles, and feel like sogering, why,\r\nyou may close in, and see if you can make the same hand with the savages\r\nthat you do with the deer."\r\n\r\n"If my wishes could be followed, this matter would not be undertaken,\r\nHurry----"\r\n\r\n"Quite true--nobody denies it, boy; but your wishes can\'t be followed;\r\nand that inds the matter. So just canoe yourself off into the middle\r\nof the lake, and by the time you get back there\'ll be movements in that\r\ncamp!"\r\n\r\nThe young man set about complying with great reluctance and a heavy\r\nheart. He knew the prejudices of the frontiermen too well, however, to\r\nattempt a remonstrance. The latter, indeed, under the circumstances,\r\nmight prove dangerous, as it would certainly prove useless. He paddled\r\nthe canoe, therefore, silently and with the former caution, to a spot\r\nnear the centre of the placid sheet of water, and set the boat just\r\nrecovered adrift, to float towards the castle, before the light\r\nsoutherly air. This expedient had been adopted, in both cases, under\r\nthe certainty that the drift could not carry the light barks more than\r\na league or two, before the return of light, when they might easily be\r\novertaken in order to prevent any wandering savage from using them, by\r\nswimming off and getting possession, a possible but scarcely a probable\r\nevent, all the paddles were retained.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he set the recovered canoe adrift, than Deerslayer\r\nturned the bows of his own towards the point on the shore that had been\r\nindicated by Hurry. So light was the movement of the little craft,\r\nand so steady the sweep of its master\'s arm, that ten minutes had not\r\nelapsed ere it was again approaching the land, having, in that brief\r\ntime, passed over fully half a mile of distance. As soon as Deerslayer\'s\r\neye caught a glimpse of the rushes, of which there were many growing in\r\nthe water a hundred feet from the shore, he arrested the motion of\r\nthe canoe, and anchored his boat by holding fast to the delicate\r\nbut tenacious stem of one of the drooping plants. Here he remained,\r\nawaiting, with an intensity of suspense that can be easily imagined, the\r\nresult of the hazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to convey to the minds of those who have never\r\nwitnessed it, the sublimity that characterizes the silence of a solitude\r\nas deep as that which now reigned over the Glimmerglass. In the present\r\ninstance, this sublimity was increased by the gloom of night, which\r\nthrew its shadowy and fantastic forms around the lake, the forest,\r\nand the hills. It is not easy, indeed, to conceive of any place more\r\nfavorable to heighten these natural impressions, than that Deerslayer\r\nnow occupied. The size of the lake brought all within the reach of human\r\nsenses, while it displayed so much of the imposing scene at a single\r\nview, giving up, as it might be, at a glance, a sufficiency to produce\r\nthe deepest impressions. As has been said, this was the first lake\r\nDeerslayer had ever seen. Hitherto, his experience had been limited to\r\nthe courses of rivers and smaller streams, and never before had he seen\r\nso much of that wilderness, which he so well loved, spread before\r\nhis gaze. Accustomed to the forest, however, his mind was capable\r\nof portraying all its hidden mysteries, as he looked upon its leafy\r\nsurface. This was also the first time he had been on a trail where human\r\nlives depended on the issue. His ears had often drunk in the traditions\r\nof frontier warfare, but he had never yet been confronted with an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily understand, therefore, how intense must have\r\nbeen the expectation of the young man, as he sat in his solitary canoe,\r\nendeavoring to catch the smallest sound that might denote the course of\r\nthings on shore. His training had been perfect, so far as theory could\r\ngo, and his self-possession, notwithstanding the high excitement, that\r\nwas the fruit of novelty, would have done credit to a veteran. The\r\nvisible evidences of the existence of the camp, or of the fire could not\r\nbe detected from the spot where the canoe lay, and he was compelled to\r\ndepend on the sense of hearing alone. He did not feel impatient, for\r\nthe lessons he had heard taught him the virtue of patience, and, most\r\nof all, inculcated the necessity of wariness in conducting any covert\r\nassault on the Indians. Once he thought he heard the cracking of a\r\ndried twig, but expectation was so intense it might mislead him. In this\r\nmanner minute after minute passed, until the whole time since he left\r\nhis companions was extended to quite an hour. Deerslayer knew not\r\nwhether to rejoice in or to mourn over this cautious delay, for, if\r\nit augured security to his associates, it foretold destruction to the\r\nfeeble and innocent.\r\n\r\nIt might have been an hour and a half after his companions and he had\r\nparted, when Deerslayer was aroused by a sound that filled him equally\r\nwith concern and surprise. The quavering call of a loon arose from\r\nthe opposite side of the lake, evidently at no great distance from\r\nits outlet. There was no mistaking the note of this bird, which is\r\nso familiar to all who know the sounds of the American lakes. Shrill,\r\ntremulous, loud, and sufficiently prolonged, it seems the very cry of\r\nwarning. It is often raised, also, at night, an exception to the habits\r\nof most of the other feathered inmates of the wilderness; a circumstance\r\nwhich had induced Hurry to select it as his own signal. There had been\r\nsufficient time, certainly, for the two adventurers to make their way by\r\nland from the point where they had been left to that whence the call had\r\ncome, but it was not probable that they would adopt such a course. Had\r\nthe camp been deserted they would have summoned Deerslayer to the shore,\r\nand, did it prove to be peopled, there could be no sufficient motive\r\nfor circling it, in order to re-embark at so great a distance. Should he\r\nobey the signal, and be drawn away from the landing, the lives of those\r\nwho depended on him might be the forfeit--and, should he neglect the\r\ncall, on the supposition that it had been really made, the consequences\r\nmight be equally disastrous, though from a different cause. In this\r\nindecision he waited, trusting that the call, whether feigned or\r\nnatural, would be speedily renewed. Nor was he mistaken. A very few\r\nminutes elapsed before the same shrill warning cry was repeated, and\r\nfrom the same part of the lake. This time, being on the alert, his\r\nsenses were not deceived. Although he had often heard admirable\r\nimitations of this bird, and was no mean adept himself in raising its\r\nnotes, he felt satisfied that Hurry, to whose efforts in that way he\r\nhad attended, could never so completely and closely follow nature. He\r\ndetermined, therefore, to disregard that cry, and to wait for one less\r\nperfect and nearer at hand.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had hardly come to this determination, when the profound\r\nstillness of night and solitude was broken by a cry so startling, as to\r\ndrive all recollection of the more melancholy call of the loon from the\r\nlistener\'s mind. It was a shriek of agony, that came either from one\r\nof the female sex, or from a boy so young as not yet to have attained a\r\nmanly voice. This appeal could not be mistaken. Heart rending terror--if\r\nnot writhing agony--was in the sounds, and the anguish that had awakened\r\nthem was as sudden as it was fearful. The young man released his hold\r\nof the rush, and dashed his paddle into the water; to do, he knew\r\nnot what--to steer, he knew not whither. A very few moments, however,\r\nremoved his indecision. The breaking of branches, the cracking of\r\ndried sticks, and the fall of feet were distinctly audible; the\r\nsounds appearing to approach the water though in a direction that led\r\ndiagonally towards the shore, and a little farther north than the spot\r\nthat Deerslayer had been ordered to keep near. Following this clue,\r\nthe young man urged the canoe ahead, paying but little attention to the\r\nmanner in which he might betray its presence. He had reached a part of\r\nthe shore, where its immediate bank was tolerably high and quite steep.\r\nMen were evidently threshing through the bushes and trees on the summit\r\nof this bank, following the line of the shore, as if those who fled\r\nsought a favorable place for descending. Just at this instant five or\r\nsix rifles flashed, and the opposite hills gave back, as usual, the\r\nsharp reports in prolonged rolling echoes. One or two shrieks, like\r\nthose which escape the bravest when suddenly overcome by unexpected\r\nanguish and alarm, followed; and then the threshing among the bushes was\r\nrenewed, in a way to show that man was grappling with man.\r\n\r\n"Slippery devil!" shouted Hurry with the fury of disappointment--"his\r\nskin\'s greased! I sha\'n\'t grapple! Take that for your cunning!"\r\n\r\nThe words were followed by the fall of some heavy object among the\r\nsmaller trees that fringed the bank, appearing to Deerslayer as if his\r\ngigantic associate had hurled an enemy from him in this unceremonious\r\nmanner. Again the flight and pursuit were renewed, and then the young\r\nman saw a human form break down the hill, and rush several yards into\r\nthe water. At this critical moment the canoe was just near enough to the\r\nspot to allow this movement, which was accompanied by no little noise,\r\nto be seen, and feeling that there he must take in his companion, if\r\nanywhere, Deerslayer urged the canoe forward to the rescue. His paddle\r\nhad not been raised twice, when the voice of Hurry was heard filling\r\nthe air with imprecations, and he rolled on the narrow beach, literally\r\nloaded down with enemies. While prostrate, and almost smothered with\r\nhis foes, the athletic frontierman gave his loon-call, in a manner\r\nthat would have excited laughter under circumstances less terrific. The\r\nfigure in the water seemed suddenly to repent his own flight, and\r\nrushed to the shore to aid his companion, but was met and immediately\r\noverpowered by half a dozen fresh pursuers, who, just then, came leaping\r\ndown the bank.\r\n\r\n"Let up, you painted riptyles--let up!" cried Hurry, too hard pressed to\r\nbe particular about the terms he used; "isn\'t it enough that I am withed\r\nlike a saw-log that ye must choke too!"\r\n\r\nThis speech satisfied Deerslayer that his friends were prisoners,\r\nand that to land would be to share their fate. He was already within a\r\nhundred feet of the shore, when a few timely strokes of the paddle not\r\nonly arrested his advance, but forced him off to six or eight times\r\nthat distance from his enemies. Luckily for him, all of the Indians had\r\ndropped their rifles in the pursuit, or this retreat might not have been\r\neffected with impunity; though no one had noted the canoe in the first\r\nconfusion of the melee.\r\n\r\n"Keep off the land, lad," called out Hutter; "the girls depend only on\r\nyou, now; you will want all your caution to escape these savages. Keep\r\noff, and God prosper you, as you aid my children!"\r\n\r\nThere was little sympathy in general between Hutter and the young man,\r\nbut the bodily and mental anguish with which this appeal was made served\r\nat the moment to conceal from the latter the former\'s faults. He saw\r\nonly the father in his sufferings, and resolved at once to give a pledge\r\nof fidelity to its interests, and to be faithful to his word.\r\n\r\n"Put your heart at ease, Master Hutter," he called out; "the gals shall\r\nbe looked to, as well as the castle. The inimy has got the shore, \'tis\r\nno use to deny, but he hasn\'t got the water. Providence has the charge\r\nof all, and no one can say what will come of it; but, if good-will can\r\nsarve you and your\'n, depend on that much. My exper\'ence is small, but\r\nmy will is good."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, Deerslayer," returned Hurry, in this stentorian voice,\r\nwhich was losing some of its heartiness, notwithstanding,--"Ay, ay,\r\nDeerslayer. You mean well enough, but what can you do? You\'re no great\r\nmatter in the best of times, and such a person is not likely to turn\r\nout a miracle in the worst. If there\'s one savage on this lake shore,\r\nthere\'s forty, and that\'s an army you ar\'n\'t the man to overcome. The\r\nbest way, in my judgment, will be to make a straight course to the\r\ncastle; get the gals into the canoe, with a few eatables; then strike\r\noff for the corner of the lake where we came in, and take the best trail\r\nfor the Mohawk. These devils won\'t know where to look for you for some\r\nhours, and if they did, and went off hot in the pursuit, they must\r\nturn either the foot or the head of the lake to get at you. That\'s my\r\njudgment in the matter; and if old Tom here wishes to make his last will\r\nand testament in a manner favorable to his darters, he\'ll say the same."\r\n\r\n"\'Twill never do, young man," rejoined Hutter. "The enemy has scouts out\r\nat this moment, looking for canoes, and you\'ll be seen and taken. Trust\r\nto the castle; and above all things, keep clear of the land. Hold out a\r\nweek, and parties from the garrisons will drive the savages off."\r\n\r\n"\'Twon\'t be four-and-twenty hours, old fellow, afore these foxes will be\r\nrafting off to storm your castle," interrupted Hurry, with more of the\r\nheat of argument than might be expected from a man who was bound and a\r\ncaptive, and about whom nothing could be called free but his opinions\r\nand his tongue. "Your advice has a stout sound, but it will have a fatal\r\ntarmination. If you or I was in the house, we might hold out a few days,\r\nbut remember that this lad has never seen an inimy afore to-night, and is\r\nwhat you yourself called settlement-conscienced; though for my part, I\r\nthink the consciences in the settlements pretty much the same as they\r\nare out here in the woods. These savages are making signs, Deerslayer,\r\nfor me to encourage you to come ashore with the canoe; but that I\'ll\r\nnever do, as it\'s ag\'in reason and natur\'. As for old Tom and myself,\r\nwhether they\'ll scalp us to-night, keep us for the torture by fire,\r\nor carry us to Canada, is more than any one knows but the devil that\r\nadvises them how to act. I\'ve such a big and bushy head that it\'s quite\r\nlikely they\'ll indivor to get two scalps off it, for the bounty is a\r\ntempting thing, or old Tom and I wouldn\'t be in this scrape. Ay--there\r\nthey go with their signs ag\'in, but if I advise you to land may they eat\r\nme as well as roast me. No, no, Deerslayer--do you keep off where you\r\nare, and after daylight, on no account come within two hundred yards--"\r\n\r\nThis injunction of Hurry\'s was stopped by a hand being rudely slapped\r\nagainst his mouth, the certain sign that some one in the party\r\nsufficiently understood English to have at length detected the drift of\r\nhis discourse. Immediately after, the whole group entered the forest,\r\nHutter and Hurry apparently making no resistance to the movement. Just\r\nas the sounds of the cracking bushes were ceasing, however, the voice of\r\nthe father was again heard.\r\n\r\n"As you\'re true to my children, God prosper you, young man!" were the\r\nwords that reached Deerslayer\'s ears; after which he found himself left\r\nto follow the dictates of his own discretion.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes elapsed, in death-like stillness, when the party on the\r\nshore had disappeared in the woods. Owing to the distance--rather more\r\nthan two hundred yards--and the obscurity, Deerslayer had been able\r\nbarely to distinguish the group, and to see it retiring; but even this\r\ndim connection with human forms gave an animation to the scene that was\r\nstrongly in contrast to the absolute solitude that remained. Although\r\nthe young man leaned forward to listen, holding his breath and\r\ncondensing every faculty in the single sense of hearing, not another\r\nsound reached his ears to denote the vicinity of human beings. It seemed\r\nas if a silence that had never been broken reigned on the spot again;\r\nand, for an instant, even that piercing shriek, which had so lately\r\nbroken the stillness of the forest, or the execrations of March, would\r\nhave been a relief to the feeling of desertion to which it gave rise.\r\n\r\nThis paralysis of mind and body, however, could not last long in one\r\nconstituted mentally and physically like Deerslayer. Dropping his paddle\r\ninto the water, he turned the head of the canoe, and proceeded slowly,\r\nas one walks who thinks intently, towards the centre of the lake. When\r\nhe believed himself to have reached a point in a line with that where\r\nhe had set the last canoe adrift, he changed his direction northward,\r\nkeeping the light air as nearly on his back as possible. After paddling\r\na quarter of a mile in this direction, a dark object became visible\r\non the lake, a little to the right; and turning on one side for the\r\npurpose, he had soon secured his lost prize to his own boat. Deerslayer\r\nnow examined the heavens, the course of the air, and the position of the\r\ntwo canoes. Finding nothing in either to induce a change of plan, he lay\r\ndown, and prepared to catch a few hours\' sleep, that the morrow might\r\nfind him equal to its exigencies.\r\n\r\nAlthough the hardy and the tired sleep profoundly, even in scenes of\r\ndanger, it was some time before Deerslayer lost his recollection. His\r\nmind dwelt on what had passed, and his half-conscious faculties kept\r\nfiguring the events of the night, in a sort of waking dream. Suddenly\r\nhe was up and alert, for he fancied he heard the preconcerted signal of\r\nHurry summoning him to the shore. But all was still as the grave again.\r\nThe canoes were slowly drifting northward, the thoughtful stars were\r\nglimmering in their mild glory over his head, and the forest-bound sheet\r\nof water lay embedded between its mountains, as calm and melancholy as\r\nif never troubled by the winds, or brightened by a noonday sun. Once\r\nmore the loon raised his tremulous cry, near the foot of the lake, and\r\nthe mystery of the alarm was explained. Deerslayer adjusted his hard\r\npillow, stretched his form in the bottom of the canoe, and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Clear, placid Leman I Thy contrasted lake\r\n    With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing\r\n    Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\r\n    Earth\'s troubled waters for a purer spring.\r\n    This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\r\n    To waft me from distraction; once I loved\r\n    Torn ocean\'s roar, but thy soft murmuring\r\n    Sounds sweet as if a sister\'s voice reproved,\r\n    That I with stern delights should e\'er have been so moved."\r\n\r\n    BYRON.\r\n\r\nDay had fairly dawned before the young man, whom we have left in the\r\nsituation described in the last chapter, again opened his eyes. This\r\nwas no sooner done, than he started up, and looked about him with\r\nthe eagerness of one who suddenly felt the importance of accurately\r\nascertaining his precise position. His rest had been deep and\r\nundisturbed; and when he awoke, it was with a clearness of intellect and\r\na readiness of resources that were very much needed at that particular\r\nmoment. The sun had not risen, it is true, but the vault of heaven was\r\nrich with the winning softness that "brings and shuts the day," while\r\nthe whole air was filled with the carols of birds, the hymns of the\r\nfeathered tribe. These sounds first told Deerslayer the risks he ran.\r\nThe air, for wind it could scarce be called, was still light, it is\r\ntrue, but it had increased a little in the course of the night, and\r\nas the canoes were feathers on the water, they had drifted twice the\r\nexpected distance; and, what was still more dangerous, had approached\r\nso near the base of the mountain that here rose precipitously from the\r\neastern shore, as to render the carols of the birds plainly audible.\r\nThis was not the worst. The third canoe had taken the same direction,\r\nand was slowly drifting towards a point where it must inevitably\r\ntouch, unless turned aside by a shift of wind, or human hands. In other\r\nrespects, nothing presented itself to attract attention, or to awaken\r\nalarm. The castle stood on its shoal, nearly abreast of the canoes, for\r\nthe drift had amounted to miles in the course of the night, and the ark\r\nlay fastened to its piles, as both had been left so many hours before.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, Deerslayer\'s attention was first given to the\r\ncanoe ahead. It was already quite near the point, and a very few strokes\r\nof the paddle sufficed to tell him that it must touch before he could\r\npossibly overtake it. Just at this moment, too, the wind inopportunely\r\nfreshened, rendering the drift of the light craft much more rapid than\r\ncertain. Feeling the impossibility of preventing a contact with\r\nthe land, the young man wisely determined not to heat himself with\r\nunnecessary exertions; but first looking to the priming of his piece,\r\nhe proceeded slowly and warily towards the point, taking care to make\r\na little circuit, that he might be exposed on only one side, as he\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nThe canoe adrift being directed by no such intelligence, pursued its\r\nproper way, and grounded on a small sunken rock, at the distance of\r\nthree or four yards from the shore. Just at that moment, Deerslayer had\r\ngot abreast of the point, and turned the bows of his own boat to\r\nthe land; first casting loose his tow, that his movements might be\r\nunencumbered. The canoe hung an instant to the rock; then it rose a\r\nhair\'s breadth on an almost imperceptible swell of the water, swung\r\nround, floated clear, and reached the strand. All this the young man\r\nnoted, but it neither quickened his pulses, nor hastened his hand. If\r\nany one had been lying in wait for the arrival of the waif, he must\r\nbe seen, and the utmost caution in approaching the shore became\r\nindispensable; if no one was in ambush, hurry was unnecessary. The point\r\nbeing nearly diagonally opposite to the Indian encampment, he hoped the\r\nlast, though the former was not only possible, but probable; for the\r\nsavages were prompt in adopting all the expedients of their particular\r\nmodes of warfare, and quite likely had many scouts searching the shores\r\nfor craft to carry them off to the castle. As a glance at the lake\r\nfrom any height or projection would expose the smallest object on its\r\nsurface, there was little hope that either of the canoes would pass\r\nunseen; and Indian sagacity needed no instruction to tell which way a\r\nboat or a log would drift, when the direction of the wind was known. As\r\nDeerslayer drew nearer and nearer to the land, the stroke of his paddle\r\ngrew slower, his eye became more watchful, and his ears and nostrils\r\nalmost dilated with the effort to detect any lurking danger. It was a\r\ntrying moment for a novice, nor was there the encouragement which\r\neven the timid sometimes feel, when conscious of being observed and\r\ncommended. He was entirely alone, thrown on his own resources, and\r\nwas cheered by no friendly eye, emboldened by no encouraging voice.\r\nNotwithstanding all these circumstances, the most experienced veteran\r\nin forest warfare could not have behaved better. Equally free from\r\nrecklessness and hesitation, his advance was marked by a sort of\r\nphilosophical prudence that appeared to render him superior to all\r\nmotives but those which were best calculated to effect his purpose. Such\r\nwas the commencement of a career in forest exploits, that afterwards\r\nrendered this man, in his way, and under the limits of his habits and\r\nopportunities, as renowned as many a hero whose name has adorned the\r\npages of works more celebrated than legends simple as ours can ever\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nWhen about a hundred yards from the shore, Deerslayer rose in the canoe,\r\ngave three or four vigorous strokes with the paddle, sufficient of\r\nthemselves to impel the bark to land, and then quickly laying aside the\r\ninstrument of labor, he seized that of war. He was in the very act of\r\nraising the rifle, when a sharp report was followed by the buzz of a\r\nbullet that passed so near his body as to cause him involuntarily to\r\nstart. The next instant Deerslayer staggered, and fell his whole\r\nlength in the bottom of the canoe. A yell--it came from a single\r\nvoice--followed, and an Indian leaped from the bushes upon the open area\r\nof the point, bounding towards the canoe. This was the moment the young\r\nman desired. He rose on the instant, and levelled his own rifle at his\r\nuncovered foe; but his finger hesitated about pulling the trigger on one\r\nwhom he held at such a disadvantage. This little delay, probably, saved\r\nthe life of the Indian, who bounded back into the cover as swiftly as\r\nhe had broken out of it. In the meantime Deerslayer had been swiftly\r\napproaching the land, and his own canoe reached the point just as his\r\nenemy disappeared. As its movements had not been directed, it touched\r\nthe shore a few yards from the other boat; and though the rifle of his\r\nfoe had to be loaded, there was not time to secure his prize, and carry\r\nit beyond danger, before he would be exposed to another shot. Under the\r\ncircumstances, therefore, he did not pause an instant, but dashed into\r\nthe woods and sought a cover.\r\n\r\nOn the immediate point there was a small open area, partly in native\r\ngrass, and partly beach, but a dense fringe of bushes lined its\r\nupper side. This narrow belt of dwarf vegetation passed, one issued\r\nimmediately into the high and gloomy vaults of the forest. The land was\r\ntolerably level for a few hundred feet, and then it rose precipitously\r\nin a mountainside. The trees were tall, large, and so free from\r\nunderbrush, that they resembled vast columns, irregularly scattered,\r\nupholding a dome of leaves. Although they stood tolerably close\r\ntogether, for their ages and size, the eye could penetrate to\r\nconsiderable distances; and bodies of men, even, might have engaged\r\nbeneath their cover, with concert and intelligence.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer knew that his adversary must be employed in reloading, unless\r\nhe had fled. The former proved to be the case, for the young man had no\r\nsooner placed himself behind a tree, than he caught a glimpse of the arm\r\nof the Indian, his body being concealed by an oak, in the very act of\r\nforcing the leathered bullet home. Nothing would have been easier than\r\nto spring forward, and decide the affair by a close assault on his\r\nunprepared foe; but every feeling of Deerslayer revolted at such a step,\r\nalthough his own life had just been attempted from a cover. He was yet\r\nunpracticed in the ruthless expedients of savage warfare, of which he\r\nknew nothing except by tradition and theory, and it struck him as unfair\r\nadvantage to assail an unarmed foe. His color had heightened, his eye\r\nfrowned, his lips were compressed, and all his energies were collected\r\nand ready; but, instead of advancing to fire, he dropped his rifle to\r\nthe usual position of a sportsman in readiness to catch his aim, and\r\nmuttered to himself, unconscious that he was speaking--\r\n\r\n"No, no--that may be red-skin warfare, but it\'s not a Christian\'s gifts.\r\nLet the miscreant charge, and then we\'ll take it out like men; for the\r\ncanoe he must not, and shall not have. No, no; let him have time to\r\nload, and God will take care of the right!"\r\n\r\nAll this time the Indian had been so intent on his own movements,\r\nthat he was even ignorant that his enemy was in the woods. His only\r\napprehension was, that the canoe would be recovered and carried away\r\nbefore he might be in readiness to prevent it. He had sought the cover\r\nfrom habit, but was within a few feet of the fringe of bushes, and could\r\nbe at the margin of the forest in readiness to fire in a moment. The\r\ndistance between him and his enemy was about fifty yards, and the trees\r\nwere so arranged by nature that the line of sight was not interrupted,\r\nexcept by the particular trees behind which each party stood.\r\n\r\nHis rifle was no sooner loaded, than the savage glanced around him, and\r\nadvanced incautiously as regarded the real, but stealthily as respected\r\nthe fancied position of his enemy, until he was fairly exposed. Then\r\nDeerslayer stepped from behind its own cover, and hailed him.\r\n\r\n"This-a-way, red-skin; this-a-way, if you\'re looking for me," he called\r\nout. "I\'m young in war, but not so young as to stand on an open beach to\r\nbe shot down like an owl, by daylight. It rests on yourself whether it\'s\r\npeace or war atween us; for my gifts are white gifts, and I\'m not one\r\nof them that thinks it valiant to slay human mortals, singly, in the\r\nwoods."\r\n\r\nThe savage was a good deal startled by this sudden discovery of the\r\ndanger he ran. He had a little knowledge of English, however, and caught\r\nthe drift of the other\'s meaning. He was also too well schooled to\r\nbetray alarm, but, dropping the butt of his rifle to the earth, with\r\nan air of confidence, he made a gesture of lofty courtesy. All this was\r\ndone with the ease and self-possession of one accustomed to consider no\r\nman his superior. In the midst of this consummate acting, however, the\r\nvolcano that raged within caused his eyes to glare, and his nostrils to\r\ndilate, like those of some wild beast that is suddenly prevented from\r\ntaking the fatal leap.\r\n\r\n"Two canoes," he said, in the deep guttural tones of his race, holding\r\nup the number of fingers he mentioned, by way of preventing mistakes;\r\n"one for you--one for me."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Mingo, that will never do. You own neither; and neither shall\r\nyou have, as long as I can prevent it. I know it\'s war atween your\r\npeople and mine, but that\'s no reason why human mortals should slay each\r\nother, like savage creatur\'s that meet in the woods; go your way, then,\r\nand leave me to go mine. The world is large enough for us both; and when\r\nwe meet fairly in battle, why, the Lord will order the fate of each of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Good!" exclaimed the Indian; "my brother missionary--great talk; all\r\nabout Manitou."\r\n\r\n"Not so--not so, warrior. I\'m not good enough for the Moravians, and am\r\ntoo good for most of the other vagabonds that preach about in the woods.\r\nNo, no; I\'m only a hunter, as yet, though afore the peace is made,\r\n\'tis like enough there\'ll be occasion to strike a blow at some of your\r\npeople. Still, I wish it to be done in fair fight, and not in a quarrel\r\nabout the ownership of a miserable canoe."\r\n\r\n"Good! My brother very young--but he is very wise. Little warrior--great\r\ntalker. Chief, sometimes, in council."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know this, nor do I say it, Injin," returned Deerslayer,\r\ncoloring a little at the ill-concealed sarcasm of the other\'s manner;\r\n"I look forward to a life in the woods, and I only hope it may be a\r\npeaceable one. All young men must go on the war-path, when there\'s\r\noccasion, but war isn\'t needfully massacre. I\'ve seen enough of the\r\nlast, this very night, to know that Providence frowns on it; and I now\r\ninvite you to go your own way, while I go mine; and hope that we may\r\npart fri\'nds."\r\n\r\n"Good! My brother has two scalp--gray hair under \'other. Old\r\nwisdom--young tongue."\r\n\r\nHere the savage advanced with confidence, his hand extended, his face\r\nsmiling, and his whole bearing denoting amity and respect. Deerslayer\r\nmet his offered friendship in a proper spirit, and they shook hands\r\ncordially, each endeavoring to assure the other of his sincerity and\r\ndesire to be at peace.\r\n\r\n"All have his own," said the Indian; "my canoe, mine; your canoe,\r\nyour\'n. Go look; if your\'n, you keep; if mine, I keep."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just, red-skin; thought you must be wrong in thinking the canoe\r\nyour property. Howsever, seein\' is believin\', and we\'ll go down to the\r\nshore, where you may look with your own eyes; for it\'s likely you\'ll\r\nobject to trustin\' altogether to mine."\r\n\r\nThe Indian uttered his favorite exclamation of "Good!" and then they\r\nwalked side by side, towards the shore. There was no apparent distrust\r\nin the manner of either, the Indian moving in advance, as if he wished\r\nto show his companion that he did not fear turning his back to him. As\r\nthey reached the open ground, the former pointed towards Deerslayer\'s\r\nboat, and said emphatically--"No mine--pale-face canoe. This red man\'s.\r\nNo want other man\'s canoe--want his own."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong, red-skin, you\'re altogether wrong. This canoe was left\r\nin old Hutter\'s keeping, and is his\'n according to law, red or white,\r\ntill its owner comes to claim it. Here\'s the seats and the stitching of\r\nthe bark to speak for themselves. No man ever know\'d an Injin to turn\r\noff such work."\r\n\r\n"Good! My brother little old--big wisdom. Injin no make him. White man\'s\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you think so, for holding out to the contrary might have made\r\nill blood atween us, every one having a right to take possession of his\r\nown. I\'ll just shove the canoe out of reach of dispute at once, as the\r\nquickest way of settling difficulties."\r\n\r\nWhile Deerslayer was speaking, he put a foot against the end of the\r\nlight boat, and giving a vigorous shove, he sent it out into the lake\r\na hundred feet or more, where, taking the true current, it would\r\nnecessarily float past the point, and be in no further danger of coming\r\nashore. The savage started at this ready and decided expedient, and his\r\ncompanion saw that he cast a hurried and fierce glance at his own canoe,\r\nor that which contained the paddles. The change of manner, however, was\r\nbut momentary, and then the Iroquois resumed his air of friendliness,\r\nand a smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he repeated, with stronger emphasis than ever. "Young head, old\r\nmind. Know how to settle quarrel. Farewell, brother. He go to house in\r\nwater--muskrat house--Injin go to camp; tell chiefs no find canoe."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer was not sorry to hear this proposal, for he felt anxious\r\nto join the females, and he took the offered hand of the Indian very\r\nwillingly. The parting words were friendly, and while the red man\r\nwalked calmly towards the wood, with the rifle in the hollow of his arm,\r\nwithout once looking back in uneasiness or distrust, the white man moved\r\ntowards the remaining canoe, carrying his piece in the same pacific\r\nmanner, it is true, but keeping his eye fastened on the movements of the\r\nother. This distrust, however, seemed to be altogether uncalled for, and\r\nas if ashamed to have entertained it, the young man averted his look,\r\nand stepped carelessly up to his boat. Here he began to push the canoe\r\nfrom the shore, and to make his other preparations for departing. He\r\nmight have been thus employed a minute, when, happening to turn his face\r\ntowards the land, his quick and certain eye told him, at a glance, the\r\nimminent jeopardy in which his life was placed. The black, ferocious\r\neyes of the savage were glancing on him, like those of the crouching\r\ntiger, through a small opening in the bushes, and the muzzle of his\r\nrifle seemed already to be opening in a line with his own body.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, the long practice of Deerslayer, as a hunter did him good\r\nservice. Accustomed to fire with the deer on the bound, and often when\r\nthe precise position of the animal\'s body had in a manner to be guessed\r\nat, he used the same expedients here. To cock and poise his rifle were\r\nthe acts of a single moment and a single motion: then aiming almost\r\nwithout sighting, he fired into the bushes where he knew a body ought\r\nto be, in order to sustain the appalling countenance which alone was\r\nvisible. There was not time to raise the piece any higher, or to take\r\na more deliberate aim. So rapid were his movements that both parties\r\ndischarged their pieces at the same instant, the concussions mingling\r\nin one report. The mountains, indeed, gave back but a single echo.\r\nDeerslayer dropped his piece, and stood with head erect, steady as one\r\nof the pines in the calm of a June morning, watching the result; while\r\nthe savage gave the yell that has become historical for its appalling\r\ninfluence, leaped through the bushes, and came bounding across the open\r\nground, flourishing a tomahawk. Still Deerslayer moved not, but stood\r\nwith his unloaded rifle fallen against his shoulders, while, with a\r\nhunter\'s habits, his hands were mechanically feeling for the powder-horn\r\nand charger. When about forty feet from his enemy, the savage hurled his\r\nkeen weapon; but it was with an eye so vacant, and a hand so unsteady\r\nand feeble, that the young man caught it by the handle as it was flying\r\npast him. At that instant the Indian staggered and fell his whole length\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n"I know\'d it--I know\'d it!" exclaimed Deerslayer, who was already\r\npreparing to force a fresh bullet into his rifle; "I know\'d it must come\r\nto this, as soon as I had got the range from the creatur\'s eyes. A man\r\nsights suddenly, and fires quick when his own life\'s in danger; yes, I\r\nknow\'d it would come to this. I was about the hundredth part of a second\r\ntoo quick for him, or it might have been bad for me! The riptyle\'s\r\nbullet has just grazed my side--but say what you will for or ag\'in \'em,\r\na red-skin is by no means as sartain with powder and ball as a white\r\nman. Their gifts don\'t seem to lie that a way. Even Chingachgook, great\r\nas he is in other matters, isn\'t downright deadly with the rifle."\r\n\r\nBy this time the piece was reloaded, and Deerslayer, after tossing the\r\ntomahawk into the canoe, advanced to his victim, and stood over him,\r\nleaning on his rifle, in melancholy attention. It was the first\r\ninstance in which he had seen a man fall in battle--it was the first\r\nfellow-creature against whom he had ever seriously raised his own hand.\r\nThe sensations were novel; and regret, with the freshness of our better\r\nfeelings, mingled with his triumph. The Indian was not dead, though shot\r\ndirectly through the body. He lay on his back motionless, but his eyes,\r\nnow full of consciousness, watched each action of his victor--as the\r\nfallen bird regards the fowler--jealous of every movement. The man\r\nprobably expected the fatal blow which was to precede the loss of his\r\nscalp; or perhaps he anticipated that this latter act of cruelty\r\nwould precede his death. Deerslayer read his thoughts; and he found a\r\nmelancholy satisfaction in relieving the apprehensions of the helpless\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\n"No, no, red-skin," he said; "you\'ve nothing more to fear from me. I am\r\nof a Christian stock, and scalping is not of my gifts. I\'ll just make\r\nsartain of your rifle, and then come back and do you what sarvice I can.\r\nThough here I can\'t stay much longer, as the crack of three rifles will\r\nbe apt to bring some of your devils down upon me."\r\n\r\nThe close of this was said in a sort of a soliloquy, as the young man\r\nwent in quest of the fallen rifle. The piece was found where its owner\r\nhad dropped it, and was immediately put into the canoe. Laying his own\r\nrifle at its side, Deerslayer then returned and stood over the Indian\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"All inmity atween you and me\'s at an ind red-skin," he said; "and you\r\nmay set your heart at rest on the score of the scalp, or any further\r\ninjury. My gifts are white, as I\'ve told you; and I hope my conduct will\r\nbe white also."\r\n\r\nCould looks have conveyed all they meant, it is probable Deerslayer\'s\r\ninnocent vanity on the subject of color would have been rebuked a\r\nlittle; but he comprehended the gratitude that was expressed in the eyes\r\nof the dying savage, without in the least detecting the bitter sarcasm\r\nthat struggled with the better feeling.\r\n\r\n"Water!" ejaculated the thirsty and unfortunate creature; "give poor\r\nInjin water."\r\n\r\n"Ay, water you shall have, if you drink the lake dry. I\'ll just carry\r\nyou down to it that you may take your fill. This is the way, they\r\ntell me, with all wounded people--water is their greatest comfort and\r\ndelight."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Deerslayer raised the Indian in his arms, and carried him to\r\nthe lake. Here he first helped him to take an attitude in which he could\r\nappease his burning thirst; after which he seated himself on a\r\nstone, and took the head of his wounded adversary in his own lap, and\r\nendeavored to soothe his anguish in the best manner he could.\r\n\r\n"It would be sinful in me to tell you your time hadn\'t come, warrior,"\r\nhe commenced, "and therefore I\'ll not say it. You\'ve passed the middle\r\nage already, and, considerin\' the sort of lives ye lead, your days have\r\nbeen pretty well filled. The principal thing now, is to look forward\r\nto what comes next. Neither red-skin nor pale-face, on the whole,\r\ncalculates much on sleepin\' forever; but both expect to live in another\r\nworld. Each has his gifts, and will be judged by \'em, and I suppose\r\nyou\'ve thought these matters over enough not to stand in need of sarmons\r\nwhen the trial comes. You\'ll find your happy hunting-grounds, if you\'ve\r\nbeen a just Injin; if an onjust, you\'ll meet your desarts in another\r\nway. I\'ve my own idees about these things; but you\'re too old and\r\nexper\'enced to need any explanations from one as young as I."\r\n\r\n"Good!" ejaculated the Indian, whose voice retained its depth even as\r\nlife ebbed away; "young head--old wisdom!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s sometimes a consolation, when the ind comes, to know that them\r\nwe\'ve harmed, or tried to harm, forgive us. I suppose natur\' seeks\r\nthis relief, by way of getting a pardon on \'arth; as we never can know\r\nwhether He pardons, who is all in all, till judgment itself comes. It\'s\r\nsoothing to know that any pardon at such times; and that, I conclude, is\r\nthe secret. Now, as for myself, I overlook altogether your designs ag\'in\r\nmy life; first, because no harm came of \'em; next, because it\'s your\r\ngifts, and natur\', and trainin\', and I ought not to have trusted you at\r\nall; and, finally and chiefly, because I can bear no ill-will to a dying\r\nman, whether heathen or Christian. So put your heart at ease, so far as\r\nI\'m consarned; you know best what other matters ought to trouble you, or\r\nwhat ought to give you satisfaction in so trying a moment."\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Indian had some of the fearful glimpses of the\r\nunknown state of being which God, in mercy, seems at times to afford\r\nto all the human race; but they were necessarily in conformity with his\r\nhabits and prejudices. Like most of his people, and like too many of our\r\nown, he thought more of dying in a way to gain applause among those\r\nhe left than to secure a better state of existence hereafter. While\r\nDeerslayer was speaking, his mind was a little bewildered, though he\r\nfelt that the intention was good; and when he had done, a regret passed\r\nover his spirit that none of his own tribe were present to witness his\r\nstoicism, under extreme bodily suffering, and the firmness with which he\r\nmet his end. With the high innate courtesy that so often distinguishes\r\nthe Indian warrior before he becomes corrupted by too much intercourse\r\nwith the worst class of the white men, he endeavored to express his\r\nthankfulness for the other\'s good intentions, and to let him understand\r\nthat they were appreciated.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he repeated, for this was an English word much used by the\r\nsavages, "good! young head; young heart, too. Old heart tough; no shed\r\ntear. Hear Indian when he die, and no want to lie--what he call him?"\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer is the name I bear now, though the Delawares have said that\r\nwhen I get back from this war-path, I shall have a more manly title,\r\nprovided I can \'arn one."\r\n\r\n"That good name for boy--poor name for warrior. He get better quick.\r\nNo fear there,"--the savage had strength sufficient, under the strong\r\nexcitement he felt, to raise a hand and tap the young man on his\r\nbreast,--"eye sartain--finger lightning--aim, death--great warrior soon.\r\nNo Deerslayer--Hawkeye--Hawkeye--Hawkeye. Shake hand."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer--or Hawkeye, as the youth was then first named, for in after\r\nyears he bore the appellation throughout all that region--Deerslayer\r\ntook the hand of the savage, whose last breath was drawn in that\r\nattitude, gazing in admiration at the countenance of a stranger, who\r\nhad shown so much readiness, skill, and firmness, in a scene that was\r\nequally trying and novel. When the reader remembers it is the highest\r\ngratification an Indian can receive to see his enemy betray weakness,\r\nhe will be better able to appreciate the conduct which had extorted so\r\ngreat a concession at such a moment.\r\n\r\n"His spirit has fled!" said Deerslayer, in a suppressed, melancholy\r\nvoice. "Ah\'s me! Well, to this we must all come, sooner or later; and\r\nhe is happiest, let his skin be what color it may, who is best fitted to\r\nmeet it. Here lies the body of no doubt a brave warrior, and the soul\r\nis already flying towards its heaven or hell, whether that be a happy\r\nhunting ground, a place scant of game, regions of glory, according to\r\nMoravian doctrine, or flames of fire! So it happens, too, as regards\r\nother matters! Here have old Hutter and Hurry Harry got themselves into\r\ndifficulty, if they haven\'t got themselves into torment and death,\r\nand all for a bounty that luck offers to me in what many would think a\r\nlawful and suitable manner. But not a farthing of such money shall cross\r\nmy hand. White I was born, and white will I die; clinging to color to\r\nthe last, even though the King\'s majesty, his governors, and all his\r\ncouncils, both at home and in the colonies, forget from what they come,\r\nand where they hope to go, and all for a little advantage in warfare.\r\nNo, no, warrior, hand of mine shall never molest your scalp, and so your\r\nsoul may rest in peace on the p\'int of making a decent appearance when\r\nthe body comes to join it, in your own land of spirits."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer arose as soon as he had spoken. Then he placed the body of\r\nthe dead man in a sitting posture, with its back against the little\r\nrock, taking the necessary care to prevent it from falling or in any\r\nway settling into an attitude that might be thought unseemly by\r\nthe sensitive, though wild notions of a savage. When this duty was\r\nperformed, the young man stood gazing at the grim countenance of his\r\nfallen foe, in a sort of melancholy abstraction. As was his practice,\r\nhowever, a habit gained by living so much alone in the forest, he then\r\nbegan again to give utterance to his thoughts and feelings aloud.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t wish your life, red-skin," he said "but you left me no choice\r\natween killing or being killed. Each party acted according to his\r\ngifts, I suppose, and blame can light on neither. You were treacherous,\r\naccording to your natur\' in war, and I was a little oversightful, as I\'m\r\napt to be in trusting others. Well, this is my first battle with a human\r\nmortal, though it\'s not likely to be the last. I have fou\'t most of\r\nthe creatur\'s of the forest, such as bears, wolves, painters, and\r\ncatamounts, but this is the beginning with the red-skins. If I was Injin\r\nborn, now, I might tell of this, or carry in the scalp, and boast of\r\nthe expl\'ite afore the whole tribe; or, if my inimy had only been even\r\na bear, \'twould have been nat\'ral and proper to let everybody know what\r\nhad happened; but I don\'t well see how I\'m to let even Chingachgook into\r\nthis secret, so long as it can be done only by boasting with a white\r\ntongue. And why should I wish to boast of it a\'ter all? It\'s slaying a\r\nhuman, although he was a savage; and how do I know that he was a just\r\nInjin; and that he has not been taken away suddenly to anything but\r\nhappy hunting-grounds. When it\'s onsartain whether good or evil has\r\nbeen done, the wisest way is not to be boastful--still, I should like\r\nChingachgook to know that I haven\'t discredited the Delawares, or my\r\ntraining!"\r\n\r\nPart of this was uttered aloud, while part was merely muttered between\r\nthe speaker\'s teeth; his more confident opinions enjoying the first\r\nadvantage, while his doubts were expressed in the latter mode. Soliloquy\r\nand reflection received a startling interruption, however, by the sudden\r\nappearance of a second Indian on the lake shore, a few hundred yards\r\nfrom the point. This man, evidently another scout, who had probably been\r\ndrawn to the place by the reports of the rifles, broke out of the forest\r\nwith so little caution that Deerslayer caught a view of his person\r\nbefore he was himself discovered. When the latter event did occur, as\r\nwas the case a moment later, the savage gave a loud yell, which was\r\nanswered by a dozen voices from different parts of the mountainside.\r\nThere was no longer any time for delay; in another minute the boat was\r\nquitting the shore under long and steady sweeps of the paddle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Deerslayer believed himself to be at a safe distance he\r\nceased his efforts, permitting the little bark to drift, while he\r\nleisurely took a survey of the state of things. The canoe first sent\r\nadrift was floating before the air, quite a quarter of a mile above him,\r\nand a little nearer to the shore than he wished, now that he knew more\r\nof the savages were so near at hand. The canoe shoved from the point was\r\nwithin a few yards of him, he having directed his own course towards\r\nit on quitting the land. The dead Indian lay in grim quiet where he had\r\nleft him, the warrior who had shown himself from the forest had already\r\nvanished, and the woods themselves were as silent and seemingly deserted\r\nas the day they came fresh from the hands of their great Creator. This\r\nprofound stillness, however, lasted but a moment. When time had been\r\ngiven to the scouts of the enemy to reconnoitre, they burst out of the\r\nthicket upon the naked point, filling the air with yells of fury at\r\ndiscovering the death of their companion. These cries were immediately\r\nsucceeded by shouts of delight when they reached the body and clustered\r\neagerly around it. Deerslayer was a sufficient adept in the usages of\r\nthe natives to understand the reason of the change. The yell was the\r\ncustomary lamentation at the loss of a warrior, the shout a sign of\r\nrejoicing that the conqueror had not been able to secure the scalp;\r\nthe trophy, without which a victory is never considered complete. The\r\ndistance at which the canoes lay probably prevented any attempts to\r\ninjure the conqueror, the American Indian, like the panther of his own\r\nwoods, seldom making any effort against his foe unless tolerably certain\r\nit is under circumstances that may be expected to prove effective.\r\n\r\nAs the young man had no longer any motive to remain near the point, he\r\nprepared to collect his canoes, in order to tow them off to the castle.\r\nThat nearest was soon in tow, when he proceeded in quest of the other,\r\nwhich was all this time floating up the lake. The eye of Deerslayer was\r\nno sooner fastened on this last boat, than it struck him that it was\r\nnearer to the shore than it would have been had it merely followed the\r\ncourse of the gentle current of air. He began to suspect the influence\r\nof some unseen current in the water, and he quickened his exertions, in\r\norder to regain possession of it before it could drift into a dangerous\r\nproximity to the woods. On getting nearer, he thought that the canoe had\r\na perceptible motion through the water, and, as it lay broadside to the\r\nair, that this motion was taking it towards the land. A few vigorous\r\nstrokes of the paddle carried him still nearer, when the mystery was\r\nexplained. Something was evidently in motion on the off side of the\r\ncanoe, or that which was farthest from himself, and closer scrutiny\r\nshowed that it was a naked human arm. An Indian was lying in the bottom\r\nof the canoe, and was propelling it slowly but certainly to the shore,\r\nusing his hand as a paddle. Deerslayer understood the whole artifice at\r\na glance. A savage had swum off to the boat while he was occupied with\r\nhis enemy on the point, got possession, and was using these means to\r\nurge it to the shore.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that the man in the canoe could have no arms, Deerslayer\r\ndid not hesitate to dash close alongside of the retiring boat, without\r\ndeeming it necessary to raise his own rifle. As soon as the wash of the\r\nwater, which he made in approaching, became audible to the prostrate\r\nsavage, the latter sprang to his feet, and uttered an exclamation that\r\nproved how completely he was taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve enj\'yed yourself enough in that canoe, red-skin," Deerslayer\r\ncoolly observed, stopping his own career in sufficient time to prevent\r\nan absolute collision between the two boats,--"if you\'ve enj\'yed\r\nyourself enough in that canoe, you\'ll do a prudent act by taking to the\r\nlake ag\'in. I\'m reasonable in these matters, and don\'t crave your blood,\r\nthough there\'s them about that would look upon you more as a due-bill\r\nfor the bounty than a human mortal. Take to the lake this minute, afore\r\nwe get to hot words."\r\n\r\nThe savage was one of those who did not understand a word of English,\r\nand he was indebted to the gestures of Deerslayer, and to the expression\r\nof an eye that did not often deceive, for an imperfect comprehension of\r\nhis meaning. Perhaps, too, the sight of the rifle that lay so near the\r\nhand of the white man quickened his decision. At all events, he crouched\r\nlike a tiger about to take his leap, uttered a yell, and the next\r\ninstant his naked body disappeared in the water. When he rose to take\r\nbreath, it was at the distance of several yards from the canoe, and the\r\nhasty glance he threw behind him denoted how much he feared the arrival\r\nof a fatal messenger from the rifle of his foe. But the young man made\r\nno indication of any hostile intention. Deliberately securing the canoe\r\nto the others, he began to paddle from the shore; and by the time the\r\nIndian reached the land, and had shaken himself, like a spaniel, on\r\nquitting the water, his dreaded enemy was already beyond rifle-shot on\r\nhis way to the castle. As was so much his practice, Deerslayer did not\r\nfail to soliloquize on what had just occurred, while steadily pursuing\r\nhis course towards the point of destination.\r\n\r\n"Well, well,"--he commenced,--"\'twould have been wrong to kill a human\r\nmortal without an object. Scalps are of no account with me, and life\r\nis sweet, and ought not to be taken marcilessly by them that have white\r\ngifts. The savage was a Mingo, it\'s true; and I make no doubt he is, and\r\nwill be as long as he lives, a ra\'al riptyle and vagabond; but that\'s no\r\nreason I should forget my gifts and color. No, no,--let him go; if ever\r\nwe meet ag\'in, rifle in hand, why then \'twill be seen which has the\r\nstoutest heart and the quickest eye. Hawkeye! That\'s not a bad name\r\nfor a warrior, sounding much more manful and valiant than Deerslayer!\r\n\'Twouldn\'t be a bad title to begin with, and it has been fairly \'arned.\r\nIf \'t was Chingachgook, now, he might go home and boast of his deeds,\r\nand the chiefs would name him Hawkeye in a minute; but it don\'t become\r\nwhite blood to brag, and \'t isn\'t easy to see how the matter can\r\nbe known unless I do. Well, well,--everything is in the hands of\r\nProvidence; this affair as well as another; I\'ll trust to that for\r\ngetting my desarts in all things."\r\n\r\nHaving thus betrayed what might be termed his weak spot, the young man\r\ncontinued to paddle in silence, making his way diligently, and as fast\r\nas his tows would allow him, towards the castle. By this time the sun\r\nhad not only risen, but it had appeared over the eastern mountains, and\r\nwas shedding a flood of glorious light on this as yet unchristened\r\nsheet of water. The whole scene was radiant with beauty; and no one\r\nunaccustomed to the ordinary history of the woods would fancy it had so\r\nlately witnessed incidents so ruthless and barbarous. As he approached\r\nthe building of old Hutter, Deerslayer thought, or rather felt that\r\nits appearance was in singular harmony with all the rest of the scene.\r\nAlthough nothing had been consulted but strength and security, the rude,\r\nmassive logs, covered with their rough bark, the projecting roof, and\r\nthe form, would contribute to render the building picturesque in almost\r\nany situation, while its actual position added novelty and piquancy to\r\nits other points of interest.\r\n\r\nWhen Deerslayer drew nearer to the castle, however, objects of interest\r\npresented themselves that at once eclipsed any beauties that might have\r\ndistinguished the scenery of the lake, and the site of the singular\r\nedifice. Judith and Hetty stood on the platform before the door, Hurry\'s\r\ndooryard awaiting his approach with manifest anxiety; the former, from\r\ntime to time, taking a survey of his person and of the canoes through\r\nthe old ship\'s spyglass that has been already mentioned. Never probably\r\ndid this girl seem more brilliantly beautiful than at that moment; the\r\nflush of anxiety and alarm increasing her color to its richest tints,\r\nwhile the softness of her eyes, a charm that even poor Hetty shared with\r\nher, was deepened by intense concern. Such, at least, without pausing\r\nor pretending to analyze motives, or to draw any other very nice\r\ndistinction between cause and effect, were the opinions of the young man\r\nas his canoes reached the side of the ark, where he carefully fastened\r\nall three before he put his foot on the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles;\r\n    His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate;\r\n    His tears pure messengers sent from his heart;\r\n    His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth."\r\n\r\n    Two Gentlemen of Verona, II.vii,75-78\r\n\r\nNeither of the girls spoke as Deerslayer stood before them alone, his\r\ncountenance betraying all the apprehension he felt on account of two\r\nabsent members of their party.\r\n\r\n"Father!" Judith at length exclaimed, succeeding in uttering the word,\r\nas it might be by a desperate effort.\r\n\r\n"He\'s met with misfortune, and there\'s no use in concealing it,"\r\nanswered Deerslayer, in his direct and simple minded manner. "He\r\nand Hurry are in Mingo hands, and Heaven only knows what\'s to be the\r\ntarmination. I\'ve got the canoes safe, and that\'s a consolation, since\r\nthe vagabonds will have to swim for it, or raft off, to come near this\r\nplace. At sunset we\'ll be reinforced by Chingachgook, if I can manage to\r\nget him into a canoe; and then, I think, we two can answer for the ark\r\nand the castle, till some of the officers in the garrisons hear of this\r\nwar-path, which sooner or later must be the case, when we may look for\r\nsuccor from that quarter, if from no other."\r\n\r\n"The officers!" exclaimed Judith, impatiently, her color deepening, and\r\nher eye expressing a lively but passing emotion. "Who thinks or speaks\r\nof the heartless gallants now? We are sufficient of ourselves to defend\r\nthe castle. But what of my father, and of poor Hurry Harry?"\r\n\r\n"\'T is natural you should feel this consarn for your own parent, Judith,\r\nand I suppose it\'s equally so that you should feel it for Hurry Harry,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer then commenced a succinct but clear narrative of all that\r\noccurred during the night, in no manner concealing what had befallen\r\nhis two companions, or his own opinion of what might prove to be the\r\nconsequences. The girls listened with profound attention, but neither\r\nbetrayed that feminine apprehension and concern which would have\r\nfollowed such a communication when made to those who were less\r\naccustomed to the hazards and accidents of a frontier life. To the\r\nsurprise of Deerslayer, Judith seemed the most distressed, Hetty\r\nlistening eagerly, but appearing to brood over the facts in melancholy\r\nsilence, rather than betraying any outward signs of feeling. The\r\nformer\'s agitation, the young man did not fail to attribute to the\r\ninterest she felt in Hurry, quite as much as to her filial love, while\r\nHetty\'s apparent indifference was ascribed to that mental darkness\r\nwhich, in a measure, obscured her intellect, and which possibly\r\nprevented her from foreseeing all the consequences. Little was said,\r\nhowever, by either, Judith and her sister busying themselves in making\r\nthe preparations for the morning meal, as they who habitually attend\r\nto such matters toil on mechanically even in the midst of suffering and\r\nsorrow. The plain but nutritious breakfast was taken by all three in\r\nsombre silence. The girls ate little, but Deerslayer gave proof of\r\npossessing one material requisite of a good soldier, that of preserving\r\nhis appetite in the midst of the most alarming and embarrassing\r\ncircumstances. The meal was nearly ended before a syllable was uttered;\r\nthen, however, Judith spoke in the convulsive and hurried manner in\r\nwhich feeling breaks through restraint, after the latter has become more\r\npainful than even the betrayal of emotion.\r\n\r\n"Father would have relished this fish," she exclaimed; "he says the\r\nsalmon of the lakes is almost as good as the salmon of the sea."\r\n\r\n"Your father has been acquainted with the sea, they tell me, Judith,"\r\nreturned the young man, who could not forbear throwing a glance of\r\ninquiry at the girl; for in common with all who knew Hutter, he had some\r\ncuriosity on the subject of his early history. "Hurry Harry tells me he\r\nwas once a sailor."\r\n\r\nJudith first looked perplexed; then, influenced by feelings that were\r\nnovel to her, in more ways than one, she became suddenly communicative,\r\nand seemingly much interested in the discourse.\r\n\r\n"If Hurry knows anything of father\'s history, I would he had told it to\r\nme!" she cried. "Sometimes I think, too, he was once a sailor, and then\r\nagain I think he was not. If that chest were open, or if it could speak,\r\nit might let us into his whole history. But its fastenings are too\r\nstrong to be broken like pack thread."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer turned to the chest in question, and for the first time\r\nexamined it closely. Although discolored, and bearing proofs of having\r\nreceived much ill-treatment, he saw that it was of materials and\r\nworkmanship altogether superior to anything of the same sort he had\r\never before beheld. The wood was dark, rich, and had once been highly\r\npolished, though the treatment it had received left little gloss on\r\nits surface, and various scratches and indentations proved the rough\r\ncollisions that it had encountered with substances still harder than\r\nitself. The corners were firmly bound with steel, elaborately and richly\r\nwrought, while the locks, of which it had no less than three, and the\r\nhinges, were of a fashion and workmanship that would have attracted\r\nattention even in a warehouse of curious furniture. This chest was quite\r\nlarge; and when Deerslayer arose, and endeavored to raise an end by its\r\nmassive handle, he found that the weight fully corresponded with the\r\nexternal appearance.\r\n\r\n"Did you never see that chest opened, Judith?" the young man demanded\r\nwith frontier freedom, for delicacy on such subjects was little felt\r\namong the people on the verge of civilization, in that age, even if it\r\nbe to-day.\r\n\r\n"Never. Father has never opened it in my presence, if he ever opens it\r\nat all. No one here has ever seen its lid raised, unless it be father;\r\nnor do I even know that he has ever seen it."\r\n\r\n"Now you\'re wrong, Judith," Hetty quietly answered. "Father has raised\r\nthe lid, and I\'ve seen him do it."\r\n\r\nA feeling of manliness kept the mouth of Deerslayer shut; for, while he\r\nwould not have hesitated about going far beyond what would be thought\r\nthe bounds of propriety, in questioning the older sister, he had just\r\nscruples about taking what might be thought an advantage of the feeble\r\nintellect of the younger. Judith, being under no such restraint,\r\nhowever, turned quickly to the last speaker and continued the discourse.\r\n\r\n"When and where did you ever see that chest opened, Hetty?"\r\n\r\n"Here, and again and again. Father often opens it when you are away,\r\nthough he don\'t in the least mind my being by, and seeing all he does,\r\nas well as hearing all he says."\r\n\r\n"And what is it that he does, and what does he say?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot tell you, Judith," returned the other in a low but\r\nresolute voice. "Father\'s secrets are not my secrets."\r\n\r\n"Secrets! This is stranger still, Deerslayer, that father should tell\r\nthem to Hetty, and not tell them to me!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a good reason for that, Judith, though you\'re not to know it.\r\nFather\'s not here to answer for himself, and I\'ll say no more about it."\r\n\r\nJudith and Deerslayer looked surprised, and for a minute the first\r\nseemed pained. But, suddenly recollecting herself, she turned away from\r\nher sister, as if in pity for her weakness and addressed the young man.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve told but half your story," she said, "breaking off at the place\r\nwhere you went to sleep in the canoe--or rather where you rose to listen\r\nto the cry of the loon. We heard the call of the loons, too, and thought\r\ntheir cries might bring a storm, though we are little used to tempests\r\non this lake at this season of the year."\r\n\r\n"The winds blow and the tempests howl as God pleases; sometimes at one\r\nseason, and sometimes at another," answered Deerslayer; "and the loons\r\nspeak accordin\' to their natur\'. Better would it be if men were as\r\nhonest and frank. After I rose to listen to the birds, finding it could\r\nnot be Hurry\'s signal, I lay down and slept. When the day dawned I was\r\nup and stirring, as usual, and then I went in chase of the two canoes,\r\nlest the Mingos should lay hands on \'em."\r\n\r\n"You have not told us all, Deerslayer," said Judith earnestly. "We heard\r\nrifles under the eastern mountain; the echoes were full and long, and\r\ncame so soon after the reports, that the pieces must have been fired on\r\nor quite near to the shore. Our ears are used to these signs, and are\r\nnot to be deceived."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve done their duty, gal, this time; yes, they\'ve done their duty.\r\nRifles have been sighted this morning, ay, and triggers pulled, too,\r\nthough not as often as they might have been. One warrior has gone to his\r\nhappy hunting-grounds, and that\'s the whole of it. A man of white blood\r\nand white gifts is not to be expected to boast of his expl\'ites and to\r\nflourish scalps."\r\n\r\nJudith listened almost breathlessly; and when Deerslayer, in his quiet,\r\nmodest manner, seemed disposed to quit the subject, she rose, and\r\ncrossing the room, took a seat by his side. The manner of the girl had\r\nnothing forward about it, though it betrayed the quick instinct of a\r\nfemale\'s affection, and the sympathizing kindness of a woman\'s heart.\r\nShe even took the hard hand of the hunter, and pressed it in both her\r\nown, unconsciously to herself, perhaps, while she looked earnestly and\r\neven reproachfully into his sun burnt face.\r\n\r\n"You have been fighting the savages, Deerslayer, singly and by\r\nyourself!" she said. "In your wish to take care of us---of Hetty--of me,\r\nperhaps, you\'ve fought the enemy bravely, with no eye to encourage your\r\ndeeds, or to witness your fall, had it pleased Providence to suffer so\r\ngreat a calamity!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve fou\'t, Judith; yes, I have fou\'t the inimy, and that too, for the\r\nfirst time in my life. These things must be, and they bring with \'em a\r\nmixed feelin\' of sorrow and triumph. Human natur\' is a fightin\' natur\',\r\nI suppose, as all nations kill in battle, and we must be true to our\r\nrights and gifts. What has yet been done is no great matter, but should\r\nChingachgook come to the rock this evening, as is agreed atween us, and\r\nI get him off it onbeknown to the savages or, if known to them, ag\'in\r\ntheir wishes and designs, then may we all look to something like\r\nwarfare, afore the Mingos shall get possession of either the castle, or\r\nthe ark, or yourselves."\r\n\r\n"Who is this Chingachgook; from what place does he come, and why does he\r\ncome here?"\r\n\r\n"The questions are nat\'ral and right, I suppose, though the youth has a\r\ngreat name, already, in his own part of the country. Chingachgook is a\r\nMohican by blood, consorting with the Delawares by usage, as is the case\r\nwith most of his tribe, which has long been broken up by the increase of\r\nour color. He is of the family of the great chiefs; Uncas, his father,\r\nhaving been the considerablest warrior and counsellor of his people.\r\nEven old Tamenund honors Chingachgook, though he is thought to be\r\nyet too young to lead in war; and then the nation is so disparsed and\r\ndiminished, that chieftainship among \'em has got to be little more than\r\na name.\r\n\r\n"Well, this war having commenced in \'arnest, the Delaware and I\r\nrendezvous\'d an app\'intment, to meet this evening at sunset on the\r\nrendezvous-rock at the foot of this very lake, intending to come out on\r\nour first hostile expedition ag\'in the Mingos. Why we come exactly this\r\na way is our own secret; but thoughtful young men on the war-path, as\r\nyou may suppose, do nothing without a calculation and a design."\r\n\r\n"A Delaware can have no unfriendly intentions towards us," said Judith,\r\nafter a moment\'s hesitation, "and we know you to be friendly."\r\n\r\n"Treachery is the last crime I hope to be accused of," returned\r\nDeerslayer, hurt at the gleam of distrust that had shot through Judith\'s\r\nmind; "and least of all, treachery to my own color."\r\n\r\n"No one suspects you, Deerslayer," the girl impetuously cried.\r\n"No--no--your honest countenance would be sufficient surety for the\r\ntruth of a thousand hearts! If all men had as honest tongues, and no\r\nmore promised what they did not mean to perform, there would be less\r\nwrong done in the world, and fine feathers and scarlet cloaks would not\r\nbe excuses for baseness and deception."\r\n\r\nThe girl spoke with strong, nay, even with convulsed feeling, and her\r\nfine eyes, usually so soft and alluring, flashed fire as she concluded.\r\nDeerslayer could not but observe this extraordinary emotion; but\r\nwith the tact of a courtier, he avoided not only any allusion to the\r\ncircumstance, but succeeded in concealing the effect of his discovery\r\non himself. Judith gradually grew calm again, and as she was obviously\r\nanxious to appear to advantage in the eyes of the young man, she was\r\nsoon able to renew the conversation as composedly as if nothing had\r\noccurred to disturb her.\r\n\r\n"I have no right to look into your secrets, or the secrets of your\r\nfriend, Deerslayer," she continued, "and am ready to take all you say on\r\ntrust. If we can really get another male ally to join us at this trying\r\nmoment, it will aid us much; and I am not without hope that when the\r\nsavages find that we are able to keep the lake, they will offer to give\r\nup their prisoners in exchange for skins, or at least for the keg of\r\npowder that we have in the house."\r\n\r\nThe young man had the words "scalps" and "bounty" on his lips, but a\r\nreluctance to alarm the feelings of the daughters prevented him from\r\nmaking the allusion he had intended to the probable fate of their\r\nfather. Still, so little was he practised in the arts of deception,\r\nthat his expressive countenance was, of itself, understood by the\r\nquick-witted Judith, whose intelligence had been sharpened by the risks\r\nand habits of her life.\r\n\r\n"I understand what you mean," she continued, hurriedly, "and what you\r\nwould say, but for the fear of hurting me--us, I mean; for Hetty\r\nloves her father quite as well as I do. But this is not as we think of\r\nIndians. They never scalp an unhurt prisoner, but would rather take him\r\naway alive, unless, indeed, the fierce wish for torturing should get the\r\nmastery of them. I fear nothing for my father\'s scalp, and little for\r\nhis life. Could they steal on us in the night, we should all probably\r\nsuffer in this way; but men taken in open strife are seldom injured;\r\nnot, at least, until the time of torture comes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s tradition, I\'ll allow, and it\'s accordin\' to practice--but,\r\nJudith, do you know the arr\'nd on which your father and Hurry went ag\'in\r\nthe savages?"\r\n\r\n"I do; and a cruel errand it was! But what will you have? Men will be\r\nmen, and some even that flaunt in their gold and silver, and carry the\r\nKing\'s commission in their pockets, are not guiltless of equal cruelty."\r\nJudith\'s eye again flashed, but by a desperate struggle she resumed her\r\ncomposure. "I get warm when I think of all the wrong that men do,"\r\nshe added, affecting to smile, an effort in which she only succeeded\r\nindifferently well. "All this is silly. What is done is done, and it\r\ncannot be mended by complaints. But the Indians think so little of\r\nthe shedding of blood, and value men so much for the boldness of their\r\nundertakings, that, did they know the business on which their prisoners\r\ncame, they would be more likely to honor than to injure them for it."\r\n\r\n"For a time, Judith; yes, I allow that, for a time. But when that\r\nfeelin\' dies away, then will come the love of revenge. We must\r\nindivor,--Chingachgook and I,--we must indivor to see what we can do to\r\nget Hurry and your father free; for the Mingos will no doubt hover about\r\nthis lake some days, in order to make the most of their success."\r\n\r\n"You think this Delaware can be depended on, Deerslayer?" demanded the\r\ngirl, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"As much as I can myself. You say you do not suspect me, Judith?"\r\n\r\n"You!" taking his hand again, and pressing it between her own, with a\r\nwarmth that might have awakened the vanity of one less simple-minded,\r\nand more disposed to dwell on his own good qualities, "I would as soon\r\nsuspect a brother! I have known you but a day, Deerslayer, but it has\r\nawakened the confidence of a year. Your name, however, is not unknown\r\nto me; for the gallants of the garrisons frequently speak of the lessons\r\nyou have given them in hunting, and all proclaim your honesty."\r\n\r\n"Do they ever talk of the shooting, gal?" inquired the other eagerly,\r\nafter, however, laughing in a silent but heartfelt manner. "Do they ever\r\ntalk of the shooting? I want to hear nothing about my own, for if that\r\nisn\'t sartified to by this time, in all these parts, there\'s little\r\nuse in being skilful and sure; but what do the officers say of their\r\nown--yes, what do they say of their own? Arms, as they call it, is their\r\ntrade, and yet there\'s some among \'em that know very little how to use\r\n\'em!"\r\n\r\n"Such I hope will not be the case with your friend Chingachgook, as you\r\ncall him--what is the English of his Indian name?"\r\n\r\n"Big Sarpent--so called for his wisdom and cunning, Uncas is his ra\'al\r\nname--all his family being called Uncas until they get a title that has\r\nbeen \'arned by deeds."\r\n\r\n"If he has all this wisdom, we may expect a useful friend in him, unless\r\nhis own business in this part of the country should prevent him from\r\nserving us."\r\n\r\n"I see no great harm in telling you his arr\'nd, a\'ter all, and, as\r\nyou may find means to help us, I will let you and Hetty into the whole\r\nmatter, trusting that you\'ll keep the secret as if it was your own. You\r\nmust know that Chingachgook is a comely Injin, and is much looked upon\r\nand admired by the young women of his tribe, both on account of his\r\nfamily, and on account of himself. Now, there is a chief that has a\r\ndaughter called Wah-ta-Wah, which is intarpreted into Hist-oh-Hist, in\r\nthe English tongue, the rarest gal among the Delawares, and the one\r\nmost sought a\'ter and craved for a wife by all the young warriors of the\r\nnation. Well, Chingachgook, among others, took a fancy to Wah-ta-Wah,\r\nand Wah-ta-Wah took a fancy to him." Here Deerslayer paused an instant;\r\nfor, as he got thus far in his tale, Hetty Hutter arose, approached,\r\nand stood attentive at his knee, as a child draws near to listen to\r\nthe legends of its mother. "Yes, he fancied her, and she fancied him,"\r\nresumed Deerslayer, casting a friendly and approving glance at the\r\ninnocent and interested girl; "and when that is the case, and all the\r\nelders are agreed, it does not often happen that the young couple keep\r\napart. Chingachgook couldn\'t well carry off such a prize without making\r\ninimies among them that wanted her as much as he did himself. A sartain\r\nBriarthorn, as we call him in English, or Yocommon, as he is tarmed in\r\nInjin, took it most to heart, and we mistrust him of having a hand in\r\nall that followed."\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah went with her father and mother, two moons ago, to fish for\r\nsalmon on the western streams, where it is agreed by all in these parts\r\nthat fish most abounds, and while thus empl\'yed the gal vanished. For\r\nseveral weeks we could get no tidings of her; but here, ten days since,\r\na runner, that came through the Delaware country, brought us a message,\r\nby which we learn that Wah-ta-Wah was stolen from her people, we think,\r\nbut do not know it, by Briarthorn\'s sarcumventions,--and that she was\r\nnow with the inimy, who had adopted her, and wanted her to marry a\r\nyoung Mingo. The message said that the party intended to hunt and forage\r\nthrough this region for a month or two, afore it went back into the\r\nCanadas, and that if we could contrive to get on a scent in this\r\nquarter, something might turn up that would lead to our getting the\r\nmaiden off."\r\n\r\n"And how does that concern you, Deerslayer?" demanded Judith, a little\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"It consarns me, as all things that touches a fri\'nd consarns a fri\'nd.\r\nI\'m here as Chingachgook\'s aid and helper, and if we can get the young\r\nmaiden he likes back ag\'in, it will give me almost as much pleasure as\r\nif I had got back my own sweetheart."\r\n\r\n"And where, then, is your sweetheart, Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s in the forest, Judith--hanging from the boughs of the trees, in a\r\nsoft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that float about in\r\nthe blue heavens--the birds that sing in the woods--the sweet springs\r\nwhere I slake my thirst--and in all the other glorious gifts that come\r\nfrom God\'s Providence!"\r\n\r\n"You mean that, as yet, you\'ve never loved one of my sex, but love best\r\nyour haunts, and your own manner of life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--that\'s just it. I am white--have a white heart and can\'t,\r\nin reason, love a red-skinned maiden, who must have a red-skin heart\r\nand feelin\'s. No, no, I\'m sound enough in them partic\'lars, and hope to\r\nremain so, at least till this war is over. I find my time too much taken\r\nup with Chingachgook\'s affair, to wish to have one of my own on my hands\r\nafore that is settled."\r\n\r\n\r\n"The girl that finally wins you, Deerslayer, will at least win an honest\r\nheart,--one without treachery or guile; and that will be a victory that\r\nmost of her sex ought to envy."\r\n\r\nAs Judith uttered this, her beautiful face had a resentful frown on it;\r\nwhile a bitter smile lingered around a mouth that no derangement of the\r\nmuscles could render anything but handsome. Her companion observed the\r\nchange, and though little skilled in the workings of the female heart,\r\nhe had sufficient native delicacy to understand that it might be well to\r\ndrop the subject.\r\n\r\nAs the hour when Chingachgook was expected still remained distant,\r\nDeerslayer had time enough to examine into the state of the defences,\r\nand to make such additional arrangements as were in his power, and the\r\nexigency of the moment seemed to require. The experience and foresight\r\nof Hutter had left little to be done in these particulars; still,\r\nseveral precautions suggested themselves to the young man, who may be\r\nsaid to have studied the art of frontier warfare, through the traditions\r\nand legends of the people among whom he had so long lived. The distance\r\nbetween the castle and the nearest point on the shore, prevented any\r\napprehension on the subject of rifle-bullets thrown from the land. The\r\nhouse was within musket-shot in one sense, it was true, but aim was\r\nentirely out of the question, and even Judith professed a perfect\r\ndisregard of any danger from that source. So long, then, as the party\r\nremained in possession of the fortress, they were safe, unless their\r\nassailants could find the means to come off and carry it by fire or\r\nstorm, or by some of the devices of Indian cunning and Indian treachery.\r\n\r\nAgainst the first source of danger Hutter had made ample provision, and\r\nthe building itself, the bark roof excepted, was not very combustible.\r\nThe floor was scuttled in several places, and buckets provided with\r\nropes were in daily use, in readiness for any such emergency. One of the\r\ngirls could easily extinguish any fire that might be lighted, provided\r\nit had not time to make much headway. Judith, who appeared to understand\r\nall her father\'s schemes of defence, and who had the spirit to take no\r\nunimportant share in the execution of them, explained all these details\r\nto the young man, who was thus saved much time and labor in making his\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nLittle was to be apprehended during the day. In possession of the\r\ncanoes and of the ark, no other vessel was to be found on the lake.\r\nNevertheless, Deerslayer well knew that a raft was soon made, and, as\r\ndead trees were to be found in abundance near the water, did the savages\r\nseriously contemplate the risks of an assault, it would not be a very\r\ndifficult matter to find the necessary means. The celebrated American\r\naxe, a tool that is quite unrivalled in its way, was then not very\r\nextensively known, and the savages were far from expert in the use of\r\nits hatchet-like substitute; still, they had sufficient practice in\r\ncrossing streams by this mode to render it certain they would construct\r\na raft, should they deem it expedient to expose themselves to the risks\r\nof an assault. The death of their warrior might prove a sufficient\r\nincentive, or it might act as a caution; but Deerslayer thought it more\r\nthan possible that the succeeding night would bring matters to a crisis,\r\nand in this precise way. This impression caused him to wish ardently for\r\nthe presence and succor of his Mohican friend, and to look forward to\r\nthe approach of sunset with an increasing anxiety.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced, the party in the castle matured their plans,\r\nand made their preparations. Judith was active, and seemed to find a\r\npleasure in consulting and advising with her new acquaintance,\r\nwhose indifference to danger, manly devotion to herself and sister,\r\nguilelessness of manner, and truth of feeling, had won rapidly on both\r\nher imagination and her affections. Although the hours appeared long in\r\nsome respects to Deerslayer, Judith did not find them so, and when the\r\nsun began to descend towards the pine-clad summits of the western hills,\r\nshe felt and expressed her surprise that the day should so soon be\r\ndrawing to a close. On the other hand, Hetty was moody and silent. She\r\nwas never loquacious, or if she occasionally became communicative, it\r\nwas under the influence of some temporary excitement that served to\r\narouse her unsophisticated mind; but, for hours at a time, in the course\r\nof this all-important day, she seemed to have absolutely lost the use\r\nof her tongue. Nor did apprehension on account of her father materially\r\naffect the manner of either sister. Neither appeared seriously to dread\r\nany evil greater than captivity, and once or twice, when Hetty did\r\nspeak, she intimated the expectation that Hutter would find the means\r\nto liberate himself. Although Judith was less sanguine on this head, she\r\ntoo betrayed the hope that propositions for a ransom would come,\r\nwhen the Indians discovered that the castle set their expedients and\r\nartifices at defiance. Deerslayer, however, treated these passing\r\nsuggestions as the ill-digested fancies of girls, making his own\r\narrangements as steadily, and brooding over the future as seriously, as\r\nif they had never fallen from their lips.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour arrived when it became necessary to proceed to\r\nthe place of rendezvous appointed with the Mohican, or Delaware, as\r\nChingachgook was more commonly called. As the plan had been matured\r\nby Deerslayer, and fully communicated to his companions, all three set\r\nabout its execution, in concert, and intelligently. Hetty passed into\r\nthe ark, and fastening two of the canoes together, she entered one, and\r\npaddled up to a sort of gateway in the palisadoes that surrounded the\r\nbuilding, through which she carried both; securing them beneath the\r\nhouse by chains that were fastened within the building. These palisadoes\r\nwere trunks of trees driven firmly into the mud, and served the double\r\npurpose of a small inclosure that was intended to be used in this very\r\nmanner, and to keep any enemy that might approach in boats at arm\'s\r\nlength. Canoes thus docked were, in a measure, hid from sight, and as\r\nthe gate was properly barred and fastened, it would not be an easy\r\ntask to remove them, even in the event of their being seen. Previously,\r\nhowever, to closing the gate, Judith also entered within the inclosure\r\nwith the third canoe, leaving Deerslayer busy in securing the door and\r\nwindows inside the building, over her head. As everything was massive\r\nand strong, and small saplings were used as bars, it would have been the\r\nwork of an hour or two to break into the building, when Deerslayer had\r\nended his task, even allowing the assailants the use of any tools but\r\nthe axe, and to be unresisted. This attention to security arose from\r\nHutter\'s having been robbed once or twice by the lawless whites of the\r\nfrontiers, during some of his many absences from home.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all was fast in the inside of the dwelling, Deerslayer\r\nappeared at a trap, from which he descended into the canoe of Judith.\r\nWhen this was done, he fastened the door with a massive staple and stout\r\npadlock. Hetty was then received in the canoe, which was shoved outside\r\nof the palisadoes. The next precaution was to fasten the gate, and the\r\nkeys were carried into the ark. The three were now fastened out of the\r\ndwelling, which could only be entered by violence, or by following the\r\ncourse taken by the young man in quitting it. The glass had been brought\r\noutside as a preliminary step, and Deerslayer next took a careful survey\r\nof the entire shore of the lake, as far as his own position would allow.\r\nNot a living thing was visible, a few birds excepted, and even the last\r\nfluttered about in the shades of the trees, as if unwilling to encounter\r\nthe heat of a sultry afternoon. All the nearest points, in particular,\r\nwere subjected to severe scrutiny, in order to make certain that no raft\r\nwas in preparation; the result everywhere giving the same picture of\r\ncalm solitude. A few words will explain the greatest embarrassment\r\nbelonging to the situation of our party. Exposed themselves to the\r\nobservation of any watchful eyes, the movements of their enemies were\r\nconcealed by the drapery of a dense forest. While the imagination would\r\nbe very apt to people the latter with more warriors than it really\r\ncontained, their own weakness must be too apparent to all who might\r\nchance to cast a glance in their direction.\r\n\r\n"Nothing is stirring, howsever," exclaimed Deerslayer, as he finally\r\nlowered the glass, and prepared to enter the ark. "If the vagabonds do\r\nharbor mischief in their minds, they are too cunning to let it be seen;\r\nit\'s true, a raft may be in preparation in the woods, but it has not\r\nyet been brought down to the lake. They can\'t guess that we are about to\r\nquit the castle, and, if they did, they\'ve no means of knowing where we\r\nintend to go."\r\n\r\n"This is so true, Deerslayer," returned Judith, "that now all is ready,\r\nwe may proceed at once, boldly, and without the fear of being followed;\r\nelse we shall be behind our time."\r\n\r\n"No, no; the matter needs management; for, though the savages are in the\r\ndark as to Chingachgook and the rock, they\'ve eyes and legs, and will\r\nsee in what direction we steer, and will be sartain to follow us. I\r\nshall strive to baffle \'em, howsever, by heading the scow in all manner\r\nof ways, first in one quarter and then in another, until they get to be\r\na-leg-weary, and tired of tramping a\'ter us."\r\n\r\nSo far as it was in his power, Deerslayer was as good as his word. In\r\nless than five minutes after this speech was made, the whole party was\r\nin the ark, and in motion. There was a gentle breeze from the north, and\r\nboldly hoisting the sail, the young man laid the head of the unwieldy\r\ncraft in such a direction, as, after making a liberal but necessary\r\nallowance for leeway, would have brought it ashore a couple of miles\r\ndown the lake, and on its eastern side. The sailing of the ark was\r\nnever very swift, though, floating as it did on the surface, it was not\r\ndifficult to get it in motion, or to urge it along over the water at the\r\nrate of some three or four miles in the hour. The distance between the\r\ncastle and the rock was a little more than two leagues. Knowing the\r\npunctuality of an Indian, Deerslayer had made his calculations closely,\r\nand had given himself a little more time than was necessary to reach the\r\nplace of rendezvous, with a view to delay or to press his arrival, as\r\nmight prove most expedient. When he hoisted the sail, the sun lay above\r\nthe western hills, at an elevation that promised rather more than two\r\nhours of day; and a few minutes satisfied him that the progress of the\r\nscow was such as to equal his expectations.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious June afternoon, and never did that solitary sheet of\r\nwater seem less like an arena of strife and bloodshed. The light air\r\nscarce descended as low as the bed of the lake, hovering over it, as if\r\nunwilling to disturb its deep tranquillity, or to ruffle its mirror-like\r\nsurface. Even the forests appeared to be slumbering in the sun, and a\r\nfew piles of fleecy clouds had lain for hours along the northern horizon\r\nlike fixtures in the atmosphere, placed there purely to embellish the\r\nscene. A few aquatic fowls occasionally skimmed along the water, and a\r\nsingle raven was visible, sailing high above the trees, and keeping\r\na watchful eye on the forest beneath him, in order to detect anything\r\nhaving life that the mysterious woods might offer as prey.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably have observed, that, amidst the frankness and\r\nabruptness of manner which marked the frontier habits of Judith, her\r\nlanguage was superior to that used by her male companions, her own\r\nfather included. This difference extended as well to pronunciation as\r\nto the choice of words and phrases. Perhaps nothing so soon betrays\r\nthe education and association as the modes of speech; and few\r\naccomplishments so much aid the charm of female beauty as a graceful and\r\neven utterance, while nothing so soon produces the disenchantment that\r\nnecessarily follows a discrepancy between appearance and manner, as\r\na mean intonation of voice, or a vulgar use of words. Judith and her\r\nsister were marked exceptions to all the girls of their class, along\r\nthat whole frontier; the officers of the nearest garrison having often\r\nflattered the former with the belief that few ladies of the towns\r\nacquitted themselves better than herself, in this important particular.\r\nThis was far from being literally true, but it was sufficiently near the\r\nfact to give birth to the compliment. The girls were indebted to their\r\nmother for this proficiency, having acquired from her, in childhood, an\r\nadvantage that no subsequent study or labor can give without a drawback,\r\nif neglected beyond the earlier periods of life. Who that mother was,\r\nor rather had been, no one but Hutter knew. She had now been dead two\r\nsummers, and, as was stated by Hurry, she had been buried in the lake;\r\nwhether in indulgence of a prejudice, or from a reluctance to take the\r\ntrouble to dig her grave, had frequently been a matter of discussion\r\nbetween the rude beings of that region. Judith had never visited the\r\nspot, but Hetty was present at the interment, and she often paddled a\r\ncanoe, about sunset or by the light of the moon, to the place, and gazed\r\ndown into the limpid water, in the hope of being able to catch a glimpse\r\nof the form that she had so tenderly loved from infancy to the sad hour\r\nof their parting.\r\n\r\n"Must we reach the rock exactly at the moment the sun sets?" Judith\r\ndemanded of the young man, as they stood near each other, Deerslayer\r\nholding the steering-oar, and she working with a needle at some ornament\r\nof dress, that much exceeded her station in life, and was altogether a\r\nnovelty in the woods. "Will a few minutes, sooner or later, alter the\r\nmatter? It will be very hazardous to remain long as near the shore as\r\nthat rock!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, Judith; that\'s the very difficulty! The rock\'s within p\'int\r\nblank for a shot-gun, and \'twill never do to hover about it too close\r\nand too long. When you have to deal with an Injin, you must calculate\r\nand manage, for a red natur\' dearly likes sarcumvention. Now you see,\r\nJudith, that I do not steer towards the rock at all, but here to\r\nthe eastward of it, whereby the savages will be tramping off in that\r\ndirection, and get their legs a-wearied, and all for no advantage."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, they see us, and watch our movements, Deerslayer? I\r\nwas in hopes they might have fallen back into the woods, and left us to\r\nourselves for a few hours."\r\n\r\n"That\'s altogether a woman\'s consait. There\'s no let-up in an Injin\'s\r\nwatchfulness when he\'s on a war-path, and eyes are on us at this\r\nminute, \'though the lake presarves us. We must draw near the rock on\r\na calculation, and indivor to get the miscreants on a false scent. The\r\nMingos have good noses, they tell me; but a white man\'s reason ought\r\nalways to equalize their instinct."\r\n\r\nJudith now entered into a desultory discourse with Deerslayer, in which\r\nthe girl betrayed her growing interest in the young man; an interest\r\nthat his simplicity of mind and her decision of character, sustained as\r\nit was by the consciousness awakened by the consideration her personal\r\ncharms so universally produced, rendered her less anxious to conceal\r\nthan might otherwise have been the case. She was scarcely forward in\r\nher manner, though there was sometimes a freedom in her glances that it\r\nrequired all the aid of her exceeding beauty to prevent from awakening\r\nsuspicions unfavorable to her discretion, if not to her morals. With\r\nDeerslayer, however, these glances were rendered less obnoxious to\r\nso unpleasant a construction; for she seldom looked at him without\r\ndiscovering much of the sincerity and nature that accompany the purest\r\nemotions of woman. It was a little remarkable that, as his captivity\r\nlengthened, neither of the girls manifested any great concern for\r\nher father; but, as has been said already, their habits gave them\r\nconfidence, and they looked forward to his liberation, by means of a\r\nransom, with a confidence that might, in a great degree, account for\r\ntheir apparent indifference. Once before, Hutter had been in the hands\r\nof the Iroquois, and a few skins had readily effected his release. This\r\nevent, however, unknown to the sisters, had occurred in a time of\r\npeace between England and France, and when the savages were restrained,\r\ninstead of being encouraged to commit their excesses, by the policy of\r\nthe different colonial governments.\r\n\r\nWhile Judith was loquacious and caressing in her manner, Hetty remained\r\nthoughtful and silent. Once, indeed, she drew near to Deerslayer,\r\nand questioned him a little closely as to his intentions, as well as\r\nconcerning the mode of effecting his purpose; but her wish to converse\r\nwent no further. As soon as her simple queries were answered--and\r\nanswered they all were, in the fullest and kindest manner--she withdrew\r\nto her seat, and continued to work on a coarse garment that she was\r\nmaking for her father, sometimes humming a low melancholy air, and\r\nfrequently sighing.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the time passed away; and when the sun was beginning to\r\nglow behind the fringe of the pines that bounded the western hill, or\r\nabout twenty minutes before it actually set, the ark was nearly as low\r\nas the point where Hutter and Hurry had been made prisoners. By sheering\r\nfirst to one side of the lake, and then to the other, Deerslayer managed\r\nto create an uncertainty as to his object; and, doubtless, the savages,\r\nwho were unquestionably watching his movements, were led to believe that\r\nhis aim was to communicate with them, at or near this spot, and would\r\nhasten in that direction, in order to be in readiness to profit by\r\ncircumstances. This artifice was well managed; since the sweep of the\r\nbay, the curvature of the lake, and the low marshy land that intervened,\r\nwould probably allow the ark to reach the rock before its pursuers, if\r\nreally collected near this point, could have time to make the circuit\r\nthat would be required to get there by land. With a view to aid this\r\ndeception, Deerslayer stood as near the western shore as was at all\r\nprudent; and then causing Judith and Hetty to enter the house, or cabin,\r\nand crouching himself so as to conceal his person by the frame of the\r\nscow, he suddenly threw the head of the latter round, and began to make\r\nthe best of his way towards the outlet. Favored by an increase in\r\nthe wind, the progress of the ark was such as to promise the complete\r\nsuccess of this plan, though the crab-like movement of the craft\r\ncompelled the helmsman to keep its head looking in a direction very\r\ndifferent from that in which it was actually moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Yet art thou prodigal of smiles--\r\n    Smiles, sweeter than thy frowns are stern:\r\n    Earth sends from all her thousand isles,\r\n    A shout at thy return.\r\n    The glory that comes down from thee\r\n    Bathes, in deep joy, the land and sea."\r\n\r\n    Bryant, "The Firmament," 11.19-24\r\n\r\nIt may assist the reader in understanding the events we are about to\r\nrecord, if he has a rapidly sketched picture of the scene, placed before\r\nhis eyes at a single view. It will be remembered that the lake was an\r\nirregularly shaped basin, of an outline that, in the main, was oval, but\r\nwith bays and points to relieve its formality and ornament its shores.\r\nThe surface of this beautiful sheet of water was now glittering like a\r\ngem, in the last rays of the evening sun, and the setting of the whole,\r\nhills clothed in the richest forest verdure, was lighted up with a sort\r\nof radiant smile, that is best described in the beautiful lines we have\r\nplaced at the head of this chapter. As the banks, with few exceptions,\r\nrose abruptly from the water, even where the mountain did not\r\nimmediately bound the view, there was a nearly unbroken fringe of leaves\r\noverhanging the placid lake, the trees starting out of the acclivities,\r\ninclining to the light, until, in many instances they extended their\r\nlong limbs and straight trunks some forty or fifty feet beyond the line\r\nof the perpendicular. In these cases we allude only to the giants of the\r\nforest, pines of a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet in height, for\r\nof the smaller growth, very many inclined so far as to steep their lower\r\nbranches in the water. In the position in which the Ark had now got, the\r\ncastle was concealed from view by the projection of a point, as indeed\r\nwas the northern extremity of the lake itself. A respectable mountain,\r\nforest clad, and rounded, like all the rest, limited the view in that\r\ndirection, stretching immediately across the whole of the fair\r\nscene, with the exception of a deep bay that passed the western end,\r\nlengthening the basin, for more than a mile.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the water flowed out of the lake, beneath the leafy\r\narches of the trees that lined the sides of the stream, has already been\r\nmentioned, and it has also been said that the rock, which was a favorite\r\nplace of rendezvous throughout all that region, and where Deerslayer\r\nnow expected to meet his friend, stood near this outlet, and at no great\r\ndistance from the shore. It was a large, isolated stone that rested on\r\nthe bottom of the lake, apparently left there when the waters tore away\r\nthe earth from around it, in forcing for themselves a passage down the\r\nriver, and which had obtained its shape from the action of the elements,\r\nduring the slow progress of centuries. The height of this rock could\r\nscarcely equal six feet, and, as has been said, its shape was not unlike\r\nthat which is usually given to beehives, or to a hay-cock. The latter,\r\nindeed, gives the best idea not only of its form, but of its dimensions.\r\nIt stood, and still stands, for we are writing of real scenes, within\r\nfifty feet of the bank, and in water that was only two feet in depth,\r\nthough there were seasons in which its rounded apex, if such a term can\r\nproperly be used, was covered by the lake. Many of the trees stretched\r\nso far forward, as almost to blend the rock with the shore, when seen\r\nfrom a little distance, and one tall pine in particular overhung it in a\r\nway to form a noble and appropriate canopy to a seat that had held many\r\na forest chieftain, during the long succession of unknown ages, in\r\nwhich America, and all it contained, had existed apart, in mysterious\r\nsolitude, a world by itself; equally without a familiar history, and\r\nwithout an origin that the annals of man can reach.\r\n\r\nWhen distant some two or three hundred feet from the shore, Deerslayer\r\ntook in his sail. He dropped his grapnel, as soon as he found the Ark\r\nhad drifted in a line that was directly to windward of the rock. The\r\nmotion of the scow was then checked, when it was brought head to wind,\r\nby the action of the breeze. As soon as this was done, Deerslayer "paid\r\nout line," and suffered the vessel to "set down" upon the rock, as fast\r\nas the light air could force it to leeward. Floating entirely on the\r\nsurface, this was soon effected, and the young man checked the drift\r\nwhen he was told that the stern of the scow was within fifteen or\r\neighteen feet of the desired spot.\r\n\r\nIn executing this maneuver, Deerslayer had proceeded promptly, for,\r\nwhile he did not in the least doubt that he was both watched and\r\nfollowed by the foe, he believed he distracted their movements, by the\r\napparent uncertainty of his own, and he knew they could have no means\r\nof ascertaining that the rock was his aim, unless indeed one of their\r\nprisoners had betrayed him; a chance so improbable in itself, as to give\r\nhim no concern. Notwithstanding the celerity and decision his movements,\r\nhe did not, however, venture so near the shore without taking due\r\nprecautions to effect a retreat, in the event of its becoming necessary.\r\nHe held the line in his hand, and Judith was stationed at a loop, on the\r\nside of the cabin next the shore, where she could watch the beach and\r\nthe rock, and give timely notice of the approach of either friend\r\nor foe. Hetty was also placed on watch, but it was to keep the trees\r\noverhead in view, lest some enemy might ascend one, and, by completely\r\ncommanding the interior of the scow render the defence of the hut, or\r\ncabin, useless.\r\n\r\nThe sun had disappeared from the lake and valley, when Deerslayer\r\nchecked the Ark, in the manner mentioned. Still it wanted a few\r\nminutes to the true sunset, and he knew Indian punctuality too well\r\nto anticipate any unmanly haste in his friend. The great question was,\r\nwhether, surrounded by enemies as he was known to be, he had escaped\r\ntheir toils. The occurrences of the last twenty-four hours must be a\r\nsecret to him, and like himself, Chingachgook was yet young on a path.\r\nIt was true, he came prepared to encounter the party that withheld\r\nhis promised bride, but he had no means ascertaining the extent of the\r\ndanger he ran, or the precise positions occupied by either friends, or\r\nfoes. In a word, the trained sagacity, and untiring caution of an Indian\r\nwere all he had to rely on, amid the critical risks he unavoidably ran.\r\n\r\n"Is the rock empty, Judith?" inquired Deerslayer, as soon as he\r\nhad checked the drift of the Ark, deeming it imprudent to venture\r\nunnecessarily near the shore. "Is any thing to be seen of the Delaware\r\nchief?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Deerslayer. Neither rock, shore, trees, nor lake seems to have\r\never held a human form."\r\n\r\n\'Keep close, Judith--keep close, Hetty--a rifle has a prying eye, a\r\nnimble foot, and a desperate fatal tongue. Keep close then, but keep up\r\nactyve looks, and be on the alart. \'Twould grieve me to the heart, did\r\nany harm befall either of you.\'\r\n\r\n"And you Deerslayer--" exclaimed Judith, turning her handsome face from\r\nthe loop, to bestow a gracious and grateful look on the young man--"do\r\nyou \'keep close\', and have a proper care that the savages do not catch\r\na glimpse of you! A bullet might be as fatal to you as to one of us; and\r\nthe blow that you felt, would be felt by us all."\r\n\r\n"No fear of me, Judith--no fear of me, my good gal. Do not look\r\nthis-a-way, although you look so pleasant and comely, but keep your eyes\r\non the rock, and the shore, and the--"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer was interrupted by a slight exclamation from the girl, who,\r\nin obedience to his hurried gestures, as much as in obedience to his\r\nwords, had immediately bent her looks again, in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n"What is\'t?--What is\'t, Judith?" he hastily demanded--"Is any thing to\r\nbe seen?"\r\n\r\n"There is a man on the rock!--An Indian warrior, in his paint--and\r\narmed!"\r\n\r\n"Where does he wear his hawk\'s feather?" eagerly added Deerslayer,\r\nrelaxing his hold of the line, in readiness to drift nearer to the place\r\nof rendezvous. "Is it fast to the war-lock, or does he carry it above\r\nthe left ear?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis as you say, above the left ear; he smiles, too, and mutters the\r\nword \'Mohican.\'"\r\n\r\n"God be praised, \'tis the Sarpent, at last!" exclaimed the young man,\r\nsuffering the line to slip through his hands, until hearing a light\r\nbound, in the other end of the craft, he instantly checked the rope,\r\nand began to haul it in, again, under the assurance that his object was\r\neffected. At that moment the door of the cabin was opened hastily, and,\r\na warrior, darting through the little room, stood at Deerslayer\'s side,\r\nsimply uttering the exclamation "Hugh!" At the next instant, Judith and\r\nHetty shrieked, and the air was filled with the yell of twenty savages,\r\nwho came leaping through the branches, down the bank, some actually\r\nfalling headlong into the water, in their haste.\r\n\r\n"Pull, Deerslayer," cried Judith, hastily barring the door, in order\r\nto prevent an inroad by the passage through which the Delaware had just\r\nentered; "pull, for life and death--the lake is full of savages, wading\r\nafter us!"\r\n\r\nThe young men--for Chingachgook immediately came to his friend\'s\r\nassistance--needed no second bidding, but they applied themselves to\r\ntheir task in a way that showed how urgent they deemed the occasion. The\r\ngreat difficulty was in suddenly overcoming the inertia of so large\r\na mass, for once in motion, it was easy to cause the scow to skim the\r\nwater with all the necessary speed.\r\n\r\n"Pull, Deerslayer, for Heaven\'s sake!" cried Judith, again at the loop.\r\n"These wretches rush into the water like hounds following their prey!\r\nAh--the scow moves! and now, the water deepens, to the arm-pits of the\r\nforemost, but they reach forward, and will seize the Ark!"\r\n\r\nA slight scream, and then a joyous laugh followed from the girl; the\r\nfirst produced by a desperate effort of their pursuers, and the last by\r\nits failure; the scow, which had now got fairly in motion gliding ahead\r\ninto deep water, with a velocity that set the designs of their enemies\r\nat nought. As the two men were prevented by the position of the cabin\r\nfrom seeing what passed astern, they were compelled to inquire of the\r\ngirls into the state of the chase.\r\n\r\n"What now, Judith?--What next?--Do the Mingos still follow, or are we\r\nquit of \'em, for the present," demanded Deerslayer, when he felt the\r\nrope yielding as if the scow was going fast ahead, and heard the scream\r\nand the laugh of the girl, almost in the same breath.\r\n\r\n"They have vanished!--One--the last--is just burying himself in the\r\nbushes of the bank--There, he has disappeared in the shadows of the\r\ntrees! You have got your friend, and we are all safe!"\r\n\r\nThe two men now made another great effort, pulled the Ark up swiftly to\r\nthe grapnel, tripped it, and when the scow had shot some distance and\r\nlost its way, they let the anchor drop again. Then, for the first time\r\nsince their meeting, they ceased their efforts. As the floating house\r\nnow lay several hundred feet from the shore, and offered a complete\r\nprotection against bullets, there was no longer any danger or any motive\r\nfor immediate exertion.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the two friends now recognized each other, was\r\nhighly characteristic. Chingachgook, a noble, tall, handsome and\r\nathletic young Indian warrior, first examined his rifle with care,\r\nopening the pan to make sure that the priming was not wet, and, assured\r\nof this important fact, he next cast furtive but observant glances\r\naround him, at the strange habitation and at the two girls. Still he\r\nspoke not, and most of all did he avoid the betrayal of a womanish\r\ncuriosity, by asking questions.\r\n\r\n"Judith and Hetty" said Deerslayer, with an untaught, natural\r\ncourtesy--"this is the Mohican chief of whom you\'ve heard me speak;\r\nChingachgook as he is called; which signifies Big Sarpent; so named for\r\nhis wisdom and prudence, and cunning, and my \'arliest and latest fri\'nd.\r\nI know\'d it must be he, by the hawk\'s feather over the left ear, most\r\nother warriors wearing \'em on the war-lock."\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer ceased speaking, he laughed heartily, excited more\r\nperhaps by the delight of having got his friend safe at his side, under\r\ncircumstances so trying, than by any conceit that happened to cross his\r\nfancy, and exhibiting this outbreaking of feeling in a manner that was a\r\nlittle remarkable, since his merriment was not accompanied by any\r\nnoise. Although Chingachgook both understood and spoke English, he was\r\nunwilling to communicate his thoughts in it, like most Indians, and\r\nwhen he had met Judith\'s cordial shake of the hand, and Hetty\'s milder\r\nsalute, in the courteous manner that became a chief, he turned away,\r\napparently to await the moment when it might suit his friend to enter\r\ninto an explanation of his future intentions, and to give a narrative\r\nof what had passed since their separation. The other understood his\r\nmeaning, and discovered his own mode of reasoning in the matter, by\r\naddressing the girls.\r\n\r\n"This wind will soon die away altogether, now the sun is down," he said,\r\n"and there is no need for rowing ag\'in it. In half an hour, or so, it\r\nwill either be a flat calm, or the air will come off from the south\r\nshore, when we will begin our journey back ag\'in to the castle; in the\r\nmeanwhile, the Delaware and I will talk over matters, and get correct\r\nidees of each other\'s notions consarning the course we ought to take."\r\n\r\nNo one opposed this proposition, and the girls withdrew into the cabin\r\nto prepare the evening meal, while the two young men took their seats\r\non the head of the scow and began to converse. The dialogue was in\r\nthe language of the Delawares. As that dialect, however, is but little\r\nunderstood, even by the learned; we shall not only on this, but on all\r\nsubsequent occasions render such parts as it may be necessary to give\r\nclosely, into liberal English; preserving, as far as possible, the idiom\r\nand peculiarities of the respective speakers, by way of presenting the\r\npictures in the most graphic forms to the minds of the readers.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter into the details first related by Deerslayer,\r\nwho gave a brief narrative of the facts that are already familiar to\r\nthose who have read our pages. In relating these events, however, it\r\nmay be well to say that the speaker touched only on the outlines, more\r\nparticularly abstaining from saying anything about his encounter with,\r\nand victory over the Iroquois, as well as to his own exertions in behalf\r\nof the two deserted young women. When Deerslayer ended, the Delaware\r\ntook up the narrative, in turn, speaking sententiously and with grave\r\ndignity. His account was both clear and short, nor was it embellished by\r\nany incidents that did not directly concern the history of his departure\r\nfrom the villages of his people, and his arrival in the valley of the\r\nSusquehannah. On reaching the latter, which was at a point only half\r\na mile south of the outlet, he had soon struck a trail, which gave him\r\nnotice of the probable vicinity of enemies. Being prepared for such an\r\noccurrence, the object of the expedition calling him directly into\r\nthe neighborhood of the party of Iroquois that was known to be out, he\r\nconsidered the discovery as fortunate, rather than the reverse, and took\r\nthe usual precautions to turn it to account. First following the river\r\nto its source, and ascertaining the position of the rock, he met another\r\ntrail, and had actually been hovering for hours on the flanks of his\r\nenemies, watching equally for an opportunity to meet his mistress,\r\nand to take a scalp; and it may be questioned which he most ardently\r\ndesired. He kept near the lake, and occasionally he ventured to some\r\nspot where he could get a view of what was passing on its surface. The\r\nArk had been seen and watched, from the moment it hove in sight,\r\nthough the young chief was necessarily ignorant that it was to be the\r\ninstrument of his effecting the desired junction with his friend. The\r\nuncertainty of its movements, and the fact that it was unquestionably\r\nmanaged by white men, soon led him to conjecture the truth, however,\r\nand he held himself in readiness to get on board whenever a suitable\r\noccasion might offer. As the sun drew near the horizon he repaired\r\nto the rock, where, on emerging from the forest, he was gratified in\r\nfinding the Ark lying, apparently in readiness to receive him. The\r\nmanner of his appearance, and of his entrance into the craft is known.\r\n\r\nAlthough Chingachgook had been closely watching his enemies for hours,\r\ntheir sudden and close pursuit as he reached the scow was as much a\r\nmatter of surprise to himself, as it had been to his friend. He could\r\nonly account for it by the fact of their being more numerous than he had\r\nat first supposed, and by their having out parties of the existence of\r\nwhich he was ignorant. Their regular, and permanent encampment, if the\r\nword permanent can be applied to the residence of a party that intended\r\nto remain out, in all probability, but a few weeks, was not far from\r\nthe spot where Hutter and Hurry had fallen into their hands, and, as a\r\nmatter of course, near a spring.\r\n\r\n"Well, Sarpent," asked Deerslayer, when the other had ended his brief\r\nbut spirited narrative, speaking always in the Delaware tongue, which\r\nfor the reader\'s convenience only we render into the peculiar vernacular\r\nof the speaker--"Well, Sarpent, as you\'ve been scouting around these\r\nMingos, have you anything to tell us of their captyves, the father of\r\nthese young women, and of another, who, I somewhat conclude, is the\r\nlovyer of one of \'em."\r\n\r\n"Chingachgook has seen them. An old man, and a young warrior--the\r\nfalling hemlock and the tall pine."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not so much out, Delaware; you\'re not so much out. Old Hutter is\r\ndecaying, of a sartainty, though many solid blocks might be hewn out of\r\nhis trunk yet, and, as for Hurry Harry, so far as height and strength\r\nand comeliness go, he may be called the pride of the human forest. Were\r\nthe men bound, or in any manner suffering torture? I ask on account of\r\nthe young women, who, I dare to say, would be glad to know."\r\n\r\n"It is not so, Deerslayer. The Mingos are too many to cage their game.\r\nSome watch; some sleep; some scout; some hunt. The pale-faces are\r\ntreated like brothers to-day; to-morrow they will lose their scalps."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s red natur\', and must be submitted to! Judith and Hetty,\r\nhere\'s comforting tidings for you, the Delaware telling me that neither\r\nyour father nor Hurry Harry is in suffering, but, bating the loss of\r\nliberty, as well off as we are ourselves. Of course they are kept in the\r\ncamp; otherwise they do much as they please."\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear this, Deerslayer," returned Judith, "and now we are\r\njoined by your friend, I make no manner of question that we shall find\r\nan opportunity to ransom the prisoners. If there are any women in the\r\ncamp, I have articles of dress that will catch their eyes, and, should\r\nthe worst come to the worst, we can open the great chest, which I think\r\nwill be found to hold things that may tempt the chiefs."\r\n\r\n"Judith," said the young man, looking up at her with a smile and an\r\nexpression of earnest curiosity, that in spite of the growing obscurity\r\ndid not escape the watchful looks of the girl, "can you find it in your\r\nheart, to part with your own finery, to release prisoners; even though\r\none be your own father, and the other is your sworn suitor and lovyer?"\r\n\r\nThe flush on the face of the girl arose in part from resentment,\r\nbut more perhaps from a gentler and a novel feeling, that, with the\r\ncapricious waywardness of taste, had been rapidly rendering her more\r\nsensitive to the good opinion of the youth who questioned her, than\r\nto that of any other person. Suppressing the angry sensation, with\r\ninstinctive quickness, she answered with a readiness and truth, that\r\ncaused her sister to draw near to listen, though the obtuse intellect\r\nof the latter was far from comprehending the workings of a heart as\r\ntreacherous, as uncertain, and as impetuous in its feelings, as that of\r\nthe spoiled and flattered beauty.\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer," answered Judith, after a moment\'s pause, "I shall be\r\nhonest with you. I confess that the time has been when what you call\r\nfinery, was to me the dearest thing on earth; but I begin to feel\r\ndifferently. Though Hurry Harry is nought to me nor ever can be, I\r\nwould give all I own to set him free. If I would do this for blustering,\r\nbullying, talking Hurry, who has nothing but good looks to recommend\r\nhim, you may judge what I would do for my own father."\r\n\r\n"This sounds well, and is according to woman\'s gifts. Ah\'s, me! The same\r\nfeelin\'s is to be found among the young women of the Delawares. I\'ve\r\nknown \'em, often and often, sacrifice their vanity to their hearts. \'Tis\r\nas it should be--\'tis as it should be I suppose, in both colours. Woman\r\nwas created for the feelin\'s, and is pretty much ruled by feelin\'."\r\n\r\n"Would the savages let father go, if Judith and I give them all our best\r\nthings?" demanded Hetty, in her innocent, mild, manner.\r\n\r\n"Their women might interfere, good Hetty; yes, their women might\r\ninterfere with such an ind in view. But, tell me, Sarpent, how is it\r\nas to squaws among the knaves; have they many of their own women in the\r\ncamp?"\r\n\r\nThe Delaware heard and understood all that passed, though with Indian\r\ngravity and finesse he had sat with averted face, seemingly inattentive\r\nto a discourse in which he had no direct concern. Thus appealed to,\r\nhowever, he answered his friend in his ordinary sententious manner.\r\n\r\n"Six--" he said, holding up all the fingers of one hand, and the thumb\r\nof the other, "besides this." The last number denoted his betrothed,\r\nwhom, with the poetry and truth of nature, he described by laying his\r\nhand on his own heart.\r\n\r\n"Did you see her, chief--did you get a glimpse of her pleasant\r\ncountenance, or come close enough to her ear, to sing in it the song she\r\nloves to hear?"\r\n\r\n"No, Deerslayer--the trees were too many, and leaves covered their\r\nboughs like clouds hiding the heavens in a storm. But"--and the young\r\nwarrior turned his dark face towards his friend, with a smile on it that\r\nilluminated its fierce-looking paint and naturally stern lineaments\r\nwith a bright gleam of human feeling, "Chingachgook heard the laugh of\r\nWah-ta-Wah, and knew it from the laugh of the women of the Iroquois. It\r\nsounded in his ears, like the chirp of the wren."\r\n\r\n"Ay, trust a lovyer\'s ear for that, and a Delaware\'s ear for all sounds\r\nthat are ever heard in the woods. I know not why it is so, Judith, but\r\nwhen young men--and I dares to say it may be all the same with young\r\nwomen, too--but when they get to have kind feelin\'s towards each other,\r\nit\'s wonderful how pleasant the laugh, or the speech becomes, to the\r\nother person. I\'ve seen grim warriors listening to the chattering and\r\nthe laughing of young gals, as if it was church music, such as is heard\r\nin the old Dutch church that stands in the great street of Albany, where\r\nI\'ve been, more than once, with peltry and game."\r\n\r\n"And you, Deerslayer," said Judith quickly, and with more sensibility\r\nthan marked her usually light and thoughtless manner,--"have you never\r\nfelt how pleasant it is to listen to the laugh of the girl you love?"\r\n\r\n"Lord bless you gal!--Why I\'ve never lived enough among my own colour\r\nto drop into them sort of feelin\'s,--no never! I dares to say, they are\r\nnat\'ral and right, but to me there\'s no music so sweet as the sighing\r\nof the wind in the tree tops, and the rippling of a stream from a full,\r\nsparkling, natyve fountain of pure forest water--unless, indeed,"\r\nhe continued, dropping his head for an instant in a thoughtful\r\nmanner--"unless indeed it be the open mouth of a sartain hound, when\r\nI\'m on the track of a fat buck. As for unsartain dogs, I care little for\r\ntheir cries, seein\' they are as likely to speak when the deer is not in\r\nsight, as when it is."\r\n\r\nJudith walked slowly and pensively away, nor was there any of her\r\nordinary calculating coquetry in the light tremulous sigh that,\r\nunconsciously to herself, arose to her lips. On the other hand Hetty\r\nlistened with guileless attention, though it struck her simple mind as\r\nsingular that the young man should prefer the melody of the woods,\r\nto the songs of girls, or even to the laugh of innocence and joy.\r\nAccustomed, however, to defer in most things to her sister, she soon\r\nfollowed Judith into the cabin, where she took a seat and remained\r\npondering intensely over some occurrence, or resolution, or\r\nopinion--which was a secret to all but herself. Left alone, Deerslayer\r\nand his friend resumed their discourse.\r\n\r\n"Has the young pale-face hunter been long on this lake?" demanded the\r\nDelaware, after courteously waiting for the other to speak first.\r\n\r\n"Only since yesterday noon, Sarpent, though that has been long enough to\r\nsee and do much." The gaze that the Indian fastened on his companion was\r\nso keen that it seemed to mock the gathering darkness of the night.\r\nAs the other furtively returned his look, he saw the two black eyes\r\nglistening on him, like the balls of the panther, or those of the penned\r\nwolf. He understood the meaning of this glowing gaze, and answered\r\nevasively, as he fancied would best become the modesty of a white man\'s\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis as you suspect, Sarpent; yes, \'tis somewhat that-a-way. I have\r\nfell in with the inimy, and I suppose it may be said I\'ve fou\'t them,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of delight and exultation escaped the Indian, and then\r\nlaying his hand eagerly on the arm of his friend, he asked if there were\r\nany scalps taken.\r\n\r\n"That I will maintain in the face of all the Delaware tribe, old\r\nTamenund, and your own father the great Uncas, as well as the rest, is\r\nag\'in white gifts! My scalp is on my head, as you can see, Sarpent, and\r\nthat was the only scalp that was in danger, when one side was altogether\r\nChristian and white."\r\n\r\n"Did no warrior fall?--Deerslayer did not get his name by being slow of\r\nsight, or clumsy with the rifle!"\r\n\r\n"In that particular, chief, you\'re nearer reason, and therefore nearer\r\nbeing right. I may say one Mingo fell."\r\n\r\n"A chief!" demanded the other with startling vehemence.\r\n\r\n"Nay, that\'s more than I know, or can say. He was artful, and\r\ntreacherous, and stout-hearted, and may well have gained popularity\r\nenough with his people to be named to that rank. The man fou\'t well,\r\nthough his eye was\'n\'t quick enough for one who had had his schooling in\r\nyour company, Delaware."\r\n\r\n"My brother and friend struck the body?"\r\n\r\n"That was uncalled for, seeing that the Mingo died in my arms. The truth\r\nmay as well be said, at once; he fou\'t like a man of red gifts, and I\r\nfou\'t like a man with gifts of my own colour. God gave me the victory;\r\nI coul\'n\'t fly in the face of his Providence by forgetting my birth and\r\nnatur\'. White he made me, and white I shall live and die."\r\n\r\n"Good! Deerslayer is a pale-face, and has pale-face hands. A Delaware\r\nwill look for the scalp, and hang it on a pole, and sing a song in his\r\nhonour, when we go back to our people. The glory belongs to the tribe;\r\nit must not be lost."\r\n\r\n"This is easy talking, but \'twill not be as easy doing. The Mingo\'s body\r\nis in the hands of his fri\'nds and, no doubt, is hid in some hole where\r\nDelaware cunning will never be able to get at the scalp."\r\n\r\nThe young man then gave his friend a succinct, but clear account, of the\r\nevent of the morning, concealing nothing of any moment, and yet touching\r\non every thing modestly and with a careful attention to avoid the Indian\r\nhabit of boasting. Chingachgook again expressed his satisfaction at the\r\nhonour won by his friend, and then both arose, the hour having arrived\r\nwhen it became prudent to move the Ark further from the land.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite dark, the heavens having become clouded, and the stars\r\nhid. The north wind had ceased--as was usual with the setting of the\r\nsun, and a light air arose from the south. This change favoring the\r\ndesign of Deerslayer, he lifted his grapnel, and the scow immediately\r\nand quite perceptibly began to drift more into the lake. The sail was\r\nset, when the motion of the craft increased to a rate not much less than\r\ntwo miles in the hour. As this superseded the necessity of rowing, an\r\noccupation that an Indian would not be likely to desire, Deerslayer,\r\nChingachgook and Judith seated themselves in the stern of the scow,\r\nwhere they first governed its movements by holding the oar. Here they\r\ndiscoursed on their future movements, and on the means that ought to be\r\nused in order to effect the liberation of their friends.\r\n\r\nIn this dialogue Judith held a material part, the Delaware readily\r\nunderstanding all she said, while his own replies and remarks, both of\r\nwhich were few and pithy, were occasionally rendered into English by his\r\nfriend. Judith rose greatly in the estimation of her companions, in the\r\nhalf hour that followed. Prompt of resolution and firm of purpose, her\r\nsuggestions and expedients partook of her spirit and sagacity, both of\r\nwhich were of a character to find favor with men of the frontier. The\r\nevents that had occurred since their meeting, as well as her isolated\r\nand dependant situation, induced the girl to feel towards Deerslayer\r\nlike the friend of a year instead of an acquaintance of a day, and so\r\ncompletely had she been won by his guileless truth of character and of\r\nfeeling, pure novelties in our sex, as respected her own experience,\r\nthat his peculiarities excited her curiosity, and created a confidence\r\nthat had never been awakened by any other man. Hitherto she had been\r\ncompelled to stand on the defensive in her intercourse with men, with\r\nwhat success was best known to herself, but here had she been suddenly\r\nthrown into the society and under the protection of a youth, who\r\nevidently as little contemplated evil towards herself as if he had been\r\nher brother. The freshness of his integrity, the poetry and truth of his\r\nfeelings, and even the quaintness of his forms of speech, all had their\r\ninfluence, and aided in awakening an interest that she found as pure\r\nas it was sudden and deep. Hurry\'s fine face and manly form had never\r\ncompensated for his boisterous and vulgar tone, and her intercourse with\r\nthe officers had prepared her to make comparisons under which even his\r\ngreat natural advantages suffered. But this very intercourse with the\r\nofficers who occasionally came upon the lake to fish and hunt, had an\r\neffect in producing her present sentiments towards the young stranger.\r\nWith them, while her vanity had been gratified, and her self-love\r\nstrongly awakened, she had many causes deeply to regret the\r\nacquaintance--if not to mourn over it, in secret sorrow--for it was\r\nimpossible for one of her quick intellect not to perceive how hollow was\r\nthe association between superior and inferior, and that she was regarded\r\nas the play thing of an idle hour, rather than as an equal and a friend,\r\nby even the best intentioned and least designing of her scarlet-clad\r\nadmirers. Deerslayer, on the other hand, had a window in his breast\r\nthrough which the light of his honesty was ever shining; and even his\r\nindifference to charms that so rarely failed to produce a sensation,\r\npiqued the pride of the girl, and gave him an interest that another,\r\nseemingly more favored by nature, might have failed to excite.\r\n\r\nIn this manner half an hour passed, during which time the Ark had been\r\nslowly stealing over the water, the darkness thickening around it;\r\nthough it was easy to see that the gloom of the forest at the southern\r\nend of the lake was getting to be distant, while the mountains that\r\nlined the sides of the beautiful basin were overshadowing it, nearly\r\nfrom side to side. There was, indeed, a narrow stripe of water, in the\r\ncentre of the lake where the dim light that was still shed from the\r\nheavens, fell upon its surface in a line extending north and south;\r\nand along this faint track, a sort of inverted milky way, in which the\r\nobscurity was not quite as dense as in other places, the scow held her\r\ncourse, he who steered well knowing that it led in the direction he\r\nwished to go. The reader is not to suppose, however, that any difficulty\r\ncould exist as to the course. This would have been determined by that of\r\nthe air, had it not been possible to distinguish the mountains, as well\r\nas by the dim opening to the south, which marked the position of the\r\nvalley in that quarter, above the plain of tall trees, by a sort of\r\nlessened obscurity; the difference between the darkness of the forest,\r\nand that of the night, as seen only in the air. The peculiarities\r\nat length caught the attention of Judith and the Deerslayer, and the\r\nconversation ceased, to allow each to gaze at the solemn stillness and\r\ndeep repose of nature.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a gloomy night--" observed the girl, after a pause of several\r\nminutes--"I hope we may be able to find the castle."\r\n\r\n"Little fear of our missing that, if we keep this path in the middle of\r\nthe lake," returned the young man. "Natur\' has made us a road here, and,\r\ndim as it is, there\'ll be little difficulty following it."\r\n\r\n"Do you hear nothing, Deerslayer?--It seemed as if the water was\r\nstirring quite near us!"\r\n\r\n"Sartainly something did move the water, oncommon like; must have been\r\na fish. Them creatur\'s prey upon each other like men and animals on the\r\nland; one has leaped into the air and fallen hard, back into his own\r\nelement. \'Tis of little use Judith, for any to strive to get out of\r\ntheir elements, since it\'s natur\' to stay in \'em, and natur\' will have\r\nits way. Ha! That sounds like a paddle, used with more than common\r\ncaution!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Delaware bent forward and pointed significantly into\r\nthe boundary of gloom, as if some object had suddenly caught his eye.\r\nBoth Deerslayer and Judith followed the direction of his gesture, and\r\neach got a view of a canoe at the same instant. The glimpse of this\r\nstartling neighbor was dim, and to eyes less practised it might have\r\nbeen uncertain, though to those in the Ark the object was evidently\r\na canoe with a single individual in it; the latter standing erect and\r\npaddling. How many lay concealed in its bottom, of course could not be\r\nknown. Flight, by means of oars, from a bark canoe impelled by vigorous\r\nand skilful hands, was utterly impracticable, and each of the men seized\r\nhis rifle in expectation of a conflict.\r\n\r\n"I can easily bring down the paddler," whispered Deerslayer, "but\r\nwe\'ll first hail him, and ask his arrn\'d." Then raising his voice, he\r\ncontinued in a solemn manner--"hold! If ye come nearer, I must fire,\r\nthough contrary to my wishes, and then sartain death will follow. Stop\r\npaddling, and answer."\r\n\r\n"Fire, and slay a poor defenseless girl," returned a soft tremulous\r\nfemale voice. "And God will never forgive you! Go your way, Deerslayer,\r\nand let me go mine."\r\n\r\n"Hetty!" exclaimed the young man and Judith in a breath; and the former\r\nsprang instantly to the spot where he had left the canoe they had been\r\ntowing. It was gone, and he understood the whole affair. As for the\r\nfugitive, frightened at the menace she ceased paddling, and remained\r\ndimly visible, resembling a spectral outline of a human form, standing\r\non the water. At the next moment the sail was lowered, to prevent the\r\nArk from passing the spot where the canoe lay. This last expedient,\r\nhowever, was not taken in time, for the momentum of so heavy a craft,\r\nand the impulsion of the air, soon set her by, bringing Hetty directly\r\nto windward, though still visible, as the change in the positions of\r\nthe two boats now placed her in that species of milky way which has been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n"What can this mean, Judith?" demanded Deerslayer--"Why has your sister\r\ntaken the canoe, and left us?"\r\n\r\n"You know she is feeble-minded, poor girl!--and she has her own ideas of\r\nwhat ought to be done. She loves her father more than most children love\r\ntheir parents--and--then--"\r\n\r\n"Then, what, gal? This is a trying moment; one in which truth must be\r\nspoken!"\r\n\r\nJudith felt a generous and womanly regret at betraying her sister, and\r\nshe hesitated ere she spoke again. But once more urged by Deerslayer,\r\nand conscious herself of all the risks the whole party was running by\r\nthe indiscretion of Hetty, she could refrain no longer.\r\n\r\n"Then, I fear, poor, weak-minded Hetty has not been altogether able\r\nto see all the vanity, and rudeness and folly, that lie hid behind the\r\nhandsome face and fine form of Hurry Harry. She talks of him in her\r\nsleep, and sometimes betrays the inclination in her waking moments."\r\n\r\n"You think, Judith, that your sister is now bent on some mad scheme to\r\nserve her father and Hurry, which will, in all likelihood, give them\r\nriptyles the Mingos, the mastership of a canoe?"\r\n\r\n"Such, I fear, will turn out to be the fact, Deerslayer. Poor Hetty has\r\nhardly sufficient cunning to outwit a savage."\r\n\r\nAll this while the canoe, with the form of Hetty erect in one end of it,\r\nwas dimly perceptible, though the greater drift of the Ark rendered it,\r\nat each instant, less and less distinct. It was evident no time was to\r\nbe lost, lest it should altogether disappear. The rifles were now laid\r\naside as useless, the two men seizing the oars and sweeping the head of\r\nthe scow round in the direction of the canoe. Judith, accustomed to the\r\noffice, flew to the other end of the Ark, and placed herself at what\r\nmight be called the helm. Hetty took the alarm at these preparations,\r\nwhich could not be made without noise, and started off like a bird that\r\nhad been suddenly put up by the approach of unexpected danger.\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer and his companion rowed with the energy of those who\r\nfelt the necessity of straining every nerve, and Hetty\'s strength was\r\nimpaired by a nervous desire to escape, the chase would have quickly\r\nterminated in the capture of the fugitive, had not the girl made several\r\nshort and unlooked-for deviations in her course. These turnings gave her\r\ntime, and they had also the effect of gradually bringing both canoe and\r\nArk within the deeper gloom, cast by the shadows from the hills. They\r\nalso gradually increased the distance between the fugitive and her\r\npursuers, until Judith called out to her companions to cease rowing, for\r\nshe had completely lost sight of the canoe.\r\n\r\nWhen this mortifying announcement was made, Hetty was actually so near\r\nas to understand every syllable her sister uttered, though the latter\r\nhad used the precaution of speaking as low as circumstances would allow\r\nher to do, and to make herself heard. Hetty stopped paddling at the same\r\nmoment, and waited the result with an impatience that was breathless,\r\nequally from her late exertions, and her desire to land. A dead silence\r\nimmediately fell on the lake, during which the three in the Ark were\r\nusing their senses differently, in order to detect the position of the\r\ncanoe. Judith bent forward to listen, in the hope of catching some sound\r\nthat might betray the direction in which her sister was stealing away,\r\nwhile her two companions brought their eyes as near as possible to\r\na level with the water, in order to detect any object that might be\r\nfloating on its surface. All was vain, however, for neither sound nor\r\nsight rewarded their efforts. All this time Hetty, who had not the\r\ncunning to sink into the canoe, stood erect, a finger pressed on her\r\nlips, gazing in the direction in which the voices had last been heard,\r\nresembling a statue of profound and timid attention. Her ingenuity had\r\nbarely sufficed to enable her to seize the canoe and to quit the Ark,\r\nin the noiseless manner related, and then it appeared to be momentarily\r\nexhausted. Even the doublings of the canoe had been as much the\r\nconsequence of an uncertain hand and of nervous agitation, as of any\r\ncraftiness or calculation.\r\n\r\nThe pause continued several minutes, during which Deerslayer and the\r\nDelaware conferred together in the language of the latter. Then the oars\r\ndipped, again, and the Ark moved away, rowing with as little noise as\r\npossible. It steered westward, a little southerly, or in the direction\r\nof the encampment of the enemy. Having reached a point at no great\r\ndistance from the shore, and where the obscurity was intense on account\r\nof the proximity of the land, it lay there near an hour, in waiting for\r\nthe expected approach of Hetty, who, it was thought, would make the best\r\nof her way to that spot as soon as she believed herself released\r\nfrom the danger of pursuit. No success rewarded this little blockade,\r\nhowever, neither appearance nor sound denoting the passage of the canoe.\r\nDisappointed at this failure, and conscious of the importance of getting\r\npossession of the fortress before it could be seized by the enemy,\r\nDeerslayer now took his way towards the castle, with the apprehension\r\nthat all his foresight in securing the canoes would be defeated by this\r\nunguarded and alarming movement on the part of the feeble-minded Hetty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "But who in this wild wood\r\n    May credit give to either eye, or ear?\r\n    From rocky precipice or hollow cave,\r\n    \'Midst the confused sound of rustling leaves,\r\n    And creaking boughs, and cries of nightly birds,\r\n    Returning seeming answer!"\r\n\r\n    Joanna Baihie, "Rayner: A Tragedy," II.L3-4, 6-g.\r\n\r\nFear, as much as calculation, had induced Hetty to cease paddling, when\r\nshe found that her pursuers did not know in which direction to proceed.\r\nShe remained stationary until the Ark had pulled in near the encampment,\r\nas has been related in the preceding chapter, when she resumed the\r\npaddle and with cautious strokes made the best of her way towards the\r\nwestern shore. In order to avoid her pursuers, however, who, she rightly\r\nsuspected, would soon be rowing along that shore themselves, the head\r\nof the canoe was pointed so far north as to bring her to land on a point\r\nthat thrust itself into the lake, at the distance of near a league from\r\nthe outlet. Nor was this altogether the result of a desire to escape,\r\nfor, feeble minded as she was, Hetty Hutter had a good deal of that\r\ninstinctive caution which so often keeps those whom God has thus visited\r\nfrom harm. She was perfectly aware of the importance of keeping the\r\ncanoes from falling into the hands of the Iroquois, and long familiarity\r\nwith the lake had suggested one of the simplest expedients, by which\r\nthis great object could be rendered compatible with her own purpose.\r\n\r\nThe point in question was the first projection that offered on that side\r\nof the lake, where a canoe, if set adrift with a southerly air would\r\nfloat clear of the land, and where it would be no great violation of\r\nprobabilities to suppose it might even hit the castle; the latter lying\r\nabove it, almost in a direct line with the wind. Such then was Hetty\'s\r\nintention, and she landed on the extremity of the gravelly point,\r\nbeneath an overhanging oak, with the express intention of shoving the\r\ncanoe off from the shore, in order that it might drift up towards her\r\nfather\'s insulated abode. She knew, too, from the logs that occasionally\r\nfloated about the lake, that did it miss the castle and its appendages\r\nthe wind would be likely to change before the canoe could reach the\r\nnorthern extremity of the lake, and that Deerslayer might have an\r\nopportunity of regaining it in the morning, when no doubt he would be\r\nearnestly sweeping the surface of the water, and the whole of its wooded\r\nshores, with glass. In all this, too, Hetty was less governed by any\r\nchain of reasoning than by her habits, the latter often supplying the\r\nplace of mind, in human beings, as they perform the same for animals of\r\nthe inferior classes.\r\n\r\nThe girl was quite an hour finding her way to the point, the distance\r\nand the obscurity equally detaining her, but she was no sooner on the\r\ngravelly beach than she prepared to set the canoe adrift, in the manner\r\nmentioned. While in the act of pushing it from her, she heard low\r\nvoices that seemed to come among the trees behind her. Startled at this\r\nunexpected danger Hetty was on the point of springing into the canoe\r\nin order to seek safety in flight, when she thought she recognized the\r\ntones of Judith\'s melodious voice. Bending forward so as to catch the\r\nsounds more directly, they evidently came from the water, and then she\r\nunderstood that the Ark was approaching from the south, and so close\r\nin with the western shore, as necessarily to cause it to pass the point\r\nwithin twenty yards of the spot where she stood. Here, then, was all she\r\ncould desire; the canoe was shoved off into the lake, leaving its late\r\noccupant alone on the narrow strand.\r\n\r\nWhen this act of self-devotion was performed, Hetty did not retire. The\r\nfoliage of the overhanging trees and bushes would have almost concealed\r\nher person, had there been light, but in that obscurity it was utterly\r\nimpossible to discover any object thus shaded, at the distance of a few\r\nfeet. Flight, too, was perfectly easy, as twenty steps would effectually\r\nbury her in the forest. She remained, therefore, watching with intense\r\nanxiety the result of her expedient, intending to call the attention\r\nof the others to the canoe with her voice, should they appear to\r\npass without observing it. The Ark approached under its sail, again,\r\nDeerslayer standing in its bow, with Judith near him, and the Delaware\r\nat the helm. It would seem that in the bay below it had got too close to\r\nthe shore, in the lingering hope of intercepting Hetty, for, as it came\r\nnearer, the latter distinctly heard the directions that the young man\r\nforward gave to his companion aft, in order to clear the point.\r\n\r\n"Lay her head more off the shore, Delaware," said Deerslayer for the\r\nthird time, speaking in English that his fair companion might understand\r\nhis words--"Lay her head well off shore. We have got embayed here, and\r\nneeds keep the mast clear of the trees. Judith, there\'s a canoe!"\r\n\r\nThe last words were uttered with great earnestness, and Deerslayer\'s\r\nhand was on his rifle ere they were fairly out of his mouth. But the\r\ntruth flashed on the mind of the quick-witted girl, and she instantly\r\ntold her companion that the boat must be that in which her sister had\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n"Keep the scow straight, Delaware; steer as straight as your bullet\r\nflies when sent ag\'in a buck; there--I have it."\r\n\r\nThe canoe was seized, and immediately secured again to the side of the\r\nArk. At the next moment the sail was lowered, and the motion of the Ark\r\narrested by means of the oars.\r\n\r\n"Hetty!" called out Judith, concern, even affection betraying itself in\r\nher tones. "Are you within hearing, sister--for God\'s sake answer, and\r\nlet me hear the sound of your voice, again! Hetty!--dear Hetty."\r\n\r\n"I\'m here, Judith--here on the shore, where it will be useless to follow\r\nme, as I will hide in the woods."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Hetty what is\'t you do! Remember \'tis drawing near midnight, and\r\nthat the woods are filled with savages and wild beasts!"\r\n\r\n"Neither will harm a poor half-witted girl, Judith. God is as much with\r\nme, here, as he would be in the Ark or in the hut. I am going to help my\r\nfather, and poor Hurry Harry, who will be tortured and slain unless some\r\none cares for them."\r\n\r\n"We all care for them, and intend to-morrow to send them a flag of\r\ntruce, to buy their ransom. Come back then, sister; trust to us, who\r\nhave better heads than you, and who will do all we can for father."\r\n\r\n"I know your head is better than mine, Judith, for mine is very weak, to\r\nbe sure; but I must go to father and poor Hurry. Do you and Deerslayer\r\nkeep the castle, sister; leave me in the hands of God."\r\n\r\n\r\n"God is with us all, Hetty--in the castle, or on the shore--father as\r\nwell as ourselves, and it is sinful not to trust to his goodness. You\r\ncan do nothing in the dark; will lose your way in the forest, and perish\r\nfor want of food."\r\n\r\n"God will not let that happen to a poor child that goes to serve her\r\nfather, sister. I must try and find the savages."\r\n\r\n"Come back for this night only; in the morning, we will put you ashore,\r\nand leave you to do as you may think right."\r\n\r\n"You say so, Judith, and you think so; but you would not. Your heart\r\nwould soften, and you\'d see tomahawks and scalping knives in the air.\r\nBesides, I\'ve got a thing to tell the Indian chief that will answer all\r\nour wishes, and I\'m afraid I may forget it, if I don\'t tell it to him at\r\nonce. You\'ll see that he will let father go, as soon as he hears it!"\r\n\r\n"Poor Hetty! What can you say to a ferocious savage that will be likely\r\nto change his bloody purpose!"\r\n\r\n"That which will frighten him, and make him let father go--" returned\r\nthe simple-minded girl, positively. "You\'ll see, sister; you\'ll see, how\r\nsoon it will bring him to, like a gentle child!"\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me, Hetty, what you intend to say?" asked Deerslayer. "I\r\nknow the savages well, and can form some idee how far fair words will be\r\nlikely, or not, to work on their bloody natur\'s. If it\'s not suited to\r\nthe gifts of a red-skin, \'twill be of no use; for reason goes by gifts,\r\nas well as conduct."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," answered Hetty, dropping her voice to a low, confidential,\r\ntone, for the stillness of the night, and the nearness of the Ark,\r\npermitted her to do this and still to be heard--"Well, then, Deerslayer,\r\nas you seem a good and honest young man I will tell you. I mean not to\r\nsay a word to any of the savages until I get face to face with their\r\nhead chief, let them plague me with as many questions as they please\r\nI\'ll answer none of them, unless it be to tell them to lead me to their\r\nwisest man--Then, Deerslayer, I\'ll tell him that God will not forgive\r\nmurder, and thefts; and that if father and Hurry did go after the\r\nscalps of the Iroquois, he must return good for evil, for so the Bible\r\ncommands, else he will go into everlasting punishment. When he hears\r\nthis, and feels it to be true, as feel it he must, how long will it be\r\nbefore he sends father, and Hurry, and me to the shore, opposite the\r\ncastle, telling us all three to go our way in peace?"\r\n\r\nThe last question was put in a triumphant manner, and then the\r\nsimple-minded girl laughed at the impression she never doubted that her\r\nproject had made on her auditors. Deerslayer was dumb-founded at this\r\nproof of guileless feebleness of mind, but Judith had suddenly bethought\r\nher of a means of counteracting this wild project, by acting on the\r\nvery feelings that had given it birth. Without adverting to the closing\r\nquestion, or the laugh, therefore, she hurriedly called to her sister by\r\nname, as one suddenly impressed with the importance of what she had to\r\nsay. But no answer was given to the call.\r\n\r\nBy the snapping of twigs, and the rustling of leaves, Hetty had\r\nevidently quitted the shore, and was already burying herself in the\r\nforest. To follow would have been fruitless, since the darkness, as\r\nwell as the dense cover that the woods everywhere offered, would have\r\nrendered her capture next to impossible, and there was also the never\r\nceasing danger of falling into the hands of their enemies. After a short\r\nand melancholy discussion, therefore, the sail was again set, and\r\nthe Ark pursued its course towards its habitual moorings, Deerslayer\r\nsilently felicitating himself on the recovery of the canoe, and brooding\r\nover his plans for the morrow. The wind rose as the party quitted the\r\npoint, and in less than an hour they reached the castle. Here all was\r\nfound as it had been left, and the reverse of the ceremonies had to\r\nbe taken in entering the building, that had been used on quitting it.\r\nJudith occupied a solitary bed that night bedewing the pillow with her\r\ntears, as she thought of the innocent and hitherto neglected creature,\r\nwho had been her companion from childhood, and bitter regrets came over\r\nher mind, from more causes than one, as the weary hours passed away,\r\nmaking it nearly morning before she lost her recollection in sleep.\r\nDeerslayer and the Delaware took their rest in the Ark, where we shall\r\nleave them enjoying the deep sleep of the honest, the healthful and\r\nfearless, to return to the girl we have last seen in the midst of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nWhen Hetty left the shore, she took her way unhesitatingly into the\r\nwoods, with a nervous apprehension of being followed. Luckily, this\r\ncourse was the best she could have hit on to effect her own purpose,\r\nsince it was the only one that led her from the point. The night was so\r\nintensely dark, beneath the branches of the trees, that her progress\r\nwas very slow, and the direction she went altogether a matter of chance,\r\nafter the first few yards. The formation of the ground, however, did not\r\npermit her to deviate far from the line in which she desired to proceed.\r\nOn one hand it was soon bounded by the acclivity of the hill, while\r\nthe lake, on the other, served as a guide. For two hours did this\r\nsingle-hearted and simple-minded girl toil through the mazes of the\r\nforest, sometimes finding herself on the brow of the bank that bounded\r\nthe water, and at others struggling up an ascent that warned her to go\r\nno farther in that direction, since it necessarily ran at right angles\r\nto the course on which she wished to proceed. Her feet often slid from\r\nbeneath her, and she got many falls, though none to do her injury; but,\r\nby the end of the period mentioned, she had become so weary as to want\r\nstrength to go any farther. Rest was indispensable, and she set about\r\npreparing a bed, with the readiness and coolness of one to whom the\r\nwilderness presented no unnecessary terrors. She knew that wild beasts\r\nroamed through all the adjacent forest, but animals that preyed on the\r\nhuman species were rare, and of dangerous serpents there were literally\r\nnone. These facts had been taught her by her father, and whatever her\r\nfeeble mind received at all, it received so confidingly as to leave her\r\nno uneasiness from any doubts, or scepticism. To her the sublimity\r\nof the solitude in which she was placed, was soothing, rather than\r\nappalling, and she gathered a bed of leaves, with as much indifference\r\nto the circumstances that would have driven the thoughts of sleep\r\nentirely from the minds of most of her sex, as if she had been preparing\r\nher place of nightly rest beneath the paternal roof. As soon as Hetty\r\nhad collected a sufficient number of the dried leaves to protect her\r\nperson from the damps of the ground, she kneeled beside the humble pile,\r\nclasped her raised hands in an attitude of deep devotion, and in a soft,\r\nlow, but audible voice repeated the Lord\'s Prayer. This was followed by\r\nthose simple and devout verses, so familiar to children, in which she\r\nrecommended her soul to God, should it be called away to another state\r\nof existence, ere the return of morning. This duty done, she lay down\r\nand disposed herself to sleep. The attire of the girl, though suited\r\nto the season, was sufficiently warm for all ordinary purposes, but the\r\nforest is ever cool, and the nights of that elevated region of country,\r\nhave always a freshness about them, that renders clothing more necessary\r\nthan is commonly the case in the summers of a low latitude. This had\r\nbeen foreseen by Hetty, who had brought with her a coarse heavy mantle,\r\nwhich, when laid over her body, answered all the useful purposes of\r\na blanket. Thus protected, she dropped asleep in a few minutes, as\r\ntranquilly as if watched over by the guardian care of that mother,\r\nwho had so recently been taken from her forever, affording in this\r\nparticular a most striking contrast between her own humble couch, and\r\nthe sleepless pillow of her sister.\r\n\r\nHour passed after hour, in a tranquility as undisturbed and a rest as\r\nsweet as if angels, expressly commissioned for that object, watched\r\naround the bed of Hetty Hutter. Not once did her soft eyes open, until\r\nthe grey of the dawn came struggling through the tops of the trees,\r\nfalling on their lids, and, united to the freshness of a summer\'s\r\nmorning, giving the usual summons to awake. Ordinarily, Hetty was up\r\nere the rays of the sun tipped the summits of the mountains, but on this\r\noccasion her fatigue had been so great, and her rest was so profound,\r\nthat the customary warnings failed of their effect. The girl murmured\r\nin her sleep, threw an arm forward, smiled as gently as an infant in\r\nits cradle, but still slumbered. In making this unconscious gesture,\r\nher hand fell on some object that was warm, and in the half unconscious\r\nstate in which she lay, she connected the circumstance with her habits.\r\nAt the next moment, a rude attack was made on her side, as if a rooting\r\nanimal were thrusting its snout beneath, with a desire to force her\r\nposition, and then, uttering the name of "Judith" she awoke. As the\r\nstartled girl arose to a sitting attitude she perceived that some dark\r\nobject sprang from her, scattering the leaves and snapping the fallen\r\ntwigs in its haste. Opening her eyes, and recovering from the first\r\nconfusion and astonishment of her situation, Hetty perceived a cub, of\r\nthe common American brown bear, balancing itself on its hinder legs, and\r\nstill looking towards her, as if doubtful whether it would be safe to\r\ntrust itself near her person again. The first impulse of Hetty, who had\r\nbeen mistress of several of these cubs, was to run and seize the little\r\ncreature as a prize, but a loud growl warned her of the danger of such\r\na procedure. Recoiling a few steps, the girl looked hurriedly round, and\r\nperceived the dam, watching her movements with fiery eyes at no great\r\ndistance. A hollow tree, that once been the home of bees, having\r\nrecently fallen, the mother with two more cubs was feasting on the\r\ndainty food that this accident had placed within her reach; while the\r\nfirst kept a jealous eye on the situation of its truant and reckless\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nIt would exceed all the means of human knowledge to presume to analyze\r\nthe influences that govern the acts of the lower animals. On this\r\noccasion, the dam, though proverbially fierce when its young is thought\r\nto be in danger, manifested no intention to attack the girl. It quitted\r\nthe honey, and advanced to a place within twenty feet of her, where it\r\nraised itself on its hind legs and balanced its body in a sort of angry,\r\ngrowling discontent, but approached no nearer. Happily, Hetty did not\r\nfly. On the contrary, though not without terror, she knelt with her face\r\ntowards the animal, and with clasped hands and uplifted eyes, repeated\r\nthe prayer of the previous night. This act of devotion was not the\r\nresult of alarm, but it was a duty she never neglected to perform\r\nere she slept, and when the return of consciousness awoke her to the\r\nbusiness of the day. As the girl arose from her knees, the bear dropped\r\non its feet again, and collecting its cubs around her, permitted them\r\nto draw their natural sustenance. Hetty was delighted with this proof of\r\ntenderness in an animal that has but a very indifferent reputation for\r\nthe gentler feelings, and as a cub would quit its mother to frisk and\r\nleap about in wantonness, she felt a strong desire again to catch it\r\nup in her arms, and play with it. But admonished by the growl, she had\r\nself-command sufficient not to put this dangerous project in execution,\r\nand recollecting her errand among the hills, she tore herself away from\r\nthe group, and proceeded on her course along the margin of the lake, of\r\nwhich she now caught glimpses again through the trees. To her surprise,\r\nthough not to her alarm, the family of bears arose and followed her\r\nsteps, keeping a short distance behind her; apparently watching every\r\nmovement as if they had a near interest in all she did.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, escorted by the dam and cubs, the girl proceeded\r\nnearly a mile, thrice the distance she had been able to achieve in the\r\ndarkness, during the same period of time. She then reached a brook that\r\nhad dug a channel for itself into the earth, and went brawling into\r\nthe lake, between steep and high banks, covered with trees. Here Hetty\r\nperformed her ablutions; then drinking of the pure mountain water, she\r\nwent her way, refreshed and lighter of heart, still attended by her\r\nsingular companions. Her course now lay along a broad and nearly level\r\nterrace, which stretched from the top of the bank that bounded the\r\nwater, to a low acclivity that rose to a second and irregular platform\r\nabove. This was at a part of the valley where the mountains ran\r\nobliquely, forming the commencement of a plain that spread between\r\nthe hills, southward of the sheet of water. Hetty knew, by this\r\ncircumstance, that she was getting near to the encampment, and had she\r\nnot, the bears would have given her warning of the vicinity of human\r\nbeings. Snuffing the air, the dam refused to follow any further, though\r\nthe girl looked back and invited her to come by childish signs, and even\r\nby direct appeals made in her own sweet voice. It was while making her\r\nway slowly through some bushes, in this manner, with averted face and\r\neyes riveted on the immovable animals, that the girl suddenly found her\r\nsteps arrested by a human hand, that was laid lightly on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Where go?--" said a soft female voice, speaking hurriedly, and in\r\nconcern.--"Indian--red man savage--wicked warrior--that-a-way."\r\n\r\nThis unexpected salutation alarmed the girl no more than the presence of\r\nthe fierce inhabitants of the woods. It took her a little by surprise,\r\nit is true, but she was in a measure prepared for some such meeting, and\r\nthe creature who stopped her was as little likely to excite terror as\r\nany who ever appeared in the guise of an Indian. It was a girl, not much\r\nolder than herself, whose smile was sunny as Judith\'s in her brightest\r\nmoments, whose voice was melody itself, and whose accents and manner had\r\nall the rebuked gentleness that characterizes the sex among a people\r\nwho habitually treat their women as the attendants and servitors of the\r\nwarriors. Beauty among the women of the aboriginal Americans, before\r\nthey have become exposed to the hardships of wives and mothers, is by no\r\nmeans uncommon. In this particular, the original owners of the country\r\nwere not unlike their more civilized successors, nature appearing to\r\nhave bestowed that delicacy of mien and outline that forms so great a\r\ncharm in the youthful female, but of which they are so early deprived;\r\nand that, too, as much by the habits of domestic life as from any other\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe girl who had so suddenly arrested the steps of Hetty was dressed\r\nin a calico mantle that effectually protected all the upper part of her\r\nperson, while a short petticoat of blue cloth edged with gold lace, that\r\nfell no lower than her knees, leggings of the same, and moccasins of\r\ndeer-skin, completed her attire. Her hair fell in long dark braids down\r\nher shoulders and back, and was parted above a low smooth forehead, in\r\na way to soften the expression of eyes that were full of archness and\r\nnatural feeling. Her face was oval, with delicate features, the teeth\r\nwere even and white, while the mouth expressed a melancholy tenderness,\r\nas if it wore this peculiar meaning in intuitive perception of the fate\r\nof a being who was doomed from birth to endure a woman\'s sufferings,\r\nrelieved by a woman\'s affections. Her voice, as has been already\r\nintimated, was soft as the sighing of the night air, a characteristic of\r\nthe females of her race, but which was so conspicuous in herself as\r\nto have produced for her the name of Wah-ta-Wah; which rendered into\r\nEnglish means Hist-oh-Hist.\r\n\r\nIn a word, this was the betrothed of Chingachgook, who--having succeeded\r\nin lulling their suspicions, was permitted to wander around the\r\nencampment of her captors. This indulgence was in accordance with the\r\ngeneral policy of the red man, who well knew, moreover, that her trail\r\ncould have been easily followed in the event of flight. It will also be\r\nremembered that the Iroquois, or Hurons, as it would be better to call\r\nthem, were entirely ignorant of the proximity of her lover, a fact,\r\nindeed, that she did not know herself.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say which manifested the most self-possession at this\r\nunexpected meeting; the pale-face, or the red girl. But, though a little\r\nsurprised, Wah-ta-Wah was the most willing to speak, and far the readier\r\nin foreseeing consequences, as well as in devising means to avert them.\r\nHer father, during her childhood, had been much employed as a warrior by\r\nthe authorities of the Colony, and dwelling for several years near the\r\nforts, she had caught a knowledge of the English tongue, which she spoke\r\nin the usual, abbreviated manner of an Indian, but fluently, and without\r\nany of the ordinary reluctance of her people.\r\n\r\n"Where go?--" repeated Wah-ta-Wah, returning the smile of Hetty, in her\r\nown gentle, winning, manner--"wicked warrior that-a-way--good warrior,\r\nfar off."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" asked Hetty, with the simplicity of a child.\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah. I no Mingo--good Delaware--Yengeese friend. Mingo cruel,\r\nand love scalp, for blood--Delaware love him, for honor. Come here,\r\nwhere no eyes."\r\n\r\nWah-ta-Wah now led her companion towards the lake, descending the bank\r\nso as to place its overhanging trees and bushes between them and any\r\nprobable observers. Nor did she stop until they were both seated, side\r\nby side, on a fallen log, one end of which actually lay buried in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"Why you come for?" the young Indian eagerly inquired--"Where you come\r\nfor?" Hetty told her tale in her own simple and truth-loving manner. She\r\nexplained the situation of her father, and stated her desire to serve\r\nhim, and if possible to procure his release.\r\n\r\n"Why your father come to Mingo camp in night?" asked the Indian girl,\r\nwith a directness, which if not borrowed from the other, partook largely\r\nof its sincerity. "He know it war-time, and he no boy--he no want\r\nbeard--no want to be told Iroquois carry tomahawk, and knife, and rifle.\r\nWhy he come night time, seize me by hair, and try to scalp Delaware\r\ngirl?"\r\n\r\n"You!" said Hetty, almost sickening with horror--"Did he seize you--did\r\nhe try to scalp you?"\r\n\r\n"Why no? Delaware scalp sell for much as Mingo scalp. Governor no tell\r\ndifference. Wicked t\'ing for pale-face to scalp. No his gifts, as the\r\ngood Deerslayer always tell me."\r\n\r\n"And do you know the Deerslayer?" said Hetty, coloring with delight and\r\nsurprise; forgetting her regrets, at the moment, in the influence of\r\nthis new feeling. "I know him, too. He is now in the Ark, with Judith\r\nand a Delaware who is called the Big Serpent. A bold and handsome\r\nwarrior is this Serpent, too!"\r\n\r\nSpite of the rich deep colour that nature had bestowed on the Indian\r\nbeauty, the tell-tale blood deepened on her cheeks, until the blush gave\r\nnew animation and intelligence to her jet-black eyes. Raising a finger\r\nin an attitude of warning, she dropped her voice, already so soft and\r\nsweet, nearly to a whisper, as she continued the discourse.\r\n\r\n"Chingachgook!" returned the Delaware girl, sighing out the harsh\r\nname, in sounds so softly guttural, as to cause it to reach the ear in\r\nmelody--"His father, Uncas--great chief of the Mahicanni--next to old\r\nTamenund!--More as warrior, not so much gray hair, and less at Council\r\nFire. You know Serpent?"\r\n\r\n"He joined us last evening, and was in the Ark with me, for two or three\r\nhours before I left it. I\'m afraid, Hist--" Hetty could not pronounce\r\nthe Indian name of her new friend, but having heard Deerslayer give her\r\nthis familiar appellation, she used it without any of the ceremony of\r\ncivilized life--"I\'m afraid Hist, he has come after scalps, as well as\r\nmy poor father and Hurry Harry."\r\n\r\n"Why he shouldn\'t--ha? Chingachgook red warrior--very red--scalp make\r\nhis honor--Be sure he take him."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Hetty, earnestly, "he will be as wicked as any other. God\r\nwill not pardon in a red man, what he will not pardon in a white man.\r\n\r\n"No true--" returned the Delaware girl, with a warmth that nearly\r\namounted to passion. "No true, I tell you! The Manitou smile and pleased\r\nwhen he see young warrior come back from the war path, with two, ten,\r\nhundred scalp on a pole! Chingachgook father take scalp--grandfather\r\ntake scalp--all old chief take scalp, and Chingachgook take as many\r\nscalp as he can carry, himself."\r\n\r\n"Then, Hist, his sleep of nights must be terrible to think of. No one\r\ncan be cruel, and hope to be forgiven."\r\n\r\n"No cruel--plenty forgiven--" returned Wah-ta-Wah, stamping her little\r\nfoot on the stony strand, and shaking her head in a way to show how\r\ncompletely feminine feeling, in one of its aspects, had gotten the\r\nbetter of feminine feeling in another. "I tell you, Serpent brave; he go\r\nhome, this time, with four,--yes--two scalp."\r\n\r\n"And is that his errand, here?--Did he really come all this distance,\r\nacross mountain, and valley, rivers and lakes, to torment his fellow\r\ncreatures, and do so wicked a thing?"\r\n\r\nThis question at once appeased the growing ire of the half-offended\r\nIndian beauty. It completely got the better of the prejudices of\r\neducation, and turned all her thoughts to a gentler and more feminine\r\nchannel. At first, she looked around her, suspiciously, as if\r\ndistrusting eavesdroppers; then she gazed wistfully into the face of her\r\nattentive companion; after which this exhibition of girlish coquetry\r\nand womanly feeling, terminated by her covering her face with both her\r\nhands, and laughing in a strain that might well be termed the melody of\r\nthe woods. Dread of discovery, however, soon put a stop to this naive\r\nexhibition of feeling, and removing her hands, this creature of impulses\r\ngazed again wistfully into the face of her companion, as if inquiring\r\nhow far she might trust a stranger with her secret. Although Hetty\r\nhad no claims to her sister\'s extraordinary beauty, many thought\r\nher countenance the most winning of the two. It expressed all the\r\nundisguised sincerity of her character, and it was totally free from\r\nany of the unpleasant physical accompaniments that so frequently attend\r\nmental imbecility. It is true that one accustomed to closer observations\r\nthan common, might have detected the proofs of her feebleness of\r\nintellect in the language of her sometimes vacant eyes, but they were\r\nsigns that attracted sympathy by their total want of guile, rather than\r\nby any other feeling. The effect on Hist, to use the English and more\r\nfamiliar translation of the name, was favorable, and yielding to an\r\nimpulse of tenderness, she threw her arms around Hetty, and embraced her\r\nwith an outpouring emotion, so natural that it was only equaled by its\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n"You good--" whispered the young Indian--"you good, I know; it so long\r\nsince Wah-ta-Wah have a friend--a sister--any body to speak her heart\r\nto! You Hist friend; don\'t I say trut\'?"\r\n\r\n"I never had a friend," answered Hetty returning the warm embrace with\r\nunfeigned earnestness. "I\'ve a sister, but no friend. Judith loves\r\nme, and I love Judith; but that\'s natural, and as we are taught in the\r\nBible--but I should like to have a friend! I\'ll be your friend, with all\r\nmy heart, for I like your voice and your smile, and your way of thinking\r\nin every thing, except about the scalps--"\r\n\r\n"No t\'ink more of him--no say more of scalp--" interrupted Hist,\r\nsoothingly--"You pale-face, I red-skin; we bring up different fashion.\r\nDeerslayer and Chingachgook great friend, and no the same colour, Hist\r\nand--what your name, pretty pale-face?"\r\n\r\n"I am called Hetty, though when they spell the name in the bible, they\r\nalways spell it Esther."\r\n\r\n"What that make?--no good, no harm. No need to spell name at\r\nall--Moravian try to make Wah-ta-Wah spell, but no won\'t let him. No\r\ngood for Delaware girl to know too much--know more than warrior some\r\ntime; that great shame. My name Wah-ta-Wah that say Hist in your tongue;\r\nyou call him, Hist--I call him, Hetty."\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries settled to their mutual satisfaction, the two girls\r\nbegan to discourse of their several hopes and projects. Hetty made her\r\nnew friend more fully acquainted with her intentions in behalf of her\r\nfather, and, to one in the least addicted to prying into the affairs,\r\nHist would have betrayed her own feelings and expectations in connection\r\nwith the young warrior of her own tribe. Enough was revealed on both\r\nsides, however, to let each party get a tolerable insight into the views\r\nof the other, though enough still remained in mental reservation,\r\nto give rise to the following questions and answers, with which the\r\ninterview in effect closed. As the quickest witted, Hist was the first\r\nwith her interrogatories. Folding an arm about the waist of Hetty, she\r\nbent her head so as to look up playfully into the face of the other,\r\nand, laughing, as if her meaning were to be extracted from her looks,\r\nshe spoke more plainly.\r\n\r\n"Hetty got broder, as well as fader?--" she said--"Why no talk of\r\nbroder, as well as fader?"\r\n\r\n"I have no brother, Hist. I had one once, they say, but he is dead many\r\na year, and lies buried in the lake, by the side of my mother."\r\n\r\n"No got broder--got a young warrior--Love him, almost as much as fader,\r\neh? Very handsome, and brave-looking; fit to be chief, if he good as he\r\nseem to be."\r\n\r\n"It\'s wicked to love any man as well as I love my father, and so I\r\nstrive not to do it, Hist," returned the conscientious Hetty, who knew\r\nnot how to conceal an emotion, by an approach to an untruth as venial as\r\nan evasion, though powerfully tempted by female shame to err, "though I\r\nsometimes think wickedness will get the better of me, if Hurry comes so\r\noften to the lake. I must tell you the truth, dear Hist, because you ask\r\nme, but I should fall down and die in the woods, if he knew it!"\r\n\r\n"Why he no ask you, himself?--Brave looking--why not bold speaking?\r\nYoung warrior ought to ask young girl, no make young girl speak first.\r\nMingo girls too shame for that."\r\n\r\nThis was said indignantly, and with the generous warmth a young female\r\nof spirit would be apt to feel, at what she deemed an invasion of\r\nher sex\'s most valued privilege. It had little influence on the\r\nsimple-minded, but also just-minded Hetty, who, though inherently\r\nfeminine in all her impulses, was much more alive to the workings of her\r\nown heart, than to any of the usages with which convention has protected\r\nthe sensitiveness of her sex.\r\n\r\n"Ask me what?\' the startled girl demanded, with a suddenness that proved\r\nhow completely her fears had been aroused. \'Ask me, if I like him as\r\nwell as I do my own father! Oh! I hope he will never put such a question\r\nto me, for I should have to answer, and that would kill me!"\r\n\r\n"No--no--no kill, quite--almost," returned the other, laughing in spite\r\nof herself. "Make blush come--make shame come too; but he no stay great\r\nwhile; then feel happier than ever. Young warrior must tell young girl\r\nhe want to make wife, else never can live in his wigwam."\r\n\r\n"Hurry don\'t want to marry me--nobody will ever want to marry me, Hist."\r\n\r\n"How you can know? P\'raps every body want to marry you, and by-and-bye,\r\ntongue say what heart feel. Why nobody want to marry you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not full witted, they say. Father often tells me this; and so does\r\nJudith, sometimes, when she is vexed; but I shouldn\'t so much mind them,\r\nas I did mother. She said so once and then she cried as if her heart\r\nwould break; and, so, I know I\'m not full witted."\r\n\r\nHist gazed at the gentle, simple girl, for quite a minute without\r\nspeaking, and then the truth appeared to flash all at once on the\r\nmind of the young Indian maid. Pity, reverence and tenderness seemed\r\nstruggling together in her breast, and then rising suddenly, she\r\nindicated a wish to her companion that she would accompany her to the\r\ncamp, which was situated at no great distance. This unexpected change\r\nfrom the precautions that Hist had previously manifested a desire to\r\nuse, in order to prevent being seen, to an open exposure of the person\r\nof her friend, arose from the perfect conviction that no Indian would\r\nharm a being whom the Great Spirit had disarmed, by depriving it of its\r\nstrongest defence, reason. In this respect, nearly all unsophisticated\r\nnations resemble each other, appearing to offer spontaneously, by\r\na feeling creditable to human nature, that protection by their own\r\nforbearance, which has been withheld by the inscrutable wisdom of\r\nProvidence. Wah-ta-Wah, indeed, knew that in many tribes the mentally\r\nimbecile and the mad were held in a species of religious reverence,\r\nreceiving from these untutored inhabitants of the forest respect and\r\nhonors, instead of the contumely and neglect that it is their fortune to\r\nmeet with among the more pretending and sophisticated.\r\n\r\nHetty accompanied her new friend without apprehension or reluctance. It\r\nwas her wish to reach the camp, and, sustained by her motives, she felt\r\nno more concern for the consequences than did her companion herself,\r\nnow the latter was apprised of the character of the protection that the\r\npale-face maiden carried with her. Still, as they proceeded slowly along\r\na shore that was tangled with overhanging bushes, Hetty continued the\r\ndiscourse, assuming the office of interrogating which the other had\r\ninstantly dropped, as soon as she ascertained the character of the mind\r\nto which her questions had been addressed.\r\n\r\n"But you are not half-witted," said Hetty, "and there\'s no reason why\r\nthe Serpent should not marry you."\r\n\r\n"Hist prisoner, and Mingo got big ear. No speak of Chingachgook when\r\nthey by. Promise Hist that, good Hetty."\r\n\r\n"I know--I know--" returned Hetty, half-whispering, in her eagerness\r\nto let the other see she understood the necessity of caution. "I\r\nknow--Deerslayer and the Serpent mean to get you away from the Iroquois,\r\nand you wish me not to tell the secret."\r\n\r\n"How you know?" said Hist, hastily, vexed at the moment that the other\r\nwas not even more feeble minded than was actually the case. "How you\r\nknow? Better not talk of any but fader and Hurry--Mingo understand\r\ndat; he no understand t\'udder. Promise you no talk about what you no\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"But I do understand this, Hist, and so I must talk about it. Deerslayer\r\nas good as told father all about it, in my presence, and as nobody\r\ntold me not to listen, I overheard it all, as I did Hurry and father\'s\r\ndiscourse about the scalps."\r\n\r\n"Very bad for pale-faces to talk about scalps, and very bad for young\r\nwoman to hear! Now you love Hist, I know, Hetty, and so, among Injins,\r\nwhen love hardest never talk most."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the way among white people, who talk most about them they\r\nlove best. I suppose it\'s because I\'m only half-witted that I don\'t see\r\nthe reason why it should be so different among red people."\r\n\r\n"That what Deerslayer call gift. One gift to talk; t\'udder gift to hold\r\ntongue. Hold tongue your gift, among Mingos. If Sarpent want to see\r\nHist, so Hetty want to see Hurry. Good girl never tell secret of\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\nHetty understood this appeal, and she promised the Delaware girl not to\r\nmake any allusion to the presence of Chingachgook, or to the motive of\r\nhis visit to the lake.\r\n\r\n"Maybe he get off Hurry and fader, as well as Hist, if let him have his\r\nway," whispered Wah-ta-Wah to her companion, in a confiding flattering\r\nway, just as they got near enough to the encampment to hear the voices\r\nof several of their own sex, who were apparently occupied in the usual\r\ntoils of women of their class. "Tink of dat, Hetty, and put two, twenty\r\nfinger on mouth. No get friend free without Sarpent do it."\r\n\r\nA better expedient could not have been adopted, to secure the silence\r\nand discretion of Hetty, than that which was now presented to her mind.\r\nAs the liberation of her father and the young frontier man was the great\r\nobject of her adventure, she felt the connection between it and the\r\nservices of the Delaware, and with an innocent laugh, she nodded her\r\nhead, and in the same suppressed manner, promised a due attention to\r\nthe wishes of her friend. Thus assured, Hist tarried no longer, but\r\nimmediately and openly led the way into the encampment of her captors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "The great King of Kings\r\n    Hath in the table of his law commanded,\r\n    That thou shalt do no murder.\r\n    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand,\r\n    To hurl upon their heads that break his law."\r\n\r\n    Richard III, I.iv.i95-97 199-200.\r\n\r\nThat the party to which Hist compulsorily belonged was not one that was\r\nregularly on the war path, was evident by the presence of females. It\r\nwas a small fragment of a tribe that had been hunting and fishing\r\nwithin the English limits, where it was found by the commencement of\r\nhostilities, and, after passing the winter and spring by living on what\r\nwas strictly the property of its enemies, it chose to strike a hostile\r\nblow before it finally retired. There was also deep Indian sagacity\r\nin the manoeuvre which had led them so far into the territory of\r\ntheir foes. When the runner arrived who announced the breaking out of\r\nhostilities between the English and French--a struggle that was certain\r\nto carry with it all the tribes that dwelt within the influence of the\r\nrespective belligerents--this particular party of the Iroquois were\r\nposted on the shores of the Oneida, a lake that lies some fifty miles\r\nnearer to their own frontier than that which is the scene of our tale.\r\n\r\nTo have fled in a direct line for the Canadas would have exposed them to\r\nthe dangers of a direct pursuit, and the chiefs had determined to adopt\r\nthe expedient of penetrating deeper into a region that had now become\r\ndangerous, in the hope of being able to retire in the rear of their\r\npursuers, instead of having them on their trail. The presence of the\r\nwomen had induced the attempt at this ruse, the strength of these\r\nfeebler members of the party being unequal to the effort of escaping\r\nfrom the pursuit of warriors. When the reader remembers the vast extent\r\nof the American wilderness, at that early day, he will perceive that\r\nit was possible for even a tribe to remain months undiscovered in\r\nparticular portions of it; nor was the danger of encountering a foe, the\r\nusual precautions being observed, as great in the woods, as it is on the\r\nhigh seas, in a time of active warfare.\r\n\r\nThe encampment being temporary, it offered to the eye no more than the\r\nrude protection of a bivouac, relieved in some slight degree by the\r\ningenious expedients which suggested themselves to the readiness of\r\nthose who passed their lives amid similar scenes. One fire, that had\r\nbeen kindled against the roots of a living oak, sufficed for the whole\r\nparty; the weather being too mild to require it for any purpose but\r\ncooking. Scattered around this centre of attraction, were some fifteen\r\nor twenty low huts, or perhaps kennels would be a better word, into\r\nwhich their different owners crept at night, and which were also\r\nintended to meet the exigencies of a storm.\r\n\r\nThese little huts were made of the branches of trees, put together with\r\nsome ingenuity, and they were uniformly topped with bark that had been\r\nstripped from fallen trees; of which every virgin forest possesses\r\nhundreds, in all stages of decay. Of furniture they had next to none.\r\nCooking utensils of the simplest sort were lying near the fire, a few\r\narticles of clothing were to be seen in or around the huts, rifles,\r\nhorns, and pouches leaned against the trees, or were suspended from the\r\nlower branches, and the carcasses of two or three deer were stretched to\r\nview on the same natural shambles.\r\n\r\nAs the encampment was in the midst of a dense wood, the eye could not\r\ntake in its tout ensemble at a glance, but hut after hut started out of\r\nthe gloomy picture, as one gazed about him in quest of objects. There\r\nwas no centre, unless the fire might be so considered, no open area\r\nwhere the possessors of this rude village might congregate, but all was\r\ndark, covert and cunning, like its owners. A few children strayed from\r\nhut to hut, giving the spot a little of the air of domestic life, and\r\nthe suppressed laugh and low voices of the women occasionally broke\r\nin upon the deep stillness of the sombre forest. As for the men, they\r\neither ate, slept, or examined their arms. They conversed but little,\r\nand then usually apart, or in groups withdrawn from the females, whilst\r\nan air of untiring, innate watchfulness and apprehension of danger\r\nseemed to be blended even with their slumbers.\r\n\r\nAs the two girls came near the encampment, Hetty uttered a slight\r\nexclamation, on catching a view of the person of her father. He was\r\nseated on the ground with his back to a tree, and Hurry stood near him\r\nindolently whittling a twig. Apparently they were as much at liberty as\r\nany others in or about the camp, and one unaccustomed to Indian usages\r\nwould have mistaken them for visitors, instead of supposing them to\r\nbe captives. Wah-ta-Wah led her new friend quite near them, and then\r\nmodestly withdrew, that her own presence might be no restraint on her\r\nfeelings. But Hetty was not sufficiently familiar with caresses or\r\noutward demonstrations of fondness, to indulge in any outbreaking of\r\nfeeling. She merely approached and stood at her father\'s side without\r\nspeaking, resembling a silent statue of filial affection. The old man\r\nexpressed neither alarm nor surprise at her sudden appearance. In these\r\nparticulars he had caught the stoicism of the Indians, well knowing\r\nthat there was no more certain mode of securing their respect than by\r\nimitating their self-command. Nor did the savages themselves betray the\r\nleast sign of surprise at this sudden appearance of a stranger among\r\nthem. In a word, this arrival produced much less visible sensation,\r\nthough occurring under circumstances so peculiar, than would be seen in\r\na village of higher pretensions to civilization did an ordinary traveler\r\ndrive up to the door of its principal inn.\r\n\r\nStill a few warriors collected, and it was evident by the manner in\r\nwhich they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together, that she was\r\nthe subject of their discourse, and probable that the reasons of her\r\nunlooked-for appearance were matters of discussion. This phlegm of\r\nmanner is characteristic of the North American Indian--some say of his\r\nwhite successor also--but, in this case much should be attributed to the\r\npeculiar situation in which the party was placed. The force in the Ark,\r\nthe presence of Chingachgook excepted, was well known, no tribe or body\r\nof troops was believed to be near, and vigilant eyes were posted round\r\nthe entire lake, watching day and night the slightest movement of those\r\nwhom it would not be exaggerated now to term the besieged.\r\n\r\nHutter was inwardly much moved by the conduct of Hetty, though he\r\naffected so much indifference of manner. He recollected her gentle\r\nappeal to him before he left the Ark, and misfortune rendered that of\r\nweight which might have been forgotten amid the triumph of success. Then\r\nhe knew the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child, and understood\r\nwhy she had come, and the total disregard of self that reigned in all\r\nher acts.\r\n\r\n"This is not well, Hetty," he said, deprecating the consequences to the\r\ngirl herself more than any other evil. "These are fierce Iroquois, and\r\nare as little apt to forget an injury, as a favor."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, father--" returned the girl, looking furtively about her as\r\nif fearful of being overheard, "did God let you do the cruel errand\r\non which you came? I want much to know this, that I may speak to the\r\nIndians plainly, if he did not."\r\n\r\n"You should not have come hither, Hetty; these brutes will not\r\nunderstand your nature or your intentions!"\r\n\r\n"How was it, father; neither you nor Hurry seems to have any thing that\r\nlooks like scalps."\r\n\r\n"If that will set your mind at peace, child, I can answer you, no. I had\r\ncaught the young creatur\' who came here with you, but her screeches soon\r\nbrought down upon me a troop of the wild cats, that was too much for any\r\nsingle Christian to withstand. If that will do you any good, we are as\r\ninnocent of having taken a scalp, this time, as I make no doubt we shall\r\nalso be innocent of receiving the bounty."\r\n\r\n"Thank God for that, father! Now I can speak boldly to the Iroquois, and\r\nwith an easy conscience. I hope Hurry, too, has not been able to harm\r\nany of the Indians?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that matter, Hetty," returned the individual in question,\r\n"you\'ve put it pretty much in the natyve character of the religious\r\ntruth. Hurry has not been able, and that is the long and short of it.\r\nI\'ve seen many squalls, old fellow, both on land and on the water, but\r\nnever did I feel one as lively and as snappish as that which come down\r\nupon us, night afore last, in the shape of an Indian hurrah-boys! Why,\r\nHetty, you\'re no great matter at a reason, or an idee that lies a little\r\ndeeper than common, but you\'re human and have some human notions--now\r\nI\'ll just ask you to look at them circumstances. Here was old Tom, your\r\nfather, and myself, bent on a legal operation, as is to be seen in the\r\nwords of the law and the proclamation; thinking no harm; when we were\r\nset upon by critturs that were more like a pack of hungry wolves than\r\nmortal savages even, and there they had us tethered like two sheep, in\r\nless time than it has taken me to tell you the story."\r\n\r\n"You are free now, Hurry," returned Hetty, glancing timidly at the fine\r\nunfettered limbs of the young giant--"You have no cords, or withes, to\r\npain your arms, or legs, now."\r\n\r\n"Not I, Hetty. Natur\' is natur\', and freedom is natur\', too. My limbs\r\nhave a free look, but that\'s pretty much the amount of it, sin\' I can\'t\r\nuse them in the way I should like. Even these trees have eyes; ay, and\r\ntongues too; for was the old man, here, or I, to start one single rod\r\nbeyond our gaol limits, sarvice would be put on the bail afore we could\r\n\'gird up our loins\' for a race, and, like as not, four or five rifle\r\nbullets would be travelling arter us, carrying so many invitations to\r\ncurb our impatience. There isn\'t a gaol in the colony as tight as this\r\nwe are now in; for I\'ve tried the vartues of two or three on \'em, and I\r\nknow the mater\'als they are made of, as well as the men that made \'em;\r\ntakin\' down being the next step in schoolin\', to puttin\' up, in all such\r\nfabrications."\r\n\r\nLest the reader should get an exaggerated opinion of Hurry\'s demerits\r\nfrom this boastful and indiscreet revelation, it may be well to say that\r\nhis offences were confined to assaults and batteries, for several\r\nof which he had been imprisoned, when, as he has just said, he often\r\nescaped by demonstrating the flimsiness of the constructions in which he\r\nwas confined, by opening for himself doors in spots where the architects\r\nhad neglected to place them. But Hetty had no knowledge of gaols, and\r\nlittle of the nature of crimes, beyond what her unadulterated and almost\r\ninstinctive perceptions of right and wrong taught her, and this sally\r\nof the rude being who had spoken was lost upon her. She understood his\r\ngeneral meaning, however, and answered in reference to that alone.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so best, Hurry," she said. "It is best father and you should be\r\nquiet and peaceable, \'till I have spoken to the Iroquois, when all will\r\nbe well and happy. I don\'t wish either of you to follow, but leave me to\r\nmyself. As soon as all is settled, and you are at liberty to go back to\r\nthe castle, I will come and let you know it."\r\n\r\nHetty spoke with so much simple earnestness, seemed so confident of\r\nsuccess, and wore so high an air of moral feeling and truth, that\r\nboth the listeners felt more disposed to attach an importance to her\r\nmediation, than might otherwise have happened. When she manifested an\r\nintention to quit them, therefore, they offered no obstacle, though they\r\nsaw she was about to join the group of chiefs who were consulting apart,\r\nseemingly on the manner and motive of her own sudden appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen Hist--for so we love best to call her--quitted her companion, she\r\nstrayed near one or two of the elder warriors, who had shown her most\r\nkindness in her captivity, the principal man of whom had even offered to\r\nadopt her as his child if she would consent to become a Huron. In taking\r\nthis direction, the shrewd girl did so to invite inquiry. She was too\r\nwell trained in the habits of her people to obtrude the opinions of one\r\nof her sex and years on men and warriors, but nature had furnished\r\na tact and ingenuity that enabled her to attract the attention she\r\ndesired, without wounding the pride of those to whom it was her duty to\r\ndefer and respect. Even her affected indifference stimulated curiosity,\r\nand Hetty had hardly reached the side of her father, before the Delaware\r\ngirl was brought within the circle of the warriors, by a secret but\r\nsignificant gesture. Here she was questioned as to the person of her\r\ncompanion, and the motives that had brought her to the camp. This\r\nwas all that Hist desired. She explained the manner in which she had\r\ndetected the weakness of Hetty\'s reason, rather exaggerating than\r\nlessening the deficiency in her intellect, and then she related in\r\ngeneral terms the object of the girl in venturing among her enemies.\r\nThe effect was all that the speaker expected, her account investing the\r\nperson and character of their visitor with a sacredness and respect that\r\nshe well knew would prove her protection. As soon as her own purpose was\r\nattained, Hist withdrew to a distance, where, with female consideration\r\nand a sisterly tenderness she set about the preparation of a meal, to be\r\noffered to her new friend as soon as the latter might be at liberty to\r\npartake of it. While thus occupied, however, the ready girl in no degree\r\nrelaxed in her watchfulness, noting every change of countenance among\r\nthe chiefs, every movement of Hetty\'s, and the smallest occurrence that\r\ncould be likely to affect her own interests, or that of her new friend.\r\n\r\nAs Hetty approached the chiefs they opened their little circle, with an\r\nease and deference of manner that would have done credit to men of more\r\ncourtly origin. A fallen tree lay near, and the oldest of the warriors\r\nmade a quiet sign for the girl to be seated on it, taking his place at\r\nher side with the gentleness of a father. The others arranged themselves\r\naround the two with grave dignity, and then the girl, who had sufficient\r\nobservation to perceive that such a course was expected of her, began\r\nto reveal the object of her visit. The moment she opened her mouth to\r\nspeak, however, the old chief gave a gentle sign for her to forbear,\r\nsaid a few words to one of his juniors, and then waited in silent\r\npatience until the latter had summoned Hist to the party. This\r\ninterruption proceeded from the chief\'s having discovered that there\r\nexisted a necessity for an interpreter, few of the Hurons present\r\nunderstanding the English language, and they but imperfectly.\r\n\r\nWah-ta-Wah was not sorry to be called upon to be present at the\r\ninterview, and least of all in the character in which she was now\r\nwanted. She was aware of the hazards she ran in attempting to deceive\r\none or two of the party, but was none the less resolved to use every\r\nmeans that offered, and to practice every artifice that an Indian\r\neducation could supply, to conceal the facts of the vicinity of her\r\nbetrothed, and of the errand on which he had come. One unpracticed in\r\nthe expedients and opinions of savage life would not have suspected the\r\nreadiness of invention, the wariness of action, the high resolution, the\r\nnoble impulses, the deep self-devotion, and the feminine disregard of\r\nself when the affections were concerned, that lay concealed beneath the\r\ndemure looks, the mild eyes, and the sunny smiles of this young Indian\r\nbeauty. As she approached them, the grim old warriors regarded her with\r\npleasure, for they had a secret pride in the hope of engrafting so rare\r\na scion on the stock of their own nation; adoption being as regularly\r\npractised, and as distinctly recognized among the tribes of America,\r\nas it ever had been among those nations that submit to the sway of the\r\nCivil Law.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hist was seated by the side of Hetty, the old chief desired\r\nher to ask "the fair young pale-face" what had brought her among the\r\nIroquois, and what they could do to serve her.\r\n\r\n"Tell them, Hist, who I am--Thomas Hutter\'s youngest daughter; Thomas\r\nHutter, the oldest of their two prisoners; he who owns the castle and\r\nthe Ark, and who has the best right to be thought the owner of these\r\nhills, and that lake, since he has dwelt so long, and trapped so long,\r\nand fished so long, among them--They\'ll know whom you mean by Thomas\r\nHutter, if you tell them, that. And then tell them that I\'ve come here\r\nto convince them they ought not to harm father and Hurry, but let them\r\ngo in peace, and to treat them as brethren rather than as enemies. Now\r\ntell them all this plainly, Hist, and fear nothing for yourself or me.\r\nGod will protect us."\r\n\r\nWah-ta-Wah did as the other desired, taking care to render the words of\r\nher friend as literally as possible into the Iroquois tongue, a language\r\nshe used with a readiness almost equal to that with which she spoke her\r\nown. The chiefs heard this opening explanation with grave decorum, the\r\ntwo who had a little knowledge of English intimating their satisfaction\r\nwith the interpreter by furtive but significant glances of the eyes.\r\n\r\n"And, now, Hist," continued Hetty, as soon as it was intimated to her\r\nthat she might proceed, "and, now, Hist, I wish you to tell these red\r\nmen, word for word, what I am about to say. Tell them first, that father\r\nand Hurry came here with an intention to take as many scalps as they\r\ncould, for the wicked governor and the province have offered money for\r\nscalps, whether of warriors, or women, men or children, and the love of\r\ngold was too strong for their hearts to withstand it. Tell them this,\r\ndear Hist, just as you have heard it from me, word for word."\r\n\r\nWah-ta-Wah hesitated about rendering this speech as literally as had\r\nbeen desired, but detecting the intelligence of those who understood\r\nEnglish, and apprehending even a greater knowledge than they actually\r\npossessed she found herself compelled to comply. Contrary to what a\r\ncivilized man would have expected, the admission of the motives and of\r\nthe errands of their prisoners produced no visible effect on either the\r\ncountenances or the feelings of the listeners. They probably considered\r\nthe act meritorious, and that which neither of them would have hesitated\r\nto perform in his own person, he would not be apt to censure in another.\r\n\r\n"And, now, Hist," resumed Hetty, as soon as she perceived that her first\r\nspeeches were understood by the chiefs, "you can tell them more. They\r\nknow that father and Hurry did not succeed, and therefore they can bear\r\nthem no grudge for any harm that has been done. If they had slain their\r\nchildren and wives it would not alter the matter, and I\'m not certain\r\nthat what I am about to tell them would not have more weight had there\r\nbeen mischief done. But ask them first, Hist, if they know there is a\r\nGod, who reigns over the whole earth, and is ruler and chief of all who\r\nlive, let them be red, or white, or what color they may?"\r\n\r\nWah-ta-Wah looked a little surprised at this question, for the idea of\r\nthe Great Spirit is seldom long absent from the mind of an Indian girl.\r\nShe put the question as literally as possible, however, and received a\r\ngrave answer in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n"This is right," continued Hetty, "and my duty will now be light. This\r\nGreat Spirit, as you call our God, has caused a book to be written,\r\nthat we call a Bible, and in this book have been set down all his\r\ncommandments, and his holy will and pleasure, and the rules by which all\r\nmen are to live, and directions how to govern the thoughts even, and\r\nthe wishes, and the will. Here, this is one of these holy books, and\r\nyou must tell the chiefs what I am about to read to them from its sacred\r\npages."\r\n\r\nAs Hetty concluded, she reverently unrolled a small English Bible from\r\nits envelope of coarse calico, treating the volume with the sort of\r\nexternal respect that a Romanist would be apt to show to a religious\r\nrelic. As she slowly proceeded in her task the grim warriors watched\r\neach movement with riveted eyes, and when they saw the little volume\r\nappear a slight expression of surprise escaped one or two of them. But\r\nHetty held it out towards them in triumph, as if she expected the sight\r\nwould produce a visible miracle, and then, without betraying either\r\nsurprise or mortification at the Stoicism of the Indian, she turned\r\neagerly to her new friend, in order to renew the discourse.\r\n\r\n"This is the sacred volume, Hist," she said--"and these words, and\r\nlines, and verses, and chapters, all came from God."\r\n\r\n"Why Great Spirit no send book to Injin, too?" demanded Hist, with the\r\ndirectness of a mind that was totally unsophisticated.\r\n\r\n"Why?" answered Hetty, a little bewildered by a question so unexpected.\r\n"Why?--Ah! you know the Indians don\'t know how to read."\r\n\r\nIf Hist was not satisfied with this explanation, she did not deem the\r\npoint of sufficient importance to be pressed. Simply bending her body,\r\nin a gentle admission of the truth of what she heard, she sat patiently\r\nawaiting the further arguments of the pale-face enthusiast.\r\n\r\n"You can tell these chiefs that throughout this book, men are ordered to\r\nforgive their enemies; to treat them as they would brethren; and never\r\nto injure their fellow creatures, more especially on account of revenge\r\nor any evil passions. Do you think you can tell them this, so that they\r\nwill understand it, Hist?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him well enough, but he no very easy to understand." Hist then\r\nconveyed the ideas of Hetty, in the best manner she could, to the\r\nattentive Indians, who heard her words with some such surprise as an\r\nAmerican of our own times would be apt to betray at a suggestion that\r\nthe great modern but vacillating ruler of things human, public opinion,\r\nmight be wrong. One or two of their number, however, having met with\r\nmissionaries, said a few words in explanation, and then the group gave\r\nall its attention to the communications that were to follow. Before\r\nHetty resumed she inquired earnestly of Hist if the chiefs had\r\nunderstood her, and receiving an evasive answer, was fain to be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"I will now read to the warriors some of the verses that it is good for\r\nthem to know," continued the girl, whose manner grew more solemn and\r\nearnest as she proceeded--"and they will remember that they are the very\r\nwords of the Great Spirit. First, then, ye are commanded to \'love thy\r\nneighbor as Thyself.\' Tell them that, dear Hist."\r\n\r\n"Neighbor, for Injin, no mean pale-face," answered the Delaware girl,\r\nwith more decision than she had hitherto thought it necessary to use.\r\n"Neighbor mean Iroquois for Iroquois, Mohican for Mohican, Pale-face for\r\npale face. No need tell chief any thing else."\r\n\r\n"You forget, Hist, these are the words of the Great Spirit, and\r\nthe chiefs must obey them as well as others. Here is another\r\ncommandment--\'Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him\r\nthe other also.\'"\r\n\r\n"What that mean?" demanded Hist, with the quickness of lightning.\r\n\r\nHetty explained that it was an order not to resent injuries, but rather\r\nto submit to receive fresh wrongs from the offender.\r\n\r\n"And hear this, too, Hist," she added. "\'Love your enemies, bless them\r\nthat curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which\r\ndespitefully use you and persecute you.\'"\r\n\r\nBy this time Hetty had become excited; her eye gleamed with the\r\nearnestness of her feelings, her cheeks flushed, and her voice, usually\r\nso low and modulated, became stronger and more impressive. With the\r\nBible she had been early made familiar by her mother, and she now turned\r\nfrom passage to passage with surprising rapidity, taking care to cull\r\nsuch verses as taught the sublime lessons of Christian charity and\r\nChristian forgiveness. To translate half she said, in her pious\r\nearnestness, Wah-ta-Wah would have found impracticable, had she made the\r\neffort, but wonder held her tongue tied, equally with the chiefs, and\r\nthe young, simple-minded enthusiast had fairly become exhausted with\r\nher own efforts, before the other opened her mouth, again, to utter a\r\nsyllable. Then, indeed, the Delaware girl gave a brief translation of\r\nthe substance of what had been both read and said, confining herself to\r\none or two of the more striking of the verses, those that had struck her\r\nown imagination as the most paradoxical, and which certainly would have\r\nbeen the most applicable to the case, could the uninstructed minds of\r\nthe listeners embrace the great moral truths they conveyed.\r\n\r\nIt will be scarcely necessary to tell the reader the effect that\r\nsuch novel duties would be likely to produce among a group of Indian\r\nwarriors, with whom it was a species of religious principle never to\r\nforget a benefit, or to forgive an injury. Fortunately, the previous\r\nexplanations of Hist had prepared the minds of the Hurons for something\r\nextravagant, and most of that which to them seemed inconsistent and\r\nparadoxical, was accounted for by the fact that the speaker possessed\r\na mind that was constituted differently from those of most of the\r\nhuman race. Still there were one or two old men who had heard similar\r\ndoctrines from the missionaries, and these felt a desire to occupy an\r\nidle moment by pursuing a subject that they found so curious.\r\n\r\n"This is the Good Book of the pale-faces," observed one of these\r\nchiefs, taking the volume from the unresisting hands of Hetty, who gazed\r\nanxiously at his face while he turned the leaves, as if she expected to\r\nwitness some visible results from the circumstance. "This is the law by\r\nwhich my white brethren professes to live?"\r\n\r\nHist, to whom this question was addressed, if it might be considered as\r\naddressed to any one, in particular, answered simply in the affirmative;\r\nadding that both the French of the Canadas, and the Yengeese of the\r\nBritish provinces equally admitted its authority, and affected to revere\r\nits principles.\r\n\r\n"Tell my young sister," said the Huron, looking directly at Hist, "that\r\nI will open my mouth and say a few words."\r\n\r\n"The Iroquois chief go to speak--my pale-face friend listen," said Hist.\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear it!" exclaimed Hetty. "God has touched his heart, and\r\nhe will now let father and Hurry go."\r\n\r\n"This is the pale-face law," resumed the chief. "It tells him to do good\r\nto them that hurt him, and when his brother asks him for his rifle to\r\ngive him the powder horn, too. Such is the pale-face law?"\r\n\r\n"Not so--not so--" answered Hetty earnestly, when these words had been\r\ninterpreted--"There is not a word about rifles in the whole book, and\r\npowder and bullets give offence to the Great Spirit."\r\n\r\n"Why then does the pale-face use them? If he is ordered to give double\r\nto him that asks only for one thing, why does he take double from the\r\npoor Indian who ask for no thing. He comes from beyond the rising sun,\r\nwith this book in his hand, and he teaches the red man to read it, but\r\nwhy does he forget himself all it says? When the Indian gives, he is\r\nnever satisfied; and now he offers gold for the scalps of our women and\r\nchildren, though he calls us beasts if we take the scalp of a warrior\r\nkilled in open war. My name is Rivenoak."\r\n\r\nWhen Hetty had got this formidable question fairly presented to her mind\r\nin the translation, and Hist did her duty with more than usual\r\nreadiness on this occasion, it scarcely need be said that she was sorely\r\nperplexed. Abler heads than that of this poor girl have frequently been\r\npuzzled by questions of a similar drift, and it is not surprising that\r\nwith all her own earnestness and sincerity she did not know what answer\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n"What shall I tell them, Hist," she asked imploringly--"I know that all\r\nI have read from the book is true, and yet it wouldn\'t seem so, would\r\nit, by the conduct of those to whom the book was given?"\r\n\r\n"Give \'em pale-face reason," returned Hist, ironically--"that always\r\ngood for one side; though he bad for t\'other."\r\n\r\n"No--no--Hist, there can\'t be two sides to truth--and yet it does seem\r\nstrange! I\'m certain I have read the verses right, and no one would be\r\nso wicked as to print the word of God wrong. That can never be, Hist."\r\n\r\n"Well, to poor Injin girl, it seem every thing can be to pale-faces,"\r\nreturned the other, coolly. "One time \'ey say white, and one time \'ey\r\nsay black. Why never can be?"\r\n\r\nHetty was more and more embarrassed, until overcome with the\r\napprehension that she had failed in her object, and that the lives of\r\nher father and Hurry would be the forfeit of some blunder of her own,\r\nshe burst into tears. From that moment the manner of Hist lost all its\r\nirony and cool indifference, and she became the fond caressing friend\r\nagain. Throwing her arms around the afflicted girl, she attempted\r\nto soothe her sorrows by the scarcely ever failing remedy of female\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n"Stop cry--no cry--" she said, wiping the tears from the face of Hetty,\r\nas she would have performed the same office for a child, and stopping\r\nto press her occasionally to her own warm bosom with the affection of\r\na sister. "Why you so trouble? You no make he book, if he be wrong, and\r\nyou no make he pale-face if he wicked. There wicked red man, and wicked\r\nwhite man--no colour all good--no colour all wicked. Chiefs know that\r\nwell enough."\r\n\r\nHetty soon recovered from this sudden burst of grief, and then her\r\nmind reverted to the purpose of her visit, with all its single-hearted\r\nearnestness. Perceiving that the grim looking chiefs were still standing\r\naround her in grave attention, she hoped that another effort to convince\r\nthem of the right might be successful. "Listen, Hist," she said,\r\nstruggling to suppress her sobs, and to speak distinctly--"Tell the\r\nchiefs that it matters not what the wicked do--right is right--The words\r\nof The Great Spirit are the words of The Great Spirit--and no one can go\r\nharmless for doing an evil act, because another has done it before him.\r\n\'Render good for evil,\' says this book, and that is the law for the red\r\nman as well as for the white man."\r\n\r\n"Never hear such law among Delaware, or among Iroquois--" answered\r\nHist soothingly. "No good to tell chiefs any such laws as dat. Tell \'em\r\nsomet\'ing they believe."\r\n\r\nHist was about to proceed, notwithstanding, when a tap on the shoulder\r\nfrom the finger of the oldest chief caused her to look up. She then\r\nperceived that one of the warriors had left the group, and was already\r\nreturning to it with Hutter and Hurry. Understanding that the two\r\nlast were to become parties in the inquiry, she became mute, with\r\nthe unhesitating obedience of an Indian woman. In a few seconds the\r\nprisoners stood face to face with the principal men of the captors.\r\n\r\n"Daughter," said the senior chief to the young Delaware, "ask this grey\r\nbeard why he came into our camp?"\r\n\r\nThe question was put by Hist, in her own imperfect English, but in a\r\nway that was easy to be understood. Hutter was too stern and obdurate\r\nby nature to shrink from the consequences of any of his acts, and he\r\nwas also too familiar with the opinions of the savages not to understand\r\nthat nothing was to be gained by equivocation or an unmanly dread of\r\ntheir anger. Without hesitating, therefore, he avowed the purpose\r\nwith which he had landed, merely justifying it by the fact that the\r\ngovernment of the province had bid high for scalps. This frank avowal\r\nwas received by the Iroquois with evident satisfaction, not so much,\r\nhowever, on account of the advantage it gave them in a moral point of\r\nview, as by its proving that they had captured a man worthy of occupying\r\ntheir thoughts and of becoming a subject of their revenge. Hurry,\r\nwhen interrogated, confessed the truth, though he would have been\r\nmore disposed to concealment than his sterner companion, did the\r\ncircumstances very well admit of its adoption. But he had tact enough to\r\ndiscover that equivocation would be useless, at that moment, and he made\r\na merit of necessity by imitating a frankness, which, in the case\r\nof Hutter, was the offspring of habits of indifference acting on\r\na disposition that was always ruthless, and reckless of personal\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chiefs had received the answers to their questions, they\r\nwalked away in silence, like men who deemed the matter disposed of,\r\nall Hetty\'s dogmas being thrown away on beings trained in violence from\r\ninfancy to manhood. Hetty and Hist were now left alone with Hutter and\r\nHurry, no visible restraint being placed on the movements of either;\r\nthough all four, in fact, were vigilantly and unceasingly watched. As\r\nrespects the men, care was had to prevent them from getting possession\r\nof any of the rifles that lay scattered about, their own included; and\r\nthere all open manifestations of watchfulness ceased. But they, who\r\nwere so experienced in Indian practices, knew too well how great was the\r\ndistance between appearances and reality, to become the dupes of this\r\nseeming carelessness. Although both thought incessantly of the means of\r\nescape, and this without concert, each was aware of the uselessness\r\nof attempting any project of the sort that was not deeply laid, and\r\npromptly executed. They had been long enough in the encampment, and were\r\nsufficiently observant to have ascertained that Hist, also, was a sort\r\nof captive, and, presuming on the circumstance, Hutter spoke in her\r\npresence more openly than he might otherwise have thought it prudent to\r\ndo; inducing Hurry to be equally unguarded by his example.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not blame you, Hetty, for coming on this errand, which was well\r\nmeant if not very wisely planned," commenced the father, seating himself\r\nby the side of his daughter and taking her hand; a sign of affection\r\nthat this rude being was accustomed to manifest to this particular\r\nchild. "But preaching, and the Bible, are not the means to turn an\r\nIndian from his ways. Has Deerslayer sent any message; or has he any\r\nscheme by which he thinks to get us free?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s the substance of it!" put in Hurry. "If you can help us,\r\ngal, to half a mile of freedom, or even a good start of a short quarter,\r\nI\'ll answer for the rest. Perhaps the old man may want a little more,\r\nbut for one of my height and years that will meet all objections."\r\n\r\nHetty looked distressed, turning her eyes from one to the other, but she\r\nhad no answer to give to the question of the reckless Hurry.\r\n\r\n"Father," she said, "neither Deerslayer nor Judith knew of my coming\r\nuntil I had left the Ark. They are afraid the Iroquois will make a raft\r\nand try to get off to the hut, and think more of defending that than of\r\ncoming to aid you."\r\n\r\n"No--no--no--" said Hist hurriedly, though in a low voice, and with her\r\nface bent towards the earth, in order to conceal from those whom\r\nshe knew to be watching them the fact of her speaking at all.\r\n"No--no--no--Deerslayer different man. He no t\'ink of defending \'self,\r\nwith friend in danger. Help one another, and all get to hut."\r\n\r\n"This sounds well, old Tom," said Hurry, winking and laughing, though he\r\ntoo used the precaution to speak low--"Give me a ready witted squaw\r\nfor a fri\'nd, and though I\'ll not downright defy an Iroquois, I think I\r\nwould defy the devil."\r\n\r\n"No talk loud," said Hist. "Some Iroquois got Yengeese tongue, and all\r\ngot Yengeese ear."\r\n\r\n"Have we a friend in you, young woman?" enquired Hutter with an\r\nincreasing interest in the conference. "If so, you may calculate on a\r\nsolid reward, and nothing will be easier than to send you to your own\r\ntribe, if we can once fairly get you off with us to the castle. Give us\r\nthe Ark and the canoes, and we can command the lake, spite of all the\r\nsavages in the Canadas. Nothing but artillery could drive us out of the\r\ncastle, if we can get back to it.\r\n\r\n"S\'pose \'ey come ashore to take scalp?" retorted Hist, with cool irony,\r\nat which the girl appeared to be more expert than is common for her sex.\r\n\r\n"Ay--ay--that was a mistake; but there is little use in lamentations,\r\nand less still, young woman, in flings."\r\n\r\n"Father," said Hetty, "Judith thinks of breaking open the big chest,\r\nin hopes of finding something in that which may buy your freedom of the\r\nsavages."\r\n\r\nA dark look came over Hutter at the announcement of this fact, and he\r\nmuttered his dissatisfaction in a way to render it intelligible enough.\r\n\r\n"What for no break open chest?" put in Hist. "Life sweeter than old\r\nchest--scalp sweeter than old chest. If no tell darter to break him\r\nopen, Wah-ta-Wah no help him to run away."\r\n\r\n"Ye know not what ye ask--ye are but silly girls, and the wisest way for\r\nye both is to speak of what ye understand and to speak of nothing else.\r\nI little like this cold neglect of the savages, Hurry; it\'s a proof that\r\nthey think of something serious, and if we are to do any thing, we must\r\ndo it soon. Can we count on this young woman, think you?"\r\n\r\n"Listen--" said Hist quickly, and with an earnestness that proved how\r\nmuch her feelings were concerned--"Wah-ta-Wah no Iroquois--All over\r\nDelaware--got Delaware heart--Delaware feeling. She prisoner, too. One\r\nprisoner help t\'udder prisoner. No good to talk more, now. Darter stay\r\nwith fader--Wah-ta-Wah come and see friend--all look right--Then tell\r\nwhat he do."\r\n\r\nThis was said in a low voice, but distinctly, and in a manner to make an\r\nimpression. As soon as it was uttered the girl arose and left the\r\ngroup, walking composedly towards the hut she occupied, as if she had no\r\nfurther interest in what might pass between the pale-faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "She speaks much of her father; says she hears,\r\n    There\'s tricks i\' the world; and hems, and beats her breast;\r\n    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,\r\n    That carry but half sense; her speech is nothing,\r\n    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move\r\n    The hearers to collection;"\r\n\r\n    Hamlet, IV.v.4-9.\r\n\r\nWe left the occupants of the castle and the ark, buried in sleep. Once,\r\nor twice, in the course of the night, it is true, Deerslayer or the\r\nDelaware, arose and looked out upon the tranquil lake; when, finding\r\nall safe, each returned to his pallet, and slept like a man who was not\r\neasily deprived of his natural rest. At the first signs of the dawn the\r\nformer arose, however, and made his personal arrangements for the day;\r\nthough his companion, whose nights had not been tranquil or without\r\ndisturbances of late, continued on his blanket until the sun had fairly\r\nrisen; Judith, too, was later than common that morning, for the earlier\r\nhours of the night had brought her little of either refreshment or\r\nsleep. But ere the sun had shown himself over the eastern hills these\r\ntoo were up and afoot, even the tardy in that region seldom remaining on\r\ntheir pallets after the appearance of the great luminary. Chingachgook\r\nwas in the act of arranging his forest toilet, when Deerslayer entered\r\nthe cabin of the Ark and threw him a few coarse but light summer\r\nvestments that belonged to Hutter.\r\n\r\n"Judith hath given me them for your use, chief," said the latter, as he\r\ncast the jacket and trousers at the feet of the Indian, "for it\'s ag\'in\r\nall prudence and caution to be seen in your war dress and paint. Wash\r\noff all them fiery streaks from your cheeks, put on these garments, and\r\nhere is a hat, such as it is, that will give you an awful oncivilized\r\nsort of civilization, as the missionaries call it. Remember that Hist is\r\nat hand, and what we do for the maiden must be done while we are\r\ndoing for others. I know it\'s ag\'in your gifts and your natur\' to wear\r\nclothes, unless they are cut and carried in a red man\'s fashion, but\r\nmake a vartue of necessity and put these on at once, even if they do\r\nrise a little in your throat."\r\n\r\nChingachgook, or the Serpent, eyed the vestments with strong disgust;\r\nbut he saw the usefulness of the disguise, if not its absolute\r\nnecessity. Should the Iroquois discover a red man, in or about the\r\nCastle, it might, indeed, place them more on their guard, and give\r\ntheir suspicions a direction towards their female captive. Any thing was\r\nbetter than a failure, as it regarded his betrothed, and, after turning\r\nthe different garments round and round, examining them with a species\r\nof grave irony, affecting to draw them on in a way that defeated itself,\r\nand otherwise manifesting the reluctance of a young savage to confine\r\nhis limbs in the usual appliances of civilized life, the chief submitted\r\nto the directions of his companion, and finally stood forth, so far\r\nas the eye could detect, a red man in colour alone. Little was to be\r\napprehended from this last peculiarity, however, the distance from the\r\nshore, and the want of glasses preventing any very close scrutiny,\r\nand Deerslayer, himself, though of a brighter and fresher tint, had a\r\ncountenance that was burnt by the sun to a hue scarcely less red than\r\nthat of his Mohican companion. The awkwardness of the Delaware in his\r\nnew attire caused his friend to smile more than once that day, but he\r\ncarefully abstained from the use of any of those jokes which would have\r\nbeen bandied among white men on such an occasion, the habits of a chief,\r\nthe dignity of a warrior on his first path, and the gravity of the\r\ncircumstances in which they were placed uniting to render so much levity\r\nout of season.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at the morning meal of the three islanders, if we may use\r\nthe term, was silent, grave and thoughtful. Judith showed by her looks\r\nthat she had passed an unquiet night, while the two men had the future\r\nbefore them, with its unseen and unknown events. A few words of courtesy\r\npassed between Deerslayer and the girl, in the course of the breakfast,\r\nbut no allusion was made to their situation. At length Judith, whose\r\nheart was full, and whose novel feelings disposed her to entertain\r\nsentiments more gentle and tender than common, introduced the subject,\r\nand this in a way to show how much of her thoughts it had occupied, in\r\nthe course of the last sleepless night.\r\n\r\n"It would be dreadful, Deerslayer," the girl abruptly exclaimed, "should\r\nanything serious befall my father and Hetty! We cannot remain quietly\r\nhere and leave them in the hands of the Iroquois, without bethinking us\r\nof some means of serving them."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready, Judith, to sarve them, and all others who are in trouble,\r\ncould the way to do it be p\'inted out. It\'s no trifling matter to fall\r\ninto red-skin hands, when men set out on an ar\'n\'d like that which took\r\nHutter and Hurry ashore; that I know as well as another, and I wouldn\'t\r\nwish my worst inimy in such a strait, much less them with whom I\'ve\r\njourneyed, and eat, and slept. Have you any scheme, that you would like\r\nto have the Sarpent and me indivour to carry out?"\r\n\r\n"I know of no other means to release the prisoners, than by bribing\r\nthe Iroquois. They are not proof against presents, and we might offer\r\nenough, perhaps, to make them think it better to carry away what to them\r\nwill be rich gifts, than to carry away poor prisoners; if, indeed, they\r\nshould carry them away at all!"\r\n\r\n"This is well enough, Judith; yes, it\'s well enough, if the inimy is\r\nto be bought, and we can find articles to make the purchase with. Your\r\nfather has a convenient lodge, and it is most cunningly placed, though\r\nit doesn\'t seem overstock\'d with riches that will be likely to buy his\r\nransom. There\'s the piece he calls Killdeer, might count for something,\r\nand I understand there\'s a keg of powder about, which might be a\r\nmake-weight, sartain; and yet two able bodied men are not to be bought\r\noff for a trifle--besides--"\r\n\r\n"Besides what?" demanded Judith impatiently, observing that the other\r\nhesitated to proceed, probably from a reluctance to distress her.\r\n\r\n"Why, Judith, the Frenchers offer bounties as well as our own side, and\r\nthe price of two scalps would purchase a keg of powder, and a rifle;\r\nthough I\'ll not say one of the latter altogether as good as Killdeer,\r\nthere, which your father va\'nts as uncommon, and unequalled, like. But\r\nfair powder, and a pretty sartain rifle; then the red men are not the\r\nexpartest in fire arms, and don\'t always know the difference atwixt that\r\nwhich is ra\'al, and that which is seeming."\r\n\r\n"This is horrible!" muttered the girl, struck by the homely manner in\r\nwhich her companion was accustomed to state his facts. "But you overlook\r\nmy own clothes, Deerslayer, and they, I think, might go far with the\r\nwomen of the Iroquois."\r\n\r\n"No doubt they would; no doubt they would, Judith," returned the other,\r\nlooking at her keenly, as if he would ascertain whether she were really\r\ncapable of making such a sacrifice. "But, are you sartain, gal, you\r\ncould find it in your heart to part with your own finery for such a\r\npurpose? Many is the man who has thought he was valiant till danger\r\nstared him in the face; I\'ve known them, too, that consaited they were\r\nkind and ready to give away all they had to the poor, when they\'ve\r\nbeen listening to other people\'s hard heartedness; but whose fists\r\nhave clench\'d as tight as the riven hickory when it came to downright\r\nofferings of their own. Besides, Judith, you\'re handsome--uncommon in\r\nthat way, one might observe and do no harm to the truth--and they that\r\nhave beauty, like to have that which will adorn it. Are you sartain you\r\ncould find it in your heart to part with your own finery?"\r\n\r\nThe soothing allusion to the personal charms of the girl was well timed,\r\nto counteract the effect produced by the distrust that the young man\r\nexpressed of Judith\'s devotion to her filial duties. Had another said\r\nas much as Deerslayer, the compliment would most probably have been\r\noverlooked in the indignation awakened by the doubts, but even the\r\nunpolished sincerity, that so often made this simple minded hunter bare\r\nhis thoughts, had a charm for the girl; and while she colored, and for\r\nan instant her eyes flashed fire, she could not find it in her heart\r\nto be really angry with one whose very soul seemed truth and manly\r\nkindness. Look her reproaches she did, but conquering the desire to\r\nretort, she succeeded in answering in a mild and friendly manner.\r\n\r\n"You must keep all your favorable opinions for the Delaware girls,\r\nDeerslayer, if you seriously think thus of those of your own colour,"\r\nshe said, affecting to laugh. "But try me; if you find that I regret\r\neither ribbon or feather, silk or muslin, then may you think what you\r\nplease of my heart, and say what you think."\r\n\r\n"That\'s justice! The rarest thing to find on \'arth is a truly just man.\r\nSo says Tamenund, the wisest prophet of the Delawares, and so all must\r\nthink that have occasion to see, and talk, and act among Mankind. I love\r\na just man, Sarpent. His eyes are never covered with darkness towards\r\nhis inimies, while they are all sunshine and brightness towards his\r\nfri\'nds. He uses the reason that God has given him, and he uses it with\r\na feelin\' of his being ordered to look at, and to consider things as\r\nthey are, and not as he wants them to be. It\'s easy enough to find men\r\nwho call themselves just, but it\'s wonderful oncommon to find them that\r\nare the very thing, in fact. How often have I seen Indians, gal, who\r\nbelieved they were lookin\' into a matter agreeable to the will of the\r\nGreat Spirit, when in truth they were only striving to act up to their\r\nown will and pleasure, and this, half the time, with a temptation to\r\ngo wrong that could no more be seen by themselves, than the stream that\r\nruns in the next valley can be seen by us through yonder mountain\',\r\nthough any looker on might have discovered it as plainly as we can\r\ndiscover the parch that are swimming around this hut."\r\n\r\n"Very true, Deerslayer," rejoined Judith, losing every trace of\r\ndispleasure in a bright smile--"very true, and I hope to see you act on\r\nthis love of justice in all matters in which I am concerned. Above all,\r\nI hope you will judge for yourself, and not believe every evil story\r\nthat a prating idler like Hurry Harry may have to tell, that goes to\r\ntouch the good name of any young woman, who may not happen to have the\r\nsame opinion of his face and person that the blustering gallant has of\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Hurry Harry\'s idees do not pass for gospel with me, Judith; but even\r\nworse than he may have eyes and ears," returned the other gravely.\r\n\r\n"Enough of this!" exclaimed Judith, with flashing eye and a flush that\r\nmounted to her temples, "and more of my father and his ransom. \'Tis as\r\nyou say, Deerslayer; the Indians will not be likely to give up their\r\nprisoners without a heavier bribe than my clothes can offer, and\r\nfather\'s rifle and powder. There is the chest."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there is the chest as you say, Judith, and when the question gets\r\nto be between a secret and a scalp, I should think most men would prefer\r\nkeeping the last. Did your father ever give you any downright commands\r\nconsarning that chist?"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Never. He has always appeared to think its locks, and its steel bands,\r\nand its strength, its best protection."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a rare chest, and altogether of curious build," returned\r\nDeerslayer, rising and approaching the thing in question, on which\r\nhe seated himself, with a view to examine it with greater ease.\r\n"Chingachgook, this is no wood that comes of any forest that you or I\r\nhave ever trailed through! \'Tisn\'t the black walnut, and yet it\'s quite\r\nas comely, if not more so, did the smoke and the treatment give it fair\r\nplay."\r\n\r\nThe Delaware drew near, felt of the wood, examined its grain, endeavored\r\nto indent the surface with a nail, and passed his hand curiously over\r\nthe steel bands, the heavy padlocks, and the other novel peculiarities\r\nof the massive box.\r\n\r\n"No--nothing like this grows in these regions," resumed Deerslayer.\r\n"I\'ve seen all the oaks, both the maples, the elms, the bass woods, all\r\nthe walnuts, the butternuts, and every tree that has a substance and\r\ncolour, wrought into some form or other, but never have I before seen\r\nsuch a wood as this! Judith, the chest itself would buy your father\'s\r\nfreedom, or Iroquois cur\'osity isn\'t as strong as red-skin cur\'osity, in\r\ngeneral; especially in the matter of woods."\r\n\r\n"The purchase might be cheaper made, perhaps, Deerslayer. The chest is\r\nfull, and it would be better to part with half than to part with the\r\nwhole. Besides, father--I know not why--but father values that chest\r\nhighly."\r\n\r\n"He would seem to prize what it holds more than the chest, itself,\r\njudging by the manner in which he treats the outside, and secures the\r\ninside. Here are three locks, Judith; is there no key?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen one, and yet key there must be, since Hetty told us she\r\nhad often seen the chest opened."\r\n\r\n"Keys no more lie in the air, or float on the water, than humans, gal;\r\nif there is a key, there must be a place in which it is kept."\r\n\r\n"That is true, and it might not be difficult to find it, did we dare to\r\nsearch!"\r\n\r\n"This is for you, Judith; it is altogether for you. The chist is your\'n,\r\nor your father\'s; and Hutter is your father, not mine. Cur\'osity is a\r\nwoman\'s, and not a man\'s failing, and there you have got all the reasons\r\nbefore you. If the chist has articles for ransom, it seems to me they\r\nwould be wisely used in redeeming their owner\'s life, or even in saving\r\nhis scalp; but that is a matter for your judgment, and not for ourn.\r\nWhen the lawful owner of a trap, or a buck, or a canoe, isn\'t present,\r\nhis next of kin becomes his riprisentyve by all the laws of the woods.\r\nWe therefore leave you to say whether the chist shall, or shall not be\r\nopened."\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not believe I can hesitate, when my father\'s life\'s in\r\ndanger, Deerslayer!"\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s pretty much putting a scolding ag\'in tears and mourning.\r\nIt\'s not onreasonable to foretell that old Tom may find fault with\r\nwhat you\'ve done, when he sees himself once more in his hut, here, but\r\nthere\'s nothing unusual in men\'s falling out with what has been done for\r\ntheir own good; I dare to say that even the moon would seem a different\r\nthing from what it now does, could we look at it from the other side."\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer, if we can find the key, I will authorize you to open\r\nthe chest, and to take such things from it as you may think will buy\r\nfather\'s ransom."\r\n\r\n"First find the key, gal; we\'ll talk of the rest a\'terwards. Sarpent,\r\nyou\'ve eyes like a fly, and a judgment that\'s seldom out. Can you help\r\nus in calculating where Floating Tom would be apt to keep the key of a\r\nchist that he holds to be as private as this?"\r\n\r\nThe Delaware had taken no part in the discourse until he was thus\r\ndirectly appealed to, when he quitted the chest, which had continued to\r\nattract his attention, and cast about him for the place in which a key\r\nwould be likely to be concealed under such circumstances. As Judith and\r\nDeerslayer were not idle the while, the whole three were soon engaged in\r\nan anxious and spirited search. As it was certain that the desired key\r\nwas not to be found in any of the common drawers or closets, of which\r\nthere were several in the building, none looked there, but all turned\r\ntheir inquiries to those places that struck them as ingenious hiding\r\nplaces, and more likely to be used for such a purpose. In this manner\r\nthe outer room was thoroughly but fruitlessly examined, when they\r\nentered the sleeping apartment of Hutter. This part of the rude building\r\nwas better furnished than the rest of the structure, containing several\r\narticles that had been especially devoted to the service of the deceased\r\nwife of its owner, but as Judith had all the rest of the keys, it was\r\nsoon rummaged without bringing to light the particular key desired.\r\n\r\nThey now entered the bed room of the daughters. Chingachgook was\r\nimmediately struck with the contrast between the articles and the\r\narrangement of that side of the room that might be called Judith\'s, and\r\nthat which more properly belonged to Hetty. A slight exclamation escaped\r\nhim, and pointing in each direction he alluded to the fact in a low\r\nvoice, speaking to his friend in the Delaware tongue.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis as you think, Sarpent," answered Deerslayer, whose remarks we\r\nalways translate into English, preserving as much as possible of the\r\npeculiar phraseology and manner of the man, "\'Tis just so, as any one\r\nmay see, and \'tis all founded in natur\'. One sister loves finery, some\r\nsay overmuch; while t\'other is as meek and lowly as God ever created\r\ngoodness and truth. Yet, after all, I dare say that Judith has her\r\nvartues, and Hetty has her failin\'s."\r\n\r\n"And the \'Feeble-Mind\' has seen the chist opened?" inquired\r\nChingachgook, with curiosity in his glance.\r\n\r\n"Sartain; that much I\'ve heard from her own lips; and, for that matter,\r\nso have you. It seems her father doesn\'t misgive her discretion, though\r\nhe does that of his eldest darter."\r\n\r\n"Then the key is hid only from the Wild Rose?" for so Chingachgook\r\nhad begun gallantly to term Judith, in his private discourse with his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it! That\'s just it! One he trusts, and the other he doesn\'t.\r\nThere\'s red and white in that, Sarpent, all tribes and nations agreeing\r\nin trusting some, and refusing to trust other some. It depends on\r\ncharacter and judgment."\r\n\r\n"Where could a key be put, so little likely to be found by the Wild\r\nRose, as among coarse clothes?"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer started, and turning to his friend with admiration expressed\r\nin every lineament of his face, he fairly laughed, in his silent but\r\nhearty manner, at the ingenuity and readiness of the conjecture.\r\n\r\n"Your name\'s well bestowed, Sarpent--yes, \'tis well bestowed! Sure\r\nenough, where would a lover of finery be so little likely to s\'arch, as\r\namong garments as coarse and onseemly as these of poor Hetty\'s. I dares\r\nto say, Judith\'s delicate fingers haven\'t touched a bit of cloth\r\nas rough and oncomely as that petticoat, now, since she first made\r\nacquaintance with the officers! Yet, who knows? The key may be as likely\r\nto be on the same peg, as in any other place. Take down the garment,\r\nDelaware, and let us see if you are ra\'ally a prophet." Chingachgook\r\ndid as desired, but no key was found. A coarse pocket, apparently empty,\r\nhung on the adjoining peg, and this was next examined. By this time,\r\nthe attention of Judith was called in that direction, and she spoke\r\nhurriedly and like one who wished to save unnecessary trouble.\r\n\r\n"Those are only the clothes of poor Hetty, dear simple girl!" she said,\r\n"Nothing we seek would be likely to be there."\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of the handsome mouth of the speaker, when\r\nChingachgook drew the desired key from the pocket. Judith was too quick\r\nof apprehension not to understand the reason a hiding place so simple\r\nand exposed had been used. The blood rushed to her face, as much with\r\nresentment, perhaps, as with shame, and she bit her lip, though she\r\ncontinued silent. Deerslayer and his friend now discovered the delicacy\r\nof men of native refinement, neither smiling or even by a glance\r\nbetraying how completely he understood the motives and ingenuity of this\r\nclever artifice. The former, who had taken the key from the Indian, led\r\nthe way into the adjoining room, and applying it to a lock ascertained\r\nthat the right instrument had actually been found. There were three\r\npadlocks, each of which however was easily opened by this single key.\r\nDeerslayer removed them all, loosened the hasps, raised the lid a little\r\nto make certain it was loose, and then he drew back from the chest\r\nseveral feet, signing to his friend to follow.\r\n\r\n"This is a family chist, Judith," he said, "and \'tis like to hold family\r\nsecrets. The Sarpent and I will go into the Ark, and look to the canoes,\r\nand paddles, and oars, while you can examine it by yourself, and find\r\nout whether any thing that will be a make-weight in a ransom is, or is\r\nnot, among the articles. When you\'ve got through give us a call, and\r\nwe\'ll all sit in council together touching the valie of the articles."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Deerslayer," exclaimed the girl, as he was about to withdraw.\r\n"Not a single thing will I touch--I will not even raise the lid--unless\r\nyou are present. Father and Hetty have seen fit to keep the inside of\r\nthis chest a secret from me, and I am much too proud to pry into their\r\nhidden treasures unless it were for their own good. But on no account\r\nwill I open the chest alone. Stay with me, then; I want witnesses of\r\nwhat I do."\r\n\r\n"I rather think, Sarpent, that the gal is right! Confidence and reliance\r\nbeget security, but suspicion is like to make us all wary. Judith has a\r\nright to ask us to be present, and should the chist hold any of Master\r\nHutter\'s secrets, they will fall into the keeping of two as close\r\nmouthed young men as are to be found. We will stay with you, Judith--but\r\nfirst let us take a look at the lake and the shore, for this chist will\r\nnot be emptied in a minute."\r\n\r\nThe two men now went out on the platform, and Deerslayer swept the shore\r\nwith the glass, while the Indian gravely turned his eye on the water and\r\nthe woods, in quest of any sign that might betray the machinations\r\nof their enemies. Nothing was visible, and assured of their temporary\r\nsecurity, the three collected around the chest again, with the avowed\r\nobject of opening it.\r\n\r\nJudith had held this chest and its unknown contents in a species of\r\nreverence as long as she could remember. Neither her father nor her\r\nmother ever mentioned it in her presence, and there appeared to be a\r\nsilent convention that in naming the different objects that occasionally\r\nstood near it, or even lay on its lid, care should be had to avoid any\r\nallusion to the chest itself. Habit had rendered this so easy, and so\r\nmuch a matter of course, that it was only quite recently the girl had\r\nbegan even to muse on the singularity of the circumstance. But there had\r\nnever been sufficient intimacy between Hutter and his eldest daughter to\r\ninvite confidence. At times he was kind, but in general, with her more\r\nespecially, he was stern and morose. Least of all had his authority been\r\nexercised in a way to embolden his child to venture on the liberty she\r\nwas about to take, without many misgivings of the consequences, although\r\nthe liberty proceeded from a desire to serve himself. Then Judith was\r\nnot altogether free from a little superstition on the subject of this\r\nchest, which had stood a sort of tabooed relic before her eyes from\r\nchildhood to the present hour. Nevertheless the time had come when\r\nit would seem that this mystery was to be explained, and that under\r\ncircumstances, too, which left her very little choice in the matter.\r\n\r\nFinding that both her companions were watching her movements, in grave\r\nsilence, Judith placed a hand on the lid and endeavored to raise it. Her\r\nstrength, however, was insufficient, and it appeared to the girl, who\r\nwas fully aware that all the fastenings were removed, that she was\r\nresisted in an unhallowed attempt by some supernatural power.\r\n\r\n"I cannot raise the lid, Deerslayer!" she said--"Had we not better give\r\nup the attempt, and find some other means of releasing the prisoners?"\r\n\r\n"Not so--Judith; not so, gal. No means are as sartain and easy, as a\r\ngood bribe," answered the other. "As for the lid, \'tis held by nothing\r\nbut its own weight, which is prodigious for so small a piece of wood,\r\nloaded with iron as it is."\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer spoke, he applied his own strength to the effort, and\r\nsucceeded in raising the lid against the timbers of the house, where he\r\ntook care to secure it by a sufficient prop. Judith fairly trembled\r\nas she cast her first glance at the interior, and she felt a temporary\r\nrelief in discovering that a piece of canvas, that was carefully tucked\r\nin around the edges, effectually concealed all beneath it. The chest was\r\napparently well stored, however, the canvas lying within an inch of the\r\nlid.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a full cargo," said Deerslayer, eyeing the arrangement, "and\r\nwe had needs go to work leisurely and at our ease. Sarpent, bring some\r\nstools while I spread this blanket on the floor, and then we\'ll begin\r\nwork orderly and in comfort."\r\n\r\nThe Delaware complied, Deerslayer civilly placed a stool for Judith,\r\ntook one himself, and commenced the removal of the canvas covering.\r\nThis was done deliberately, and in as cautious a manner as if it were\r\nbelieved that fabrics of a delicate construction lay hidden beneath.\r\nWhen the canvass was removed, the first articles that came in view were\r\nsome of the habiliments of the male sex. They were of fine materials,\r\nand, according to the fashions of the age, were gay in colours and rich\r\nin ornaments. One coat in particular was of scarlet, and had button\r\nholes worked in gold thread. Still it was not military, but was part of\r\nthe attire of a civilian of condition, at a period when social rank\r\nwas rigidly respected in dress. Chingachgook could not refrain from an\r\nexclamation of pleasure, as soon as Deerslayer opened this coat and held\r\nit up to view, for, notwithstanding all his trained self-command, the\r\nsplendor of the vestment was too much for the philosophy of an Indian.\r\nDeerslayer turned quickly, and he regarded his friend with momentary\r\ndispleasure as this burst of weakness escaped him, and then he\r\nsoliloquized, as was his practice whenever any strong feeling suddenly\r\ngot the ascendancy.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis his gift!--yes, \'tis the gift of a red-skin to love finery, and\r\nhe is not to be blamed. This is an extr\'ornary garment, too, and\r\nextr\'ornary things get up extr\'ornary feelin\'s. I think this will do,\r\nJudith, for the Indian heart is hardly to be found in all America that\r\ncan withstand colours like these, and glitter like that. If this coat\r\nwas ever made for your father, you\'ve come honestly by the taste for\r\nfinery, you have."\r\n\r\n"That coat was never made for father," answered the girl, quickly--"it\r\nis much too long, while father is short and square."\r\n\r\n"Cloth was plenty if it was, and glitter cheap," answered Deerslayer,\r\nwith his silent, joyous laugh. "Sarpent, this garment was made for a man\r\nof your size, and I should like to see it on your shoulders."\r\n\r\nChingachgook, nothing loath, submitted to the trial, throwing aside the\r\ncoarse and thread bare jacket of Hutter, to deck his person in a coat\r\nthat was originally intended for a gentleman. The transformation was\r\nludicrous, but as men are seldom struck with incongruities in their own\r\nappearance, any more than in their own conduct, the Delaware studied\r\nthis change in a common glass, by which Hutter was in the habit of\r\nshaving, with grave interest. At that moment he thought of Hist, and\r\nwe owe it to truth, to say, though it may militate a little against the\r\nstern character of a warrior to avow it, that he wished he could be seen\r\nby her in his present improved aspect.\r\n\r\n"Off with it, Sarpent--off with it," resumed the inflexible Deerslayer.\r\n"Such garments as little become you as they would become me. Your gifts\r\nare for paint, and hawk\'s feathers, and blankets, and wampum, and mine\r\nare for doublets of skins, tough leggings, and sarviceable moccasins.\r\nI say moccasins, Judith, for though white, living as I do in the woods\r\nit\'s necessary to take to some of the practyces of the woods, for\r\ncomfort\'s sake and cheapness."\r\n\r\n"I see no reason, Deerslayer, why one man may not wear a scarlet coat,\r\nas well as another," returned the girl. "I wish I could see you in this\r\nhandsome garment."\r\n\r\n"See me in a coat fit for a Lord!--Well, Judith, if you wait till that\r\nday, you\'ll wait until you see me beyond reason and memory. No--no--gal,\r\nmy gifts are my gifts, and I\'ll live and die in \'em, though I never\r\nbring down another deer, or spear another salmon. What have I done that\r\nyou should wish to see me in such a flaunting coat, Judith?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think, Deerslayer, that the false-tongued and false-hearted\r\nyoung gallants of the garrisons, ought not alone to appear in fine\r\nfeathers, but that truth and honesty have their claims to be honored and\r\nexalted."\r\n\r\n"And what exaltification"--the reader will have remarked that Deerslayer\r\nhad not very critically studied his dictionary--"and what exaltification\r\nwould it be to me, Judith, to be bedizened and bescarleted like a Mingo\r\nchief that has just got his presents up from Quebec? No--no--I\'m well as\r\nI am; and if not, I can be no better. Lay the coat down on the blanket,\r\nSarpent, and let us look farther into the chist."\r\n\r\nThe tempting garment, one surely that was never intended for Hutter, was\r\nlaid aside, and the examination proceeded. The male attire, all of which\r\ncorresponded with the coat in quality, was soon exhausted, and then\r\nsucceeded female. A beautiful dress of brocade, a little the worse\r\nfrom negligent treatment, followed, and this time open exclamations of\r\ndelight escaped the lips of Judith. Much as the girl had been addicted\r\nto dress, and favorable as had been her opportunities of seeing\r\nsome little pretension in that way among the wives of the different\r\ncommandants, and other ladies of the forts, never before had she beheld\r\na tissue, or tints, to equal those that were now so unexpectedly placed\r\nbefore her eyes. Her rapture was almost childish, nor would she allow\r\nthe inquiry to proceed, until she had attired her person in a robe so\r\nunsuited to her habits and her abode. With this end, she withdrew into\r\nher own room, where with hands practised in such offices, she soon got\r\nrid of her own neat gown of linen, and stood forth in the gay tints of\r\nthe brocade. The dress happened to fit the fine, full person of Judith,\r\nand certainly it had never adorned a being better qualified by natural\r\ngifts to do credit to its really rich hues and fine texture. When she\r\nreturned, both Deerslayer and Chingachgook, who had passed the brief\r\ntime of her absence in taking a second look at the male garments, arose\r\nin surprise, each permitting exclamations of wonder and pleasure to\r\nescape him, in a way so unequivocal as to add new lustre to the eyes\r\nof Judith, by flushing her cheeks with a glow of triumph. Affecting,\r\nhowever, not to notice the impression she had made, the girl seated\r\nherself with the stateliness of a queen, desiring that the chest might\r\nbe looked into, further.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know a better way to treat with the Mingos, gal," cried\r\nDeerslayer, "than to send you ashore as you be, and to tell \'em that a\r\nqueen has arrived among \'em! They\'ll give up old Hutter, and Hurry, and\r\nHetty, too, at such a spectacle!"\r\n\r\n"I thought your tongue too honest to flatter, Deerslayer," returned the\r\ngirl, gratified at this admiration more than she would have cared to\r\nown. "One of the chief reasons of my respect for you, was your love for\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"And \'tis truth, and solemn truth, Judith, and nothing else. Never did\r\neyes of mine gaze on as glorious a lookin\' creatur\' as you be yourself,\r\nat this very moment! I\'ve seen beauties in my time, too, both white and\r\nred; and them that was renowned and talk\'d of, far and near; but never\r\nhave I beheld one that could hold any comparison with what you are at\r\nthis blessed instant, Judith; never."\r\n\r\nThe glance of delight which the girl bestowed on the frank-speaking\r\nhunter in no degree lessened the effect of her charms, and as the\r\nhumid eyes blended with it a look of sensibility, perhaps Judith never\r\nappeared more truly lovely, than at what the young man had called that\r\n"blessed instant." He shook his head, held it suspended a moment\r\nover the open chest, like one in doubt, and then proceeded with the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the minor articles of female dress came next, all of a\r\nquality to correspond with the gown. These were laid at Judith\'s feet,\r\nin silence, as if she had a natural claim to their possession. One or\r\ntwo, such as gloves, and lace, the girl caught up, and appended to her\r\nalready rich attire in affected playfulness, but with the real design\r\nof decorating her person as far as circumstances would allow. When\r\nthese two remarkable suits, male and female they might be termed, were\r\nremoved, another canvas covering separated the remainder of the\r\narticles from the part of the chest which they had occupied. As soon\r\nas Deerslayer perceived this arrangement he paused, doubtful of the\r\npropriety of proceeding any further.\r\n\r\n"Every man has his secrets, I suppose," he said, "and all men have\r\na right to their enj\'yment. We\'ve got low enough in this chist in my\r\njudgment to answer our wants, and it seems to me we should do well by\r\ngoing no farther; and by letting Master Hutter have to himself, and his\r\nown feelin\'s, all that\'s beneath this cover.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean, Deerslayer, to offer these clothes to the Iroquois as\r\nransom?" demanded Judith, quickly.\r\n\r\n"Sartain. What are we prying into another man\'s chist for, but to sarve\r\nits owner in the best way we can. This coat, alone, would be very apt\r\nto gain over the head chief of the riptyles, and if his wife or darter\r\nshould happen to be out with him, that there gownd would soften the\r\nheart of any woman that is to be found atween Albany and Montreal. I do\r\nnot see that we want a larger stock in trade than them two articles."\r\n\r\n"To you it may seem so, Deerslayer," returned the disappointed girl,\r\n"but of what use could a dress like this be to any Indian woman? She\r\ncould not wear it among the branches of the trees, the dirt and smoke of\r\nthe wigwam would soon soil it, and how would a pair of red arms appear,\r\nthrust through these short, laced sleeves!"\r\n\r\n"All very true, gal, and you might go on and say it is altogether out of\r\ntime, and place and season, in this region at all. What is it to us how\r\nthe finery is treated, so long as it answers our wishes? I do not see\r\nthat your father can make any use of such clothes, and it\'s lucky he has\r\nthings that are of no valie to himself, that will bear a high price with\r\nothers. We can make no better trade for him, than to offer these duds\r\nfor his liberty. We\'ll throw in the light frivol\'ties, and get Hurry off\r\nin the bargain."\r\n\r\n"Then you think, Deerslayer, that Thomas Hutter has no one in his\r\nfamily--no child--no daughter, to whom this dress may be thought\r\nbecoming, and whom you could wish to see in it, once and awhile, even\r\nthough it should be at long intervals, and only in playfulness?"\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Judith--yes, I now understand your meaning, and I\r\nthink I can say, your wishes. That you are as glorious in that dress as\r\nthe sun when it rises or sets in a soft October day, I\'m ready to allow,\r\nand that you greatly become it is a good deal more sartain than that it\r\nbecomes you. There\'s gifts in clothes, as well as in other things. Now\r\nI do not think that a warrior on his first path ought to lay on the same\r\nawful paints as a chief that has had his virtue tried, and knows from\r\nexper\'ence he will not disgrace his pretensions. So it is with all of\r\nus, red or white. You are Thomas Hutter\'s darter, and that gownd was\r\nmade for the child of some governor, or a lady of high station, and it\r\nwas intended to be worn among fine furniture, and in rich company. In\r\nmy eyes, Judith, a modest maiden never looks more becoming than when\r\nbecomingly clad, and nothing is suitable that is out of character.\r\nBesides, gal, if there\'s a creatur\' in the colony that can afford to\r\ndo without finery, and to trust to her own good looks and sweet\r\ncountenance, it\'s yourself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take off the rubbish this instant, Deerslayer," cried the girl,\r\nspringing up to leave the room, "and never do I wish to see it on any\r\nhuman being, again."\r\n\r\n"So it is with \'em, all, Sarpent," said the other, turning to his friend\r\nand laughing, as soon as the beauty had disappeared. "They like finery,\r\nbut they like their natyve charms most of all. I\'m glad the gal has\r\nconsented to lay aside her furbelows, howsever, for it\'s ag\'in reason\r\nfor one of her class to wear em; and then she is handsome enough, as I\r\ncall it, to go alone. Hist would show oncommon likely, too, in such a\r\ngownd, Delaware!"\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah is a red-skin girl, Deerslayer," returned the Indian, "like\r\nthe young of the pigeon, she is to be known by her own feathers. I\r\nshould pass by without knowing her, were she dressed in such a skin.\r\nIt\'s wisest always to be so clad that our friends need not ask us for\r\nour names. The \'Wild Rose\' is very pleasant, but she is no sweeter for\r\nso many colours."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!--that\'s natur\', and the true foundation for love and\r\nprotection. When a man stoops to pick a wild strawberry, he does not\r\nexpect to find a melon; and when he wishes to gather a melon, he\'s\r\ndisapp\'inted if it proves to be a squash; though squashes be often\r\nbrighter to the eye than melons. That\'s it, and it means stick to your\r\ngifts, and your gifts will stick to you."\r\n\r\nThe two men had now a little discussion together, touching the propriety\r\nof penetrating any farther into the chest of Hutter, when Judith\r\nre-appeared, divested of her robes, and in her own simple linen frock\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Judith," said Deerslayer, taking her kindly by the hand--"for\r\nI know it went a little ag\'in the nat\'ral cravings of woman, to lay\r\naside so much finery, as it might be in a lump. But you\'re more pleasing\r\nto the eye as you stand, you be, than if you had a crown on your head,\r\nand jewels dangling from your hair. The question now is, whether to lift\r\nthis covering to see what will be ra\'ally the best bargain we can make\r\nfor Master Hutter, for we must do as we think he would be willing to do,\r\ndid he stand here in our places."\r\n\r\nJudith looked very happy. Accustomed as she was to adulation, the homely\r\nhomage of Deerslayer had given her more true satisfaction, than she had\r\never yet received from the tongue of man. It was not the terms in which\r\nthis admiration had been expressed, for they were simple enough, that\r\nproduced so strong an impression; nor yet their novelty, or their warmth\r\nof manner, nor any of those peculiarities that usually give value to\r\npraise; but the unflinching truth of the speaker, that carried his\r\nwords so directly to the heart of the listener. This is one of the\r\ngreat advantages of plain dealing and frankness. The habitual and wily\r\nflatterer may succeed until his practices recoil on himself, and like\r\nother sweets his aliment cloys by its excess; but he who deals honestly,\r\nthough he often necessarily offends, possesses a power of praising that\r\nno quality but sincerity can bestow, since his words go directly to\r\nthe heart, finding their support in the understanding. Thus it was with\r\nDeerslayer and Judith. So soon and so deeply did this simple hunter\r\nimpress those who knew him with a conviction of his unbending honesty,\r\nthat all he uttered in commendation was as certain to please, as all he\r\nuttered in the way of rebuke was as certain to rankle and excite enmity,\r\nwhere his character had not awakened a respect and affection, that in\r\nanother sense rendered it painful. In after life, when the career of\r\nthis untutored being brought him in contact with officers of rank, and\r\nothers entrusted with the care of the interests of the state, this same\r\ninfluence was exerted on a wider field, even generals listening to his\r\ncommendations with a glow of pleasure, that it was not always in the\r\npower of their official superiors to awaken. Perhaps Judith was the\r\nfirst individual of his own colour who fairly submitted to this natural\r\nconsequence of truth and fair-dealing on the part of Deerslayer. She had\r\nactually pined for his praise, and she had now received it, and that\r\nin the form which was most agreeable to her weaknesses and habits of\r\nthought. The result will appear in the course of the narrative.\r\n\r\n"If we knew all that chest holds, Deerslayer," returned the girl, when\r\nshe had a little recovered from the immediate effect produced by his\r\ncommendations of her personal appearance, "we could better determine on\r\nthe course we ought to take."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not onreasonable, gal, though it\'s more a pale-face than a\r\nred-skin gift to be prying into other people\'s secrets."\r\n\r\n"Curiosity is natural, and it is expected that all human beings should\r\nhave human failings. Whenever I\'ve been at the garrisons, I\'ve found\r\nthat most in and about them had a longing to learn their neighbor\'s\r\nsecrets."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and sometimes to fancy them, when they couldn\'t find \'em out!\r\nThat\'s the difference atween an Indian gentleman and a white gentleman.\r\nThe Sarpent, here, would turn his head aside if he found himself\r\nonknowingly lookin\' into another chief\'s wigwam, whereas in the\r\nsettlements while all pretend to be great people, most prove they\'ve\r\ngot betters, by the manner in which they talk of their consarns. I\'ll be\r\nbound, Judith, you wouldn\'t get the Sarpent, there, to confess there\r\nwas another in the tribe so much greater than himself, as to become the\r\nsubject of his idees, and to empl\'y his tongue in conversations about\r\nhis movements, and ways, and food, and all the other little matters that\r\noccupy a man when he\'s not empl\'y\'d in his greater duties. He who does\r\nthis is but little better than a blackguard, in the grain, and them that\r\nencourages him is pretty much of the same kidney, let them wear coats as\r\nfine as they may, or of what dye they please."\r\n\r\n"But this is not another man\'s wigwam; it belongs to my father, these\r\nare his things, and they are wanted in his service."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, gal; that\'s true, and it carries weight with it. Well,\r\nwhen all is before us we may, indeed, best judge which to offer for the\r\nransom, and which to withhold."\r\n\r\nJudith was not altogether as disinterested in her feelings as she\r\naffected to be. She remembered that the curiosity of Hetty had\r\nbeen indulged in connection with this chest, while her own had been\r\ndisregarded, and she was not sorry to possess an opportunity of being\r\nplaced on a level with her less gifted sister in this one particular. It\r\nappearing to be admitted all round that the enquiry into the contents of\r\nthe chest ought to be renewed, Deerslayer proceeded to remove the second\r\ncovering of canvass.\r\n\r\nThe articles that lay uppermost, when the curtain was again raised on\r\nthe secrets of the chest, were a pair of pistols, curiously inlaid with\r\nsilver. Their value would have been considerable in one of the towns,\r\nthough as weapons in the woods they were a species of arms seldom\r\nemployed; never, indeed, unless it might be by some officer from\r\nEurope, who visited the colonies, as many were then wont to do, so much\r\nimpressed with the superiority of the usages of London as to fancy they\r\nwere not to be laid aside on the frontiers of America. What occurred on\r\nthe discovery of these weapons will appear in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "An oaken, broken, elbow-chair;\r\n    A caudle-cup without an ear;\r\n    A battered, shattered ash bedstead;\r\n    A box of deal without a lid;\r\n    A pair of tongs, but out of joint;\r\n    A back-sword poker, without point;\r\n    A dish which might good meat afford once;\r\n    An Ovid, and an old\r\n    Concordance."\r\n\r\n    Thomas Sheridan, "A True and Faithful Inventory of the Goods\r\n    belonging to Dr. Swift," II. i-6, 13-14.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Deerslayer raise the pistols, than he turned to the\r\nDelaware and held them up for his admiration.\r\n\r\n"Child gun," said the Serpent, smiling, while he handled one of the\r\ninstruments as if it had been a toy.\r\n\r\n"Not it, Sarpent; not it--\'twas made for a man and would satisfy a\r\ngiant, if rightly used. But stop; white men are remarkable for their\r\ncarelessness in putting away fire arms, in chists and corners. Let me\r\nlook if care has been given to these."\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer spoke, he took the weapon from the hand of his friend and\r\nopened the pan. The last was filled with priming, caked like a bit of\r\ncinder, by time, moisture and compression. An application of the ramrod\r\nshowed that both the pistols were charged, although Judith could testify\r\nthat they had probably lain for years in the chest. It is not easy to\r\nportray the surprise of the Indian at this discovery, for he was in the\r\npractice of renewing his priming daily, and of looking to the contents\r\nof his piece at other short intervals.\r\n\r\n"This is white neglect," said Deerslayer, shaking his head, "and scarce\r\na season goes by that some one in the settlements doesn\'t suffer from\r\nit. It\'s extr\'ornary too, Judith--yes, it\'s downright extr\'ornary that\r\nthe owner shall fire his piece at a deer, or some other game, or perhaps\r\nat an inimy, and twice out of three times he\'ll miss; but let him catch\r\nan accident with one of these forgotten charges, and he makes it sartain\r\ndeath to a child, or a brother, or a fri\'nd! Well, we shall do a good\r\nturn to the owner if we fire these pistols for him, and as they\'re\r\nnovelties to you and me, Sarpent, we\'ll try our hands at a mark. Freshen\r\nthat priming, and I\'ll do the same with this, and then we\'ll see who is\r\nthe best man with a pistol; as for the rifle, that\'s long been settled\r\natween us."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer laughed heartily at his own conceit, and, in a minute or two,\r\nthey were both standing on the platform, selecting some object in the\r\nArk for their target. Judith was led by curiosity to their side.\r\n\r\n"Stand back, gal, stand a little back; these we\'pons have been\r\nlong loaded," said Deerslayer, "and some accident may happen in the\r\ndischarge." "Then you shall not fire them! Give them both to the\r\nDelaware; or it would be better to unload them without firing."\r\n\r\n"That\'s ag\'in usage--and some people say, ag\'in manhood; though I hold\r\nto no such silly doctrine. We must fire \'em, Judith; yes, we must fire\r\n\'em; though I foresee that neither will have any great reason to boast\r\nof his skill."\r\n\r\nJudith, in the main, was a girl of great personal spirit, and her habits\r\nprevented her from feeling any of the terror that is apt to come over\r\nher sex at the report of fire arms. She had discharged many a rifle,\r\nand had even been known to kill a deer, under circumstances that were\r\nfavorable to the effort. She submitted therefore, falling a little back\r\nby the side of Deerslayer, giving the Indian the front of the platform\r\nto himself. Chingachgook raised the weapon several times, endeavored to\r\nsteady it by using both hands, changed his attitude from one that was\r\nawkward to another still more so, and finally drew the trigger with a\r\nsort of desperate indifference, without having, in reality, secured any\r\naim at all. The consequence was, that instead of hitting the knot which\r\nhad been selected for the mark, he missed the ark altogether; the bullet\r\nskipping along the water like a stone that was thrown by hand.\r\n\r\n"Well done--Sarpent--well done--" cried Deerslayer laughing, with his\r\nnoiseless glee, "you\'ve hit the lake, and that\'s an expl\'ite for some\r\nmen! I know\'d it, and as much as said it, here, to Judith; for your\r\nshort we\'pons don\'t belong to red-skin gifts. You\'ve hit the lake, and\r\nthat\'s better than only hitting the air! Now, stand back and let us see\r\nwhat white gifts can do with a white we\'pon. A pistol isn\'t a rifle, but\r\ncolour is colour."\r\n\r\nThe aim of Deerslayer was both quick and steady, and the report followed\r\nalmost as soon as the weapon rose. Still the pistol hung fire, as it is\r\ntermed, and fragments of it flew in a dozen directions, some falling on\r\nthe roof of the castle, others in the Ark, and one in the water. Judith\r\nscreamed, and when the two men turned anxiously towards the girl she was\r\nas pale as death, trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\n"She\'s wounded--yes, the poor gal\'s wounded, Sarpent, though one\r\ncouldn\'t foresee it, standing where she did. We\'ll lead her in to a\r\nseat, and we must do the best for her that our knowledge and skill can\r\nafford."\r\n\r\nJudith allowed herself to be supported to a seat, swallowed a mouthful\r\nof the water that the Delaware offered her in a gourd, and, after a\r\nviolent fit of trembling that seemed ready to shake her fine frame to\r\ndissolution, she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"The pain must be borne, poor Judith--yes, it must be borne," said\r\nDeerslayer, soothingly, "though I am far from wishing you not to weep;\r\nfor weeping often lightens galish feelin\'s. Where can she be hurt,\r\nSarpent? I see no signs of blood, nor any rent of skin or garments?"\r\n\r\n"I am uninjured, Deerslayer," stammered the girl through her tears.\r\n"It\'s fright--nothing more, I do assure you, and, God be praised! no\r\none, I find, has been harmed by the accident."\r\n\r\n"This is extr\'ornary!" exclaimed the unsuspecting and simple minded\r\nhunter--"I thought, Judith, you\'d been above settlement weaknesses,\r\nand that you was a gal not to be frightened by the sound of a bursting\r\nwe\'pon--No--I didn\'t think you so skeary! Hetty might well have been\r\nstartled; but you\'ve too much judgment and reason to be frightened\r\nwhen the danger\'s all over. They\'re pleasant to the eye, chief, and\r\nchangeful, but very unsartain in their feelin\'s!"\r\n\r\nShame kept Judith silent. There had been no acting in her agitation, but\r\nall had fairly proceeded from sudden and uncontrollable alarm--an alarm\r\nthat she found almost as inexplicable to herself, as it proved to be\r\nto her companions. Wiping away the traces of tears, however, she smiled\r\nagain, and was soon able to join in the laugh at her own folly.\r\n\r\n"And you, Deerslayer," she at length succeeded in saying--"are you,\r\nindeed, altogether unhurt? It seems almost miraculous that a pistol\r\nshould have burst in your hand, and you escape without the loss of a\r\nlimb, if not of life!"\r\n\r\n"Such wonders ar\'n\'t oncommon, at all, among worn out arms. The first\r\nrifle they gave me play\'d the same trick, and yet I liv\'d through it,\r\nthough not as onharmless as I\'ve got out of this affair. Thomas Hutter\r\nis master of one pistol less than he was this morning, but, as it\r\nhappened in trying to sarve him, there\'s no ground of complaint. Now,\r\ndraw near, and let us look farther into the inside of the chist."\r\n\r\nJudith, by this time, had so far gotten the better of her agitation as\r\nto resume her seat, and the examination went on. The next article that\r\noffered was enveloped in cloth, and on opening it, it proved to be one\r\nof the mathematical instruments that were then in use among seamen,\r\npossessing the usual ornaments and fastenings in brass. Deerslayer and\r\nChingachgook expressed their admiration and surprise at the appearance\r\nof the unknown instrument, which was bright and glittering, having\r\napparently been well cared for.\r\n\r\n"This goes beyond the surveyors, Judith!" Deerslayer exclaimed, after\r\nturning the instrument several times in his hands. "I\'ve seen all their\r\ntools often, and wicked and heartless enough are they, for they never\r\ncome into the forest but to lead the way to waste and destruction; but\r\nnone of them have as designing a look as this! I fear me, after all,\r\nthat Thomas Hutter has journeyed into the wilderness with no fair\r\nintentions towards its happiness. Did you ever see any of the cravings\r\nof a surveyor about your father, gal?"\r\n\r\n"He is no surveyor, Deerslayer, nor does he know the use of that\r\ninstrument, though he seems to own it. Do you suppose that Thomas Hutter\r\never wore that coat? It is as much too large for him, as this instrument\r\nis beyond his learning."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--that must be it, Sarpent, and the old fellow, by some\r\nonknown means, has fallen heir to another man\'s goods! They say he has\r\nbeen a mariner, and no doubt this chist, and all it holds--ha! What have\r\nwe here?--This far out does the brass and black wood of the tool!"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had opened a small bag, from which he was taking, one by one,\r\nthe pieces of a set of chessmen. They were of ivory, much larger than\r\ncommon, and exquisitely wrought. Each piece represented the character\r\nor thing after which it is named; the knights being mounted, the castles\r\nstood on elephants, and even the pawns possessed the heads and busts of\r\nmen. The set was not complete, and a few fractures betrayed bad usage;\r\nbut all that was left had been carefully put away and preserved. Even\r\nJudith expressed wonder, as these novel objects were placed before her\r\neyes, and Chingachgook fairly forgot his Indian dignity in admiration\r\nand delight. The latter took up each piece, and examined it with never\r\ntiring satisfaction, pointing out to the girl the more ingenious and\r\nstriking portions of the workmanship. But the elephants gave him the\r\ngreatest pleasure. The "Hughs!" that he uttered, as he passed his\r\nfingers over their trunks, and ears, and tails, were very distinct,\r\nnor did he fail to note the pawns, which were armed as archers. This\r\nexhibition lasted several minutes, during which time Judith and the\r\nIndian had all the rapture to themselves. Deerslayer sat silent,\r\nthoughtful, and even gloomy, though his eyes followed each movement of\r\nthe two principal actors, noting every new peculiarity about the pieces\r\nas they were held up to view. Not an exclamation of pleasure, nor a word\r\nof condemnation passed his lips. At length his companions observed\r\nhis silence, and then, for the first time since the chessmen had been\r\ndiscovered, did he speak.\r\n\r\n"Judith," he asked earnestly, but with a concern that amounted almost to\r\ntenderness of manner, "did your parents ever talk to you of religion?"\r\n\r\nThe girl coloured, and the flashes of crimson that passed over her\r\nbeautiful countenance were like the wayward tints of a Neapolitan sky in\r\nNovember. Deerslayer had given her so strong a taste for truth,\r\nhowever, that she did not waver in her answer, replying simply and with\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n"My mother did often," she said, "my father never. I thought it made my\r\nmother sorrowful to speak of our prayers and duties, but my father has\r\nnever opened his mouth on such matters, before or since her death."\r\n\r\n"That I can believe--that I can believe. He has no God--no such God\r\nas it becomes a man of white skin to worship, or even a red-skin. Them\r\nthings are idols!"\r\n\r\nJudith started, and for a moment she seemed seriously hurt. Then she\r\nreflected, and in the end she laughed. "And you think, Deerslayer, that\r\nthese ivory toys are my father\'s Gods? I have heard of idols, and know\r\nwhat they are."\r\n\r\n"Them are idols!" repeated the other, positively. "Why should your\r\nfather keep \'em, if he doesn\'t worship \'em."\r\n\r\n"Would he keep his gods in a bag, and locked up in a chest? No, no,\r\nDeerslayer; my poor father carries his God with him, wherever he goes,\r\nand that is in his own cravings. These things may really be idols--I\r\nthink they are myself, from what I have heard and read of idolatry,\r\nbut they have come from some distant country, and like all the other\r\narticles, have fallen into Thomas Hutter\'s hands when he was a sailor."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of it--I am downright glad to hear it, Judith, for I do not\r\nthink I could have mustered the resolution to strive to help a white\r\nidolater out of his difficulties! The old man is of my colour and nation\r\nand I wish to sarve him, but as one who denied all his gifts, in the way\r\nof religion, it would have come hard to do so. That animal seems to give\r\nyou great satisfaction, Sarpent, though it\'s an idolatrous beast at the\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"It is an elephant," interrupted Judith. "I\'ve often seen pictures of\r\nsuch animals, at the garrisons, and mother had a book in which there was\r\na printed account of the creature. Father burnt that with all the other\r\nbooks, for he said Mother loved reading too well. This was not long\r\nbefore mother died, and I\'ve sometimes thought that the loss hastened\r\nher end."\r\n\r\nThis was said equally without levity and without any very deep\r\nfeeling. It was said without levity, for Judith was saddened by her\r\nrecollections, and yet she had been too much accustomed to live for\r\nself, and for the indulgence of her own vanities, to feel her mother\'s\r\nwrongs very keenly. It required extraordinary circumstances to awaken a\r\nproper sense of her situation, and to stimulate the better feelings of\r\nthis beautiful, but misguided girl, and those circumstances had not yet\r\noccurred in her brief existence.\r\n\r\n"Elephant, or no elephant, \'tis an idol," returned the hunter, "and not\r\nfit to remain in Christian keeping."\r\n\r\n"Good for Iroquois!" said Chingachgook, parting with one of the castles\r\nwith reluctance, as his friend took it from him to replace it in the\r\nbag--"Elephon buy whole tribe--buy Delaware, almost!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that it would, as any one who comprehends red-skin natur\' must\r\nknow," answered Deerslayer, "but the man that passes false money,\r\nSarpent, is as bad as he who makes it. Did you ever know a just Injin\r\nthat wouldn\'t scorn to sell a \'coon skin for the true marten, or to pass\r\noff a mink for a beaver. I know that a few of these idols, perhaps one\r\nof them elephants, would go far towards buying Thomas Hutter\'s liberty,\r\nbut it goes ag\'in conscience to pass such counterfeit money. Perhaps no\r\nInjin tribe, hereaway, is downright idolators but there\'s some that come\r\nso near it, that white gifts ought to be particular about encouraging\r\nthem in their mistake."\r\n\r\n"If idolatry is a gift, Deerslayer, and gifts are what you seem to think\r\nthem, idolatry in such people can hardly be a sin," said Judith with\r\nmore smartness than discrimination.\r\n\r\n"God grants no such gifts to any of his creatur\'s, Judith," returned the\r\nhunter, seriously. "He must be adored, under some name or other, and not\r\ncreatur\'s of brass or ivory. It matters not whether the Father of All is\r\ncalled God, or Manitou, Deity or Great Spirit, he is none the less our\r\ncommon maker and master; nor does it count for much whether the souls\r\nof the just go to Paradise, or Happy Hunting Grounds, since He may send\r\neach his own way, as suits his own pleasure and wisdom; but it curdles\r\nmy blood, when I find human mortals so bound up in darkness and consait,\r\nas to fashion the \'arth, or wood, or bones, things made by their own\r\nhands, into motionless, senseless effigies, and then fall down afore\r\nthem, and worship \'em as a Deity!"\r\n\r\n"After all, Deerslayer, these pieces of ivory may not be idols, at all.\r\nI remember, now, to have seen one of the officers at the garrison with\r\na set of fox and geese made in some such a design as these, and here is\r\nsomething hard, wrapped in cloth, that may belong to your idols."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer took the bundle the girl gave him, and unrolling it, he found\r\nthe board within. Like the pieces it was large, rich, and inlaid with\r\nebony and ivory. Putting the whole in conjunction the hunter, though\r\nnot without many misgivings, slowly came over to Judith\'s opinion, and\r\nfinally admitted that the fancied idols must be merely the curiously\r\ncarved men of some unknown game. Judith had the tact to use her victory\r\nwith great moderation, nor did she once, even in the most indirect\r\nmanner, allude to the ludicrous mistake of her companion.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of the uses of the extraordinary-looking little images\r\nsettled the affair of the proposed ransom. It was agreed generally, and\r\nall understood the weaknesses and tastes of Indians, that nothing could\r\nbe more likely to tempt the cupidity of the Iroquois than the elephants,\r\nin particular. Luckily the whole of the castles were among the pieces,\r\nand these four tower-bearing animals it was finally determined should be\r\nthe ransom offered. The remainder of the men, and, indeed, all the rest\r\nof the articles in the chest, were to be kept out of view, and to be\r\nresorted to only as a last appeal. As soon as these preliminaries were\r\nsettled, everything but those intended for the bribe was carefully\r\nreplaced in the chest, all the covers were \'tucked in\' as they had\r\nbeen found, and it was quite possible, could Hutter have been put in\r\npossession of the castle again, that he might have passed the remainder\r\nof his days in it without even suspecting the invasion that had been\r\nmade on the privacy of the chest. The rent pistol would have been the\r\nmost likely to reveal the secret, but this was placed by the side of its\r\nfellow, and all were pressed down as before, some half a dozen packages\r\nin the bottom of the chest not having been opened at all. When this was\r\ndone the lid was lowered, the padlocks replaced, and the key turned. The\r\nlatter was then replaced in the pocket from which it had been taken.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour was consumed in settling the course proper to be\r\npursued, and in returning everything to its place. The pauses to\r\nconverse were frequent, and Judith, who experienced a lively pleasure\r\nin the open, undisguised admiration with which Deerslayer\'s honest eyes\r\ngazed at her handsome face, found the means to prolong the interview,\r\nwith a dexterity that seems to be innate in female coquetry. Deerslayer,\r\nindeed, appeared to be the first who was conscious of the time that had\r\nbeen thus wasted, and to call the attention of his companions to the\r\nnecessity of doing something towards putting the plan of ransoming into\r\nexecution. Chingachgook had remained in Hutter\'s bed room, where the\r\nelephants were laid, to feast his eyes with the images of animals so\r\nwonderful, and so novel. Perhaps an instinct told him that his presence\r\nwould not be as acceptable to his companions as this holding himself\r\naloof, for Judith had not much reserve in the manifestations of her\r\npreferences, and the Delaware had not got so far as one betrothed\r\nwithout acquiring some knowledge of the symptoms of the master passion.\r\n\r\n"Well, Judith," said Deerslayer, rising, after the interview had lasted\r\nmuch longer than even he himself suspected, "\'tis pleasant convarsing\r\nwith you, and settling all these matters, but duty calls us another way.\r\nAll this time, Hurry and your father, not to say Hetty--" The word was\r\ncut short in the speaker\'s mouth, for, at that critical moment, a light\r\nstep was heard on the platform, or \'court-yard\', a human figure darkened\r\nthe doorway, and the person last mentioned stood before him. The low\r\nexclamation that escaped Deerslayer and the slight scream of Judith were\r\nhardly uttered, when an Indian youth, between the ages of fifteen and\r\nseventeen, stood beside her. These two entrances had been made with\r\nmoccasined feet, and consequently almost without noise, but, unexpected\r\nand stealthy as they were, they had not the effect to disturb\r\nDeerslayer\'s self possession. His first measure was to speak rapidly in\r\nDelaware to his friend, cautioning him to keep out of sight, while he\r\nstood on his guard; the second was to step to the door to ascertain\r\nthe extent of the danger. No one else, however, had come, and a simple\r\ncontrivance, in the shape of a raft, that lay floating at the side of\r\nthe Ark, at once explained the means that had been used in bringing\r\nHetty off. Two dead and dry, and consequently buoyant, logs of pine\r\nwere bound together with pins and withes and a little platform of riven\r\nchestnut had been rudely placed on their surfaces. Here Hetty had been\r\nseated, on a billet of wood, while the young Iroquois had rowed the\r\nprimitive and slow-moving, but perfectly safe craft from the shore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Deerslayer had taken a close survey of this raft, and\r\nsatisfied himself nothing else was near, he shook his head and muttered\r\nin his soliloquizing way--"This comes of prying into another man\'s\r\nchist! Had we been watchful, and keen eyed, such a surprise could never\r\nhave happened, and, getting this much from a boy teaches us what we\r\nmay expect when the old warriors set themselves fairly about their\r\nsarcumventions. It opens the way, howsever, to a treaty for the ransom,\r\nand I will hear what Hetty has to say."\r\n\r\nJudith, as soon as her surprise and alarm had a little abated,\r\ndiscovered a proper share of affectionate joy at the return of her\r\nsister. She folded her to her bosom, and kissed her, as had been her\r\nwont in the days of their childhood and innocence. Hetty herself was\r\nless affected, for to her there was no surprise, and her nerves were\r\nsustained by the purity and holiness of her purpose. At her sister\'s\r\nrequest she took a seat, and entered into an account of her adventures\r\nsince they had parted. Her tale commenced just as Deerslayer returned,\r\nand he also became an attentive listener, while the young Iroquois stood\r\nnear the door, seemingly as indifferent to what was passing as one of\r\nits posts.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the girl was sufficiently clear, until she reached the\r\ntime where we left her in the camp, after the interview with the chiefs,\r\nand, at the moment when Hist quitted her, in the abrupt manner already\r\nrelated. The sequel of the story may be told in her own language.\r\n\r\n"When I read the texts to the chiefs, Judith, you could not have seen\r\nthat they made any changes on their minds," she said, "but if seed is\r\nplanted, it will grow. God planted the seeds of all these trees--"\r\n\r\n"Ay that did he--that did he--" muttered Deerslayer; "and a goodly\r\nharvest has followed."\r\n\r\n"God planted the seeds of all these trees," continued Hetty, after a\r\nmoment\'s pause, "and you see to what a height and shade they have grown!\r\nSo it is with the Bible. You may read a verse this year, and forget\r\nit, and it will come back to you a year hence, when you least expect to\r\nremember it."\r\n\r\n"And did you find any thing of this among the savages, poor Hetty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Judith, and sooner and more fully than I had even hoped. I did not\r\nstay long with father and Hurry, but went to get my breakfast with Hist.\r\nAs soon as we had done the chiefs came to us, and then we found the\r\nfruits of the seed that had been planted. They said what I had read\r\nfrom the good book was right--it must be right--it sounded right; like a\r\nsweet bird singing in their ears; and they told me to come back and say\r\nas much to the great warrior who had slain one of their braves; and to\r\ntell it to you, and to say how happy they should be to come to church\r\nhere, in the castle, or to come out in the sun, and hear me read more\r\nof the sacred volume--and to tell you that they wish you would lend them\r\nsome canoes that they can bring father and Hurry and their women to the\r\ncastle, that we might all sit on the platform there and listen to the\r\nsinging of the Pale-face Manitou. There, Judith; did you ever know of\r\nany thing that so plainly shows the power of the Bible, as that!"\r\n\r\n"If it were true \'t would be a miracle, indeed, Hetty. But all this is\r\nno more than Indian cunning and Indian treachery, striving to get the\r\nbetter of us by management, when they find it is not to be done by\r\nforce."\r\n\r\n"Do you doubt the Bible, sister, that you judge the savages so harshly!"\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt the Bible, poor Hetty, but I much doubt an Indian and an\r\nIroquois. What do you say to this visit, Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"First let me talk a little with Hetty," returned the party appealed to;\r\n"Was the raft made a\'ter you had got your breakfast, gal, and did you\r\nwalk from the camp to the shore opposite to us, here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, Deerslayer. The raft was ready made and in the water--could that\r\nhave been by a miracle, Judith?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--an Indian miracle," rejoined the hunter--"They\'re expart\r\nenough in them sort of miracles. And you found the raft ready made to\r\nyour hands, and in the water, and in waiting like for its cargo?"\r\n\r\n"It was all as you say. The raft was near the camp, and the Indians\r\nput me on it, and had ropes of bark, and they dragged me to the place\r\nopposite to the castle, and then they told that young man to row me off,\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"And the woods are full of the vagabonds, waiting to know what is to be\r\nthe upshot of the miracle. We comprehend this affair, now, Judith, but\r\nI\'ll first get rid of this young Canada blood sucker, and then we\'ll\r\nsettle our own course. Do you and Hetty leave us together, first\r\nbringing me the elephants, which the Sarpent is admiring, for \'twill\r\nnever do to let this loping deer be alone a minute, or he\'ll borrow a\r\ncanoe without asking."\r\n\r\nJudith did as desired, first bringing the pieces, and retiring with her\r\nsister into their own room. Deerslayer had acquired some knowledge of\r\nmost of the Indian dialects of that region, and he knew enough of the\r\nIroquois to hold a dialogue in the language. Beckoning to the lad,\r\ntherefore, he caused him to take a seat on the chest, when he placed\r\ntwo of the castles suddenly before him. Up to that moment, this youthful\r\nsavage had not expressed a single intelligible emotion, or fancy. There\r\nwere many things, in and about the place, that were novelties to him,\r\nbut he had maintained his self-command with philosophical composure. It\r\nis true, Deerslayer had detected his dark eye scanning the defences and\r\nthe arms, but the scrutiny had been made with such an air of innocence,\r\nin such a gaping, indolent, boyish manner, that no one but a man who had\r\nhimself been taught in a similar school, would have even suspected\r\nhis object. The instant, however, the eyes of the savage fell upon the\r\nwrought ivory, and the images of the wonderful, unknown beasts, surprise\r\nand admiration got the mastery of him. The manner in which the natives\r\nof the South Sea Islands first beheld the toys of civilized life has\r\nbeen often described, but the reader is not to confound it with the\r\nmanner of an American Indian, under similar circumstances. In this\r\nparticular case, the young Iroquois or Huron permitted an exclamation of\r\nrapture to escape him, and then he checked himself like one who had\r\nbeen guilty of an indecorum. After this, his eyes ceased to wander, but\r\nbecame riveted on the elephants, one of which, after a short hesitation,\r\nhe even presumed to handle. Deerslayer did not interrupt him for\r\nquite ten minutes, knowing that the lad was taking such note of the\r\ncuriosities, as would enable him to give the most minute and accurate\r\ndescription of their appearance to his seniors, on his return. When he\r\nthought sufficient time had been allowed to produce the desired effect,\r\nthe hunter laid a finger on the naked knee of the youth and drew his\r\nattention to himself.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said; "I want to talk with my young friend from the\r\nCanadas. Let him forget that wonder for a minute."\r\n\r\n"Where t\'other pale brother?" demanded the boy, looking up and letting\r\nthe idea that had been most prominent in his mind, previously to the\r\nintroduction of the chess men, escape him involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"He sleeps, or if he isn\'t fairly asleep, he is in the room where the\r\nmen do sleep," returned Deerslayer. "How did my young friend know there\r\nwas another?"\r\n\r\n"See him from the shore. Iroquois have got long eyes--see beyond the\r\nclouds--see the bottom of the Great Spring!"\r\n\r\n"Well, the Iroquois are welcome. Two pale-faces are prisoners in the\r\ncamp of your fathers, boy."\r\n\r\nThe lad nodded, treating the circumstance with great apparent\r\nindifference; though a moment after he laughed as if exulting in the\r\nsuperior address of his own tribe.\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me, boy, what your chiefs intend to do with these\r\ncaptyves, or haven\'t they yet made up their minds?"\r\n\r\nThe lad looked a moment at the hunter with a little surprise. Then he\r\ncoolly put the end of his fore finger on his own head, just above the\r\nleft ear, and passed it round his crown with an accuracy and readiness\r\nthat showed how well he had been drilled in the peculiar art of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n"When?" demanded Deerslayer, whose gorge rose at this cool demonstration\r\nof indifference to human life. "And why not take them to your wigwams?"\r\n\r\n"Road too long, and full of pale-faces. Wigwam full, and scalps sell\r\nhigh. Small scalp, much gold."\r\n\r\n"Well that explains it--yes, that does explain it. There\'s no need of\r\nbeing any plainer. Now you know, lad, that the oldest of your prisoners\r\nis the father of these two young women, and the other is the suitor of\r\none of them. The gals nat\'rally wish to save the scalps of such fri\'nds,\r\nand they will give them two ivory creaturs, as ransom. One for each\r\nscalp. Go back and tell this to your chiefs, and bring me the answer\r\nbefore the sun sets."\r\n\r\nThe boy entered zealously into this project, and with a sincerity that\r\nleft no doubt of his executing his commission with intelligence and\r\npromptitude. For a moment he forgot his love of honor, and all his\r\nclannish hostility to the British and their Indians, in his wish to\r\nhave such a treasure in his tribe, and Deerslayer was satisfied with the\r\nimpression he had made. It is true the lad proposed to carry one of the\r\nelephants with him, as a specimen of the other, but to this his brother\r\nnegotiator was too sagacious to consent; well knowing that it might\r\nnever reach its destination if confided to such hands. This little\r\ndifficulty was soon arranged, and the boy prepared to depart. As he\r\nstood on the platform, ready to step aboard of the raft, he hesitated,\r\nand turned short with a proposal to borrow a canoe, as the means most\r\nlikely to shorten the negotiations. Deerslayer quietly refused the\r\nrequest, and, after lingering a little longer, the boy rowed slowly away\r\nfrom the castle, taking the direction of a thicket on the shore that lay\r\nless than half a mile distant. Deerslayer seated himself on a stool and\r\nwatched the progress of the ambassador, sometimes closely scanning the\r\nwhole line of shore, as far as eye could reach, and then placing an\r\nelbow on a knee, he remained a long time with his chin resting on the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview between Deerslayer and the lad, a different scene\r\ntook place in the adjoining room. Hetty had inquired for the Delaware,\r\nand being told why and where he remained concealed, she joined him. The\r\nreception which Chingachgook gave his visitor was respectful and gentle.\r\nHe understood her character, and, no doubt, his disposition to be kind\r\nto such a being was increased by the hope of learning some tidings of\r\nhis betrothed. As soon as the girl entered she took a seat, and invited\r\nthe Indian to place himself near her; then she continued silent, as if\r\nshe thought it decorous for him to question her, before she consented to\r\nspeak on the subject she had on her mind. But, as Chingachgook did not\r\nunderstand this feeling, he remained respectfully attentive to any thing\r\nshe might be pleased to tell him.\r\n\r\n"You are Chingachgook, the Great Serpent of the Delawares, ar\'n\'t\r\nyou?" the girl at length commenced, in her own simple way losing her\r\nself-command in the desire to proceed, but anxious first to make sure\r\nof the individual. "Chingachgook," returned the Delaware with grave\r\ndignity. "That say Great Sarpent, in Deerslayer tongue."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is my tongue. Deerslayer, and father, and Judith, and I,\r\nand poor Hurry Harry--do you know Henry March, Great Serpent? I know you\r\ndon\'t, however, or he would have spoken of you, too."\r\n\r\n"Did any tongue name Chingachgook, Drooping-Lily"? for so the chief had\r\nnamed poor Hetty. "Was his name sung by a little bird among Iroquois?"\r\n\r\nHetty did not answer at first, but, with that indescribable feeling that\r\nawakens sympathy and intelligence among the youthful and unpracticed\r\nof her sex, she hung her head, and the blood suffused her cheek ere she\r\nfound her tongue. It would have exceeded her stock of intelligence to\r\nexplain this embarrassment, but, though poor Hetty could not reason, on\r\nevery emergency, she could always feel. The colour slowly receded from\r\nher cheeks, and the girl looked up archly at the Indian, smiling with\r\nthe innocence of a child, mingled with the interest of a woman.\r\n\r\n"My sister, the Drooping Lily, hear such bird!" Chingachgook added, and\r\nthis with a gentleness of tone and manner that would have astonished\r\nthose who sometimes heard the discordant cries that often came from the\r\nsame throat; these transitions from the harsh and guttural, to the soft\r\nand melodious not being infrequent in ordinary Indian dialogues. "My\r\nsister\'s ears were open--has she lost her tongue?"\r\n\r\n"You are Chingachgook--you must be; for there is no other red man here,\r\nand she thought Chingachgook would come."\r\n\r\n"Chin-gach-gook," pronouncing the name slowly, and dwelling on each\r\nsyllable--"Great Sarpent, Yengeese tongue."\r\n\r\n[It is singular there should be any question concerning the origin of\r\nthe well-known sobriquet of "Yankees." Nearly all the old writers who\r\nspeak of the Indians first known to the colonists make them\r\npronounce the word "English" as "Yengeese." Even at this day, it is a\r\nprovincialism of New England to say "Anglish" instead of "Inglish," and\r\nthere is a close conformity of sound between "Anglish" and "yengeese,"\r\nmore especially if the latter word, as was probably the case, be\r\npronounced short. The transition from "Yengeese," thus pronounced, to\r\n"Yankees" is quite easy. If the former is pronounced "Yangis," it is\r\nalmost identical with "Yankees," and Indian words have seldom been spelt\r\nas they are pronounced. Thus the scene of this tale is spelt "Otsego,"\r\nand is properly pronounced "Otsago." The liquids of the Indians would\r\neasily convert "En" into "Yen."]\r\n\r\n"Chin-gach-gook," repeated Hetty, in the same deliberate manner. "Yes,\r\nso Hist called it, and you must be the chief."\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah," added the Delaware.\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah, or Hist-oh-Hist. I think Hist prettier than Wah, and so I\r\ncall her Hist."\r\n\r\n"Wah very sweet in Delaware ears!"\r\n\r\n"You make it sound differently from me. But, never mind, I did hear the\r\nbird you speak of sing, Great Serpent."\r\n\r\n"Will my sister say words of song? What she sing most--how she\r\nlook--often she laugh?"\r\n\r\n"She sang Chin-gach-gook oftener than any thing else; and she laughed\r\nheartily, when I told how the Iroquois waded into the water after us,\r\nand couldn\'t catch us. I hope these logs haven\'t ears, Serpent!"\r\n\r\n"No fear logs; fear sister next room. No fear Iroquois; Deerslayer stuff\r\nhis eyes and ears with strange beast."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Serpent, and I understood Hist. Sometimes I think I\'m\r\nnot half as feeble minded as they say I am. Now, do you look up at the\r\nroof, and I\'ll tell you all. But you frighten me, you look so eager when\r\nI speak of Hist."\r\n\r\nThe Indian controlled his looks, and affected to comply with the simple\r\nrequest of the girl.\r\n\r\n"Hist told me to say, in a very low voice, that you mustn\'t trust the\r\nIroquois in anything. They are more artful than any Indians she knows.\r\nThen she says that there is a large bright star that comes over the\r\nhill, about an hour after dark"--Hist had pointed out the planet\r\nJupiter, without knowing it--"and just as that star comes in sight, she\r\nwill be on the point, where I landed last night, and that you must come\r\nfor her, in a canoe."\r\n\r\n"Good--Chingachgook understand well enough, now; but he understand\r\nbetter if my sister sing him ag\'in."\r\n\r\nHetty repeated her words, more fully explaining what star was meant, and\r\nmentioning the part of the point where he was to venture ashore. She now\r\nproceeded in her own unsophisticated way to relate her intercourse with\r\nthe Indian maid, and to repeat several of her expressions and opinions\r\nthat gave great delight to the heart of her betrothed. She particularly\r\nrenewed her injunctions to be on their guard against treachery, a\r\nwarning that was scarcely needed, however, as addressed to men as\r\nwary as those to whom it was sent. She also explained with sufficient\r\nclearness, for on all such subjects the mind of the girl seldom failed\r\nher, the present state of the enemy, and the movements they had made\r\nsince morning. Hist had been on the raft with her until it quitted the\r\nshore, and was now somewhere in the woods, opposite to the castle, and\r\ndid not intend to return to the camp until night approached; when she\r\nhoped to be able to slip away from her companions, as they followed\r\nthe shore on their way home, and conceal herself on the point. No\r\none appeared to suspect the presence of Chingachgook, though it was\r\nnecessarily known that an Indian had entered the Ark the previous night,\r\nand it was suspected that he had since appeared in and about the castle\r\nin the dress of a pale-face. Still some little doubt existed on the\r\nlatter point, for, as this was the season when white men might be\r\nexpected to arrive, there was some fear that the garrison of the castle\r\nwas increasing by these ordinary means. All this had Hist communicated\r\nto Hetty while the Indians were dragging them along shore, the distance,\r\nwhich exceeded six miles, affording abundance of time.\r\n\r\n"Hist don\'t know, herself, whether they suspect her or not, or whether\r\nthey suspect you, but she hopes neither is the case. And now, Serpent,\r\nsince I have told you so much from your betrothed," continued Hetty,\r\nunconsciously taking one of the Indian\'s hands, and playing with the\r\nfingers, as a child is often seen to play with those of a parent, "you\r\nmust let me tell you something from myself. When you marry Hist, you\r\nmust be kind to her, and smile on her, as you do now on me, and not look\r\ncross as some of the chiefs do at their squaws. Will you promise this?"\r\n\r\n"Alway good to Wah!--too tender to twist hard; else she break."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and smile, too; you don\'t know how much a girl craves smiles\r\nfrom them she loves. Father scarce smiled on me once, while I was with\r\nhim--and, Hurry--Yes--Hurry talked loud and laughed, but I don\'t think\r\nhe smiled once either. You know the difference between a smile and a\r\nlaugh?"\r\n\r\n"Laugh, best. Hear Wah laugh, think bird sing!"\r\n\r\n"I know that; her laugh is pleasant, but you must smile. And then,\r\nSerpent, you mustn\'t make her carry burthens and hoe corn, as so many\r\nIndians do; but treat her more as the pale-faces treat their wives."\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah no pale-face--got red-skin; red heart, red feelin\'s. All\r\nred; no pale-face. Must carry papoose."\r\n\r\n"Every woman is willing to carry her child," said Hetty smiling, "and\r\nthere is no harm in that. But you must love Hist, and be gentle, and\r\ngood to her; for she is gentle and good herself."\r\n\r\nChingachgook gravely bowed, and then he seemed to think this part of the\r\nsubject might be dismissed. Before there was time for Hetty to resume\r\nher communications, the voice of Deerslayer was heard calling on his\r\nfriend, in the outer room. At this summons the Serpent arose to obey,\r\nand Hetty joined her sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "\'A stranger animal,\' cries one,\r\n    \'Sure never liv\'d beneath the sun;\r\n    A lizard\'s body lean and long,\r\n    A fish\'s head, a serpent\'s tongue,\r\n    Its foot, with triple claw disjoined;\r\n    And what a length of tail behind!\'"\r\n\r\n    James Merrick, "The Chameleon," 11.21-26.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Delaware, on rejoining his friend, was to proceed\r\ngravely to disencumber himself of his civilized attire, and to stand\r\nforth an Indian warrior again. The protest of Deerslayer was met by his\r\ncommunicating the fact that the presence of an Indian in the hut was\r\nknown to the Iroquois, and that maintaining the disguise would be more\r\nlikely to direct suspicions to his real object, than if he came out\r\nopenly as a member of a hostile tribe. When the latter understood the\r\ntruth, and was told that he had been deceived in supposing the chief had\r\nsucceeded in entering the Ark undiscovered, he cheerfully consented to\r\nthe change, since further attempt at concealment was useless. A gentler\r\nfeeling than the one avowed, however, lay at the bottom of the Indian\'s\r\ndesire to appear as a son of the forest. He had been told that Hist was\r\non the opposite shore, and nature so far triumphed over all distinctions\r\nof habit, and tribes and people, as to reduce this young savage warrior\r\nto the level of a feeling which would have been found in the most\r\nrefined inhabitant of a town, under similar circumstances. There was a\r\nmild satisfaction in believing that she he loved could see him, and as\r\nhe walked out on the platform in his scanty, native attire, an Apollo\r\nof the wilderness, a hundred of the tender fancies that fleet through\r\nlovers\' brains beset his imagination and softened his heart. All this\r\nwas lost on Deerslayer, who was no great adept in the mysteries of\r\nCupid, but whose mind was far more occupied with the concerns that\r\nforced themselves on his attention, than with any of the truant fancies\r\nof love. He soon recalled his companion, therefore, to a sense of their\r\nactual condition, by summoning him to a sort of council of war, in which\r\nthey were to settle their future course. In the dialogue that followed,\r\nthe parties mutually made each other acquainted with what had passed\r\nin their several interviews. Chingachgook was told the history of the\r\ntreaty about the ransom, and Deerslayer heard the whole of Hetty\'s\r\ncommunications. The latter listened with generous interest to his\r\nfriend\'s hopes, and promised cheerfully all the assistance he could\r\nlend.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis our main ar\'n\'d, Sarpent, as you know, this battling for the\r\ncastle and old Hutter\'s darters, coming in as a sort of accident.\r\nYes--yes--I\'ll be actyve in helping little Hist, who\'s not only one\r\nof the best and handsomest maidens of the tribe, but the very best and\r\nhandsomest. I\'ve always encouraged you, chief, in that liking, and it\'s\r\nproper, too, that a great and ancient race like your\'n shouldn\'t come to\r\nan end. If a woman of red skin and red gifts could get to be near enough\r\nto me to wish her for a wife, I\'d s\'arch for just such another, but that\r\ncan never be; no, that can never be. I\'m glad Hetty has met with\r\nHist, howsever, for though the first is a little short of wit and\r\nunderstanding, the last has enough for both. Yes, Sarpent," laughing\r\nheartily--"put \'em together, and two smarter gals isn\'t to be found in\r\nall York Colony!"\r\n\r\n"I will go to the Iroquois camp," returned the Delaware, gravely. "No\r\none knows Chingachgook but Wah, and a treaty for lives and scalps\r\nshould be made by a chief. Give me the strange beasts, and let me take a\r\ncanoe."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer dropped his head and played with the end of a fish-pole in\r\nthe water, as he sat dangling his legs over the edge of the platform,\r\nlike a man who was lost in thought by the sudden occurrence of a novel\r\nidea. Instead of directly answering the proposal of his friend, he began\r\nto soliloquize, a circumstance however that in no manner rendered\r\nhis words more true, as he was remarkable for saying what he thought,\r\nwhether the remarks were addressed to himself, or to any one else.\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--" he said--"this must be what they call love! I\'ve heard\r\nsay that it sometimes upsets reason altogether, leaving a young man as\r\nhelpless, as to calculation and caution, as a brute beast. To think that\r\nthe Sarpent should be so lost to reason, and cunning, and wisdom! We\r\nmust sartainly manage to get Hist off, and have \'em married as soon\r\nas we get back to the tribe, or this war will be of no more use to the\r\nchief, than a hunt a little oncommon extr\'ornary. Yes--Yes--he\'ll never\r\nbe the man he was, till this matter is off his mind, and he comes to his\r\nsenses like all the rest of mankind. Sarpent, you can\'t be in airnest,\r\nand therefore I shall say but little to your offer. But you\'re a chief,\r\nand will soon be sent out on the war path at head of the parties, and\r\nI\'ll just ask if you\'d think of putting your forces into the inimy\'s\r\nhands, afore the battle is fou\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Wah!" ejaculated the Indian.\r\n\r\n"Ay--Wah--I know well enough it\'s Wah, and altogether Wah--Ra\'ally,\r\nSarpent, I\'m consarned and mortified about you! I never heard so weak an\r\nidee come from a chief, and he, too, one that\'s already got a name for\r\nbeing wise, young and inexper\'enced as he is. Canoe you sha\'n\'t have, so\r\nlong as the v\'ice of fri\'ndship and warning can count for any thing."\r\n\r\n"My pale-face friend is right. A cloud came over the face of\r\nChingachgook, and weakness got into his mind, while his eyes were dim.\r\nMy brother has a good memory for good deeds, and a weak memory for bad.\r\nHe will forget."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s easy enough. Say no more about it chief, but if another\r\nof them clouds blow near you, do your endivours to get out of its way.\r\nClouds are bad enough in the weather, but when they come to the reason,\r\nit gets to be serious. Now, sit down by me here, and let us calculate\r\nour movements a little, for we shall soon either have a truce and\r\na peace, or we shall come to an actyve and bloody war. You see the\r\nvagabonds can make logs sarve their turn, as well as the best raftsmen\r\non the rivers, and it would be no great expl\'ite for them to invade us\r\nin a body. I\'ve been thinking of the wisdom of putting all old Tom\'s\r\nstores into the Ark, of barring and locking up the Castle, and of taking\r\nto the Ark, altogether. That is moveable, and by keeping the sail up,\r\nand shifting places, we might worry through a great many nights, without\r\nthem Canada wolves finding a way into our sheep fold!"\r\n\r\nChingachgook listened to this plan with approbation. Did the negotiation\r\nfail, there was now little hope that the night would pass without\r\nan assault, and the enemy had sagacity enough to understand that\r\nin carrying the castle they would probably become masters of all it\r\ncontained, the offered ransom included, and still retain the advantages\r\nthey had hitherto gained. Some precaution of the sort appeared to be\r\nabsolutely necessary, for now the numbers of the Iroquois were known, a\r\nnight attack could scarcely be successfully met. It would be impossible\r\nto prevent the enemy from getting possession of the canoes and the Ark,\r\nand the latter itself would be a hold in which the assailants would be\r\nas effectually protected against bullets as were those in the building.\r\nFor a few minutes, both the men thought of sinking the Ark in the\r\nshallow water, of bringing the canoes into the house, and of depending\r\naltogether on the castle for protection. But reflection satisfied them\r\nthat, in the end, this expedient would fail. It was so easy to collect\r\nlogs on the shore, and to construct a raft of almost any size, that it\r\nwas certain the Iroquois, now they had turned their attention to\r\nsuch means, would resort to them seriously, so long as there was the\r\ncertainty of success by perseverance. After deliberating maturely,\r\nand placing all the considerations fairly before them, the two young\r\nbeginners in the art of forest warfare settled down into the opinion\r\nthat the Ark offered the only available means of security. This decision\r\nwas no sooner come to, than it was communicated to Judith. The girl\r\nhad no serious objection to make, and all four set about the measures\r\nnecessary to carrying the plan into execution.\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily understand that Floating Tom\'s worldly goods\r\nwere of no great amount. A couple of beds, some wearing apparel, the\r\narms and ammunition, a few cooking utensils, with the mysterious and\r\nbut half examined chest formed the principal items. These were all soon\r\nremoved, the Ark having been hauled on the eastern side of the building,\r\nso that the transfer could be made without being seen from the shore. It\r\nwas thought unnecessary to disturb the heavier and coarser articles of\r\nfurniture, as they were not required in the Ark, and were of but little\r\nvalue in themselves. As great caution was necessary in removing the\r\ndifferent objects, most of which were passed out of a window with a view\r\nto conceal what was going on, it required two or three hours before all\r\ncould be effected. By the expiration of that time, the raft made its\r\nappearance, moving from the shore. Deerslayer immediately had recourse\r\nto the glass, by the aid of which he perceived that two warriors were\r\non it, though they appeared to be unarmed. The progress of the raft was\r\nslow, a circumstance that formed one of the great advantages that would\r\nbe possessed by the scow, in any future collision between them, the\r\nmovements of the latter being comparatively swift and light. As there\r\nwas time to make the dispositions for the reception of the two dangerous\r\nvisitors, everything was prepared for them, long before they had got\r\nnear enough to be hailed. The Serpent and the girls retired into the\r\nbuilding, where the former stood near the door, well provided with\r\nrifles, while Judith watched the proceedings without through a loop. As\r\nfor Deerslayer, he had brought a stool to the edge of the platform, at\r\nthe point towards which the raft was advancing, and taken his seat with\r\nhis rifle leaning carelessly between his legs.\r\n\r\nAs the raft drew nearer, every means possessed by the party in the\r\ncastle was resorted to, in order to ascertain if their visitors had any\r\nfirearms. Neither Deerslayer nor Chingachgook could discover any, but\r\nJudith, unwilling to trust to simple eyesight, thrust the glass through\r\nthe loop, and directed it towards the hemlock boughs that lay between\r\nthe two logs of the raft, forming a sort of flooring, as well as a seat\r\nfor the use of the rowers. When the heavy moving craft was within fifty\r\nfeet of him, Deerslayer hailed the Hurons, directing them to cease\r\nrowing, it not being his intention to permit them to land. Compliance,\r\nof course, was necessary, and the two grim-looking warriors instantly\r\nquitted their seats, though the raft continued slowly to approach, until\r\nit had driven in much nearer to the platform.\r\n\r\n"Are ye chiefs?" demanded Deerslayer with dignity--"Are ye chiefs?--Or\r\nhave the Mingos sent me warriors without names, on such an ar\'n\'d? If\r\nso, the sooner ye go back, the sooner them will be likely to come that a\r\nwarrior can talk with."\r\n\r\n"Hugh!" exclaimed the elder of the two on the raft, rolling his glowing\r\neyes over the different objects that were visible in and about the\r\nCastle, with a keenness that showed how little escaped him. "My brother\r\nis very proud, but Rivenoak (we use the literal translation of the term,\r\nwriting as we do in English) is a name to make a Delaware turn pale."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, or it\'s a lie, Rivenoak, as it may be; but I am not likely\r\nto turn pale, seeing that I was born pale. What\'s your ar\'n\'d, and why\r\ndo you come among light bark canoes, on logs that are not even dug out?"\r\n\r\n"The Iroquois are not ducks, to walk on water! Let the pale-faces give\r\nthem a canoe, and they\'ll come in a canoe."\r\n\r\n"That\'s more rational, than likely to come to pass. We have but four\r\ncanoes, and being four persons that\'s only one for each of us. We thank\r\nyou for the offer, howsever, though we ask leave not to accept it. You\r\nare welcome, Iroquois, on your logs."\r\n\r\n"Thanks--My young pale-face warrior--he has got a name--how do the\r\nchiefs call him?"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer hesitated a moment, and a gleam of pride and human weakness\r\ncame over him. He smiled, muttered between his teeth, and then looking\r\nup proudly, he said--"Mingo, like all who are young and actyve, I\'ve\r\nbeen known by different names, at different times. One of your warriors\r\nwhose spirit started for the Happy Grounds of your people, as lately\r\nas yesterday morning, thought I desarved to be known by the name of\r\nHawkeye, and this because my sight happened to be quicker than his own,\r\nwhen it got to be life or death atween us."\r\n\r\nChingachgook, who was attentively listening to all that passed, heard\r\nand understood this proof of passing weakness in his friend, and on\r\na future occasion he questioned him more closely concerning the\r\ntransaction on the point, where Deerslayer had first taken human life.\r\nWhen he had got the whole truth, he did not fail to communicate it to\r\nthe tribe, from which time the young hunter was universally known among\r\nthe Delawares by an appellation so honorably earned. As this, however,\r\nwas a period posterior to all the incidents of this tale, we shall\r\ncontinue to call the young hunter by the name under which he has been\r\nfirst introduced to the reader. Nor was the Iroquois less struck with\r\nthe vaunt of the white man. He knew of the death of his comrade, and had\r\nno difficulty in understanding the allusion, the intercourse between the\r\nconqueror and his victim on that occasion having been seen by several\r\nsavages on the shore of the lake, who had been stationed at different\r\npoints just within the margin of bushes to watch the drifting canoes,\r\nand who had not time to reach the scene of action, ere the victor had\r\nretired. The effect on this rude being of the forest was an exclamation\r\nof surprise; then such a smile of courtesy, and wave of the hand,\r\nsucceeded, as would have done credit to Asiatic diplomacy. The two\r\nIroquois spoke to each other in low tones, and both drew near the end of\r\nthe raft that was closest to the platform.\r\n\r\n"My brother, Hawkeye, has sent a message to the Hurons," resumed\r\nRivenoak, "and it has made their hearts very glad. They hear he has\r\nimages of beasts with two tails! Will he show them to his friends?"\r\n\r\n"Inimies would be truer," returned Deerslayer, "but sound isn\'t sense,\r\nand does little harm. Here is one of the images; I toss it to you under\r\nfaith of treaties. If it\'s not returned, the rifle will settle the p\'int\r\natween us."\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois seemed to acquiesce in the conditions, and Deerslayer arose\r\nand prepared to toss one of the elephants to the raft, both parties\r\nusing all the precaution that was necessary to prevent its loss. As\r\npractice renders men expert in such things, the little piece of ivory\r\nwas soon successfully transferred from one hand to the other, and then\r\nfollowed another scene on the raft, in which astonishment and delight\r\ngot the mastery of Indian stoicism. These two grim old warriors\r\nmanifested even more feeling, as they examined the curiously wrought\r\nchessman, than had been betrayed by the boy; for, in the case of the\r\nlatter, recent schooling had interposed its influence; while the men,\r\nlike all who are sustained by well established characters, were not\r\nashamed to let some of their emotions be discovered. For a few minutes\r\nthey apparently lost the consciousness of their situation, in the\r\nintense scrutiny they bestowed on a material so fine, work so highly\r\nwrought, and an animal so extraordinary. The lip of the moose is,\r\nperhaps, the nearest approach to the trunk of the elephant that is to\r\nbe found in the American forest, but this resemblance was far from being\r\nsufficiently striking to bring the new creature within the range of\r\ntheir habits and ideas, and the more they studied the image, the greater\r\nwas their astonishment. Nor did these children of the forest mistake\r\nthe structure on the back of the elephant for a part of the animal. They\r\nwere familiar with horses and oxen, and had seen towers in the Canadas,\r\nand found nothing surprising in creatures of burthen. Still, by a very\r\nnatural association, they supposed the carving meant to represent that\r\nthe animal they saw was of a strength sufficient to carry a fort on its\r\nback; a circumstance that in no degree lessened their wonder.\r\n\r\n"Has my pale-face brother any more such beasts?" at last the senior of\r\nthe Iroquois asked, in a sort of petitioning manner.\r\n\r\n"There\'s more where them came from, Mingo," was the answer; "one is\r\nenough, howsever, to buy off fifty scalps."\r\n\r\n"One of my prisoners is a great warrior--tall as a pine--strong as the\r\nmoose--active as a deer--fierce as the panther! Some day he\'ll be a\r\ngreat chief, and lead the army of King George!"\r\n\r\n"Tut-tut Mingo; Hurry Harry is Hurry Harry, and you\'ll never make\r\nmore than a corporal of him, if you do that. He\'s tall enough, of a\r\nsartainty; but that\'s of no use, as he only hits his head ag\'in the\r\nbranches as he goes through the forest. He\'s strong too, but a strong\r\nbody isn\'t a strong head, and the king\'s generals are not chosen for\r\ntheir sinews; he\'s swift, if you will, but a rifle bullet is swifter;\r\nand as for f\'erceness, it\'s no great ricommend to a soldier; they that\r\nthink they feel the stoutest often givin\' out at the pinch. No, no,\r\nyou\'ll niver make Hurry\'s scalp pass for more than a good head of curly\r\nhair, and a rattle pate beneath it!"\r\n\r\n"My old prisoner very wise--king of the lake--great warrior, wise\r\ncounsellor!"\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s them that might gainsay all this, too, Mingo. A very wise\r\nman wouldn\'t be apt to be taken in so foolish a manner as befell Master\r\nHutter, and if he gives good counsel, he must have listened to very bad\r\nin that affair. There\'s only one king of this lake, and he\'s a long way\r\noff, and isn\'t likely ever to see it. Floating Tom is some such king of\r\nthis region, as the wolf that prowls through the woods is king of the\r\nforest. A beast with two tails is well worth two such scalps!"\r\n\r\n"But my brother has another beast?--He will give two"--holding up as\r\nmany fingers, "for old father?"\r\n\r\n"Floating Tom is no father of mine, but he\'ll fare none the worse for\r\nthat. As for giving two beasts for his scalp, and each beast with two\r\ntails, it is quite beyond reason. Think yourself well off, Mingo, if you\r\nmake a much worse trade."\r\n\r\nBy this time the self-command of Rivenoak had got the better of his\r\nwonder, and he began to fall back on his usual habits of cunning, in\r\norder to drive the best bargain he could. It would be useless to relate\r\nmore than the substance of the desultory dialogue that followed, in\r\nwhich the Indian manifested no little management, in endeavoring\r\nto recover the ground lost under the influence of surprise. He even\r\naffected to doubt whether any original for the image of the beast\r\nexisted, and asserted that the oldest Indian had never heard a tradition\r\nof any such animal. Little did either of them imagine at the time that\r\nlong ere a century elapsed, the progress of civilization would bring\r\neven much more extraordinary and rare animals into that region, as\r\ncuriosities to be gazed at by the curious, and that the particular\r\nbeast, about which the disputants contended, would be seen laving its\r\nsides and swimming in the very sheet of water, on which they had met.\r\n\r\n[The Otsego is a favorite place for the caravan keepers to let\r\ntheir elephants bathe. The writer has seen two at a time, since the\r\npublication of this book, swimming about in company.]\r\n\r\nAs is not uncommon on such occasions, one of the parties got a little\r\nwarm in the course of the discussion, for Deerslayer met all the\r\narguments and prevarication of his subtle opponent with his own cool\r\ndirectness of manner, and unmoved love of truth. What an elephant was he\r\nknew little better than the savage, but he perfectly understood that\r\nthe carved pieces of ivory must have some such value in the eyes of an\r\nIroquois as a bag of gold or a package of beaver skins would in those of\r\na trader. Under the circumstances, therefore, he felt it to be\r\nprudent not to concede too much at first, since there existed a\r\nnearly unconquerable obstacle to making the transfers, even after the\r\ncontracting parties had actually agreed upon the terms. Keeping this\r\ndifficulty in view, he held the extra chessmen in reserve, as a means of\r\nsmoothing any difficulty in the moment of need.\r\n\r\nAt length the savage pretended that further negotiation was useless,\r\nsince he could not be so unjust to his tribe as to part with the\r\nhonor and emoluments of two excellent, full grown male scalps for\r\na consideration so trifling as a toy like that he had seen, and he\r\nprepared to take his departure. Both parties now felt as men are wont to\r\nfeel, when a bargain that each is anxious to conclude is on the eve of\r\nbeing broken off, in consequence of too much pertinacity in the way\r\nof management. The effect of the disappointment was very different,\r\nhowever, on the respective individuals. Deerslayer was mortified, and\r\nfilled with regret, for he not only felt for the prisoners, but he also\r\nfelt deeply for the two girls. The conclusion of the treaty, therefore,\r\nleft him melancholy and full of regret. With the savage, his defeat\r\nproduced the desire of revenge. In a moment of excitement, he had loudly\r\nannounced his intention to say no more, and he felt equally enraged with\r\nhimself and with his cool opponent, that he had permitted a pale face to\r\nmanifest more indifference and self-command than an Indian chief. When\r\nhe began to urge his raft away from the platform his countenance lowered\r\nand his eye glowed, even while he affected a smile of amity and a\r\ngesture of courtesy at parting.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time to overcome the inertia of the logs, and while\r\nthis was being done by the silent Indian, Rivenoak stalked over the\r\nhemlock boughs that lay between the logs in sullen ferocity, eyeing\r\nkeenly the while the hut, the platform and the person of his late\r\ndisputant. Once he spoke in low, quick tones to his companion, and he\r\nstirred the boughs with his feet like an animal that is restive. At that\r\nmoment the watchfulness of Deerslayer had a little abated, for he sat\r\nmusing on the means of renewing the negotiation without giving too much\r\nadvantage to the other side. It was perhaps fortunate for him that the\r\nkeen and bright eyes of Judith were as vigilant as ever. At the instant\r\nwhen the young man was least on his guard, and his enemy was the most\r\non the alert, she called out in a warning voice to the former, most\r\nopportunely giving the alarm.\r\n\r\n"Be on your guard, Deerslayer," the girl cried--"I see rifles with the\r\nglass, beneath the hemlock brush, and the Iroquois is loosening them\r\nwith his feet!"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the enemy had carried their artifices so far as to\r\nemploy an agent who understood English. The previous dialogue had taken\r\nplace in his own language, but it was evident by the sudden manner in\r\nwhich his feet ceased their treacherous occupation, and in which the\r\ncountenance of Rivenoak changed from sullen ferocity to a smile of\r\ncourtesy, that the call of the girl was understood. Signing to his\r\ncompanion to cease his efforts to set the logs in motion, he advanced to\r\nthe end of the raft which was nearest to the platform, and spoke.\r\n\r\n"Why should Rivenoak and his brother leave any cloud between them," he\r\nsaid. "They are both wise, both brave, and both generous; they ought to\r\npart friends. One beast shall be the price of one prisoner."\r\n\r\n"And, Mingo," answered the other, delighted to renew the negotiations on\r\nalmost any terms, and determined to clinch the bargain if possible by a\r\nlittle extra liberality, "you\'ll see that a pale-face knows how to pay\r\na full price, when he trades with an open heart, and an open hand. Keep\r\nthe beast that you had forgotten to give back to me, as you was about to\r\nstart, and which I forgot to ask for, on account of consarn at parting\r\nin anger. Show it to your chiefs. When you bring us our fri\'nds, two\r\nmore shall be added to it, and," hesitating a moment in distrust of the\r\nexpediency of so great a concession; then, deciding in its favor--"and,\r\nif we see them afore the sun sets, we may find a fourth to make up an\r\neven number."\r\n\r\nThis settled the matter. Every gleam of discontent vanished from the\r\ndark countenance of the Iroquois, and he smiled as graciously, if not as\r\nsweetly, as Judith Hutter, herself. The piece already in his possession\r\nwas again examined, and an ejaculation of pleasure showed how much he\r\nwas pleased with this unexpected termination of the affair. In point of\r\nfact, both he and Deerslayer had momentarily forgotten what had become\r\nof the subject of their discussion, in the warmth of their feelings, but\r\nsuch had not been the case with Rivenoak\'s companion. This man retained\r\nthe piece, and had fully made up his mind, were it claimed under such\r\ncircumstances as to render its return necessary, to drop it in the lake,\r\ntrusting to his being able to find it again at some future day. This\r\ndesperate expedient, however, was no longer necessary, and after\r\nrepeating the terms of agreement, and professing to understand them,\r\nthe two Indians finally took their departure, moving slowly towards the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n"Can any faith be put in such wretches?" asked Judith, when she and\r\nHetty had come out on the platform, and were standing at the side of\r\nDeerslayer, watching the dull movement of the logs. "Will they not\r\nrather keep the toy they have, and send us off some bloody proofs of\r\ntheir getting the better of us in cunning, by way of boasting? I\'ve\r\nheard of acts as bad as this."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, Judith; no manner of doubt, if it wasn\'t for Indian natur\'.\r\nBut I\'m no judge of a red-skin, if that two tail\'d beast doesn\'t set\r\nthe whole tribe in some such stir as a stick raises in a beehive! Now,\r\nthere\'s the Sarpent; a man with narves like flint, and no more cur\'osity\r\nin every day consarns than is befitting prudence; why he was so overcome\r\nwith the sight of the creatur\', carved as it is in bone, that I felt\r\nashamed for him! That\'s just their gifts, howsever, and one can\'t well\r\nquarrel with a man for his gifts, when they are lawful. Chingachgook\r\nwill soon get over his weakness and remember that he\'s a chief, and\r\nthat he comes of a great stock, and has a renowned name to support and\r\nuphold; but as for yonder scamps, there\'ll be no peace among \'em until\r\nthey think they\'ve got possession of every thing of the natur\' of that\r\nbit of carved bone that\'s to be found among Thomas Hutter\'s stores!"\r\n\r\n"They only know of the elephants, and can have no hopes about the other\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Judith; still, covetousness is a craving feelin\'! They\'ll\r\nsay, if the pale-faces have these cur\'ous beasts with two tails, who\r\nknows but they\'ve got some with three, or for that matter with four!\r\nThat\'s what the schoolmasters call nat\'ral arithmetic, and \'twill be\r\nsartain to beset the feelin\'s of savages. They\'ll never be easy, till\r\nthe truth is known."\r\n\r\n"Do you think, Deerslayer," inquired Hetty, in her simple and innocent\r\nmanner, "that the Iroquois won\'t let father and Hurry go? I read to them\r\nseveral of the very best verses in the whole Bible, and you see what\r\nthey have done, already."\r\n\r\nThe hunter, as he always did, listened kindly and even affectionately to\r\nHetty\'s remarks; then he mused a moment in silence. There was something\r\nlike a flush on his cheek as he answered, after quite a minute had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether a white man ought to be ashamed, or not, to own he\r\ncan\'t read, but such is my case, Judith. You are skilful, I find, in all\r\nsuch matters, while I have only studied the hand of God as it is seen in\r\nthe hills and the valleys, the mountain-tops, the streams, the forests\r\nand the springs. Much l\'arning may be got in this way, as well as out\r\nof books; and, yet, I sometimes think it is a white man\'s gift to read!\r\nWhen I hear from the mouths of the Moravians the words of which Hetty\r\nspeaks, they raise a longing in my mind, and I then think I will know\r\nhow to read \'em myself; but the game in summer, and the traditions, and\r\nlessons in war, and other matters, have always kept me behind hand."\r\n\r\n"Shall I teach you, Deerslayer?" asked Hetty, earnestly. "I\'m\r\nweak-minded, they say, but I can read as well as Judith. It might save\r\nyour life to know how to read the Bible to the savages, and it will\r\ncertainly save your soul; for mother told me that, again and again!"\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Hetty--yes, thankee, with all my heart. These are like to be\r\ntoo stirring times for much idleness, but after it\'s peace, and I come\r\nto see you ag\'in on this lake, then I\'ll give myself up to it, as if\r\n\'twas pleasure and profit in a single business. Perhaps I ought to\r\nbe ashamed, Judith, that \'tis so; but truth is truth. As for these\r\nIroquois, \'tisn\'t very likely they\'ll forget a beast with two tails, on\r\naccount of a varse or two from the Bible. I rather expect they\'ll give\r\nup the prisoners, and trust to some sarcumvenion or other to get \'em\r\nback ag\'in, with us and all in the castle and the Ark in the bargain.\r\nHowsever, we must humour the vagabonds, first to get your father and\r\nHurry out of their hands, and next to keep the peace atween us, until\r\nsuch time as the Sarpent there can make out to get off his betrothed\r\nwife. If there\'s any sudden outbreakin\' of anger and ferocity, the\r\nIndians will send off all their women and children to the camp at once,\r\nwhereas, by keeping \'em calm and trustful we may manage to meet Hist at\r\nthe spot she has mentioned. Rather than have the bargain fall through,\r\nnow, I\'d throw in half a dozen of them effigy bow-and-arrow men, such as\r\nwe\'ve in plenty in the chist."\r\n\r\nJudith cheerfully assented, for she would have resigned even the\r\nflowered brocade, rather than not redeem her father and please\r\nDeerslayer. The prospects of success were now so encouraging as to\r\nraise the spirits of all in the castle, though a due watchfulness of\r\nthe movements of the enemy was maintained. Hour passed after hour,\r\nnotwithstanding, and the sun had once more begun to fall towards the\r\nsummits of the western hills, and yet no signs were seen of the return\r\nof the raft. By dint of sweeping the shore with the glass, Deerslayer\r\nat length discovered a place in the dense and dark woods where, he\r\nentertained no doubt, the Iroquois were assembled in considerable\r\nnumbers. It was near the thicket whence the raft had issued, and a\r\nlittle rill that trickled into the lake announced the vicinity of\r\na spring. Here, then, the savages were probably holding their\r\nconsultation, and the decision was to be made that went to settle the\r\nquestion of life or death for the prisoners. There was one ground for\r\nhope in spite of the delay, however, that Deerslayer did not fail to\r\nplace before his anxious companions. It was far more probable that\r\nthe Indians had left their prisoners in the camp, than that they had\r\nencumbered themselves by causing them to follow through the woods a\r\nparty that was out on a merely temporary excursion. If such was the\r\nfact, it required considerable time to send a messenger the necessary\r\ndistance, and to bring the two white men to the spot where they were\r\nto embark. Encouraged by these reflections, a new stock of patience was\r\ngathered, and the declension of the sun was viewed with less alarm.\r\n\r\nThe result justified Deerslayer\'s conjecture. Not long before the\r\nsun had finally disappeared, the two logs were seen coming out of the\r\nthicket, again, and as it drew near, Judith announced that her father\r\nand Hurry, both of them pinioned, lay on the bushes in the centre. As\r\nbefore, the two Indians were rowing. The latter seemed to be conscious\r\nthat the lateness of the hour demanded unusual exertions, and contrary\r\nto the habits of their people, who are ever averse to toil, they labored\r\nhard at the rude substitutes for oars. In consequence of this diligence,\r\nthe raft occupied its old station in about half the time that had been\r\ntaken in the previous visits.\r\n\r\nEven after the conditions were so well understood, and matters had\r\nproceeded so far, the actual transfer of the prisoners was not a duty\r\nto be executed without difficulty. The Iroquois were compelled to\r\nplace great reliance on the good faith of their foes, though it\r\nwas reluctantly given; and was yielded to necessity rather than to\r\nconfidence. As soon as Hutter and Hurry should be released, the party\r\nin the castle numbered two to one, as opposed to those on the raft, and\r\nescape by flight was out of the question, as the former had three bark\r\ncanoes, to say nothing of the defences of the house and the Ark. All\r\nthis was understood by both parties, and it is probable the arrangement\r\nnever could have been completed, had not the honest countenance and\r\nmanner of Deerslayer wrought their usual effect on Rivenoak.\r\n\r\n"My brother knows I put faith in him," said the latter, as he advanced\r\nwith Hutter, whose legs had been released to enable the old man to\r\nascend to the platform. "One scalp--one more beast."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Mingo," interrupted the hunter, "keep your prisoner a moment. I\r\nhave to go and seek the means of payment."\r\n\r\nThis excuse, however, though true in part, was principally a fetch.\r\nDeerslayer left the platform, and entering the house, he directed Judith\r\nto collect all the arms and to conceal them in her own room. He then\r\nspoke earnestly to the Delaware, who stood on guard as before, near the\r\nentrance of the building, put the three remaining castles in his pocket,\r\nand returned.\r\n\r\n"You are welcome back to your old abode, Master Hutter," said\r\nDeerslayer, as he helped the other up on the platform, slyly passing\r\ninto the hand of Rivenoak, at the same time, another of the castles.\r\n"You\'ll find your darters right glad to see you, and here\'s Hetty come\r\nherself to say as much in her own behalf."\r\n\r\nHere the hunter stopped speaking and broke out into a hearty fit of his\r\nsilent and peculiar laughter. Hurry\'s legs were just released, and he\r\nhad been placed on his feet. So tightly had the ligatures been drawn,\r\nthat the use of his limbs was not immediately recovered, and the young\r\ngiant presented, in good sooth, a very helpless and a somewhat ludicrous\r\npicture. It was this unusual spectacle, particularly the bewildered\r\ncountenance, that excited the merriment of Deerslayer.\r\n\r\n"You look like a girdled pine in a clearin\', Hurry Harry, that is\r\nrocking in a gale," said Deerslayer, checking his unseasonable mirth,\r\nmore from delicacy to the others than from any respect to the liberated\r\ncaptive. "I\'m glad, howsever, to see that you haven\'t had your hair\r\ndressed by any of the Iroquois barbers, in your late visit to their\r\ncamp."\r\n\r\n"Harkee, Deerslayer," returned the other a little fiercely, "it will\r\nbe prudent for you to deal less in mirth and more in friendship on this\r\noccasion. Act like a Christian, for once, and not like a laughing gal\r\nin a country school when the master\'s back is turned, and just tell me\r\nwhether there\'s any feet, or not, at the end of these legs of mine. I\r\nthink I can see them, but as for feelin\' they might as well be down on\r\nthe banks of the Mohawk, as be where they seem to be."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come off whole, Hurry, and that\'s not a little," answered the\r\nother, secretly passing to the Indian the remainder of the stipulated\r\nransom, and making an earnest sign at the same moment for him to\r\ncommence his retreat. "You\'ve come off whole, feet and all, and are\r\nonly a little numb from a tight fit of the withes. Natur\'ll soon set the\r\nblood in motion, and then you may begin to dance, to celebrate what I\r\ncall a most wonderful and onexpected deliverance from a den of wolves."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer released the arms of his friends, as each landed, and the\r\ntwo were now stamping and limping about on the platform, growling\r\nand uttering denunciations as they endeavored to help the returning\r\ncirculation. They had been tethered too long, however, to regain the use\r\nof their limbs in a moment, and the Indians being quite as diligent on\r\ntheir return as on their advance, the raft was fully a hundred yards\r\nfrom the castle when Hurry, turning accidentally in that direction,\r\ndiscovered how fast it was getting beyond the reach of his vengeance. By\r\nthis time he could move with tolerable facility, though still numb and\r\nawkward. Without considering his own situation, however, he seized the\r\nrifle that leaned against the shoulder of Deerslayer, and attempted to\r\ncock and present it. The young hunter was too quick for him. Seizing the\r\npiece he wrenched it from the hands of the giant, not, however, until\r\nit had gone off in the struggle, when pointed directly upward. It is\r\nprobable that Deerslayer could have prevailed in such a contest, on\r\naccount of the condition of Hurry\'s limbs, but the instant the gun went\r\noff, the latter yielded, and stumped towards the house, raising his legs\r\nat each step quite a foot from the ground, from an uncertainty of the\r\nactual position of his feet. But he had been anticipated by Judith. The\r\nwhole stock of Hutter\'s arms, which had been left in the building as a\r\nresource in the event of a sudden outbreaking of hostilities, had\r\nbeen removed, and were already secreted, agreeably to Deerslayer\'s\r\ndirections. In consequence of this precaution, no means offered by which\r\nMarch could put his designs in execution.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his vengeance, Hurry seated himself, and like Hutter,\r\nfor half an hour, he was too much occupied in endeavoring to restore the\r\ncirculation, and in regaining the use of his limbs, to indulge in any\r\nother reflections. By the end of this time the raft had disappeared, and\r\nnight was beginning to throw her shadows once more over the whole sylvan\r\nscene. Before darkness had completely set in, and while the girls were\r\npreparing the evening meal, Deerslayer related to Hutter an outline of\r\nevents that had taken place, and gave him a history of the means he had\r\nadopted for the security of his children and property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "As long as Edwarde rules thys lande,\r\n    Ne quiet you wylle ye know;\r\n    Your sonnes and husbandes shall be slayne,\r\n    And brookes with bloode shall \'flowe.\'\r\n\r\n    "You leave youre geode and lawfulle kynge,\r\n    Whenne ynne adversity;\r\n    Like me, untoe the true cause stycke,\r\n    And for the true cause dye."\r\n\r\n    Chatterton.\r\n\r\nThe calm of evening was again in singular contrast, while its gathering\r\ngloom was in as singular unison with the passions of men. The sun was\r\nset, and the rays of the retiring luminary had ceased to gild the edges\r\nof the few clouds that had sufficient openings to admit the passage of\r\nits fading light. The canopy overhead was heavy and dense, promising\r\nanother night of darkness, but the surface of the lake was scarcely\r\ndisturbed by a ripple. There was a little air, though it scarce deserved\r\nto be termed wind. Still, being damp and heavy, it had a certain force.\r\nThe party in the castle were as gloomy and silent as the scene. The\r\ntwo ransomed prisoners felt humbled and discoloured, but their humility\r\npartook of the rancour of revenge. They were far more disposed to\r\nremember the indignity with which they had been treated during the last\r\nfew hours of their captivity, than to feel grateful for the previous\r\nindulgence. Then that keen-sighted monitor, conscience, by reminding\r\nthem of the retributive justice of all they had endured, goaded them\r\nrather to turn the tables on their enemies than to accuse themselves.\r\nAs for the others, they were thoughtful equally from regret and joy.\r\nDeerslayer and Judith felt most of the former sensation, though from\r\nvery different causes, while Hetty for the moment was perfectly happy.\r\nThe Delaware had also lively pictures of felicity in the prospect of\r\nso soon regaining his betrothed. Under such circumstances, and in this\r\nmood, all were taking the evening meal.\r\n\r\n"Old Tom!" cried Hurry, bursting into a fit of boisterous laughter,\r\n"you look\'d amazin\'ly like a tethered bear, as you was stretched on\r\nthem hemlock boughs, and I only wonder you didn\'t growl more. Well, it\'s\r\nover, and syth\'s and lamentations won\'t mend the matter! There\'s the\r\nblackguard Rivenoak, he that brought us off has an oncommon scalp, and\r\nI\'d give as much for it myself as the Colony. Yes, I feel as rich as the\r\ngovernor in these matters now, and will lay down with them doubloon for\r\ndoubloon. Judith, darling, did you mourn for me much, when I was in the\r\nhands of the Philipsteins?"\r\n\r\nThe last were a family of German descent on the Mohawk, to whom Hurry\r\nhad a great antipathy, and whom he had confounded with the enemies of\r\nJudea.\r\n\r\n"Our tears have raised the lake, Hurry March, as you might have seen by\r\nthe shore!" returned Judith, with a feigned levity that she was far\r\nfrom feeling. "That Hetty and I should have grieved for father was to be\r\nexpected; but we fairly rained tears for you."\r\n\r\n"We were sorry for poor Hurry, as well as for father, Judith!" put in\r\nher innocent and unconscious sister.\r\n\r\n"True, girl, true; but we feel sorrow for everybody that\'s in trouble,\r\nyou know," returned the other in a quick, admonitory manner and a low\r\ntone. "Nevertheless, we are glad to see you, Master March, and out of\r\nthe hands of the Philipsteins, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'re a bad set, and so is the other brood of \'em, down on the\r\nriver. It\'s a wonderment to me how you got us off, Deerslayer; and I\r\nforgive you the interference that prevented my doin\' justice on that\r\nvagabond, for this small service. Let us into the secret, that we may do\r\nyou the same good turn, at need. Was it by lying, or by coaxing?"\r\n\r\n"By neither, Hurry, but by buying. We paid a ransom for you both,\r\nand that, too, at a price so high you had well be on your guard ag\'in\r\nanother captyvement, lest our stock of goods shouldn\'t hold out."\r\n\r\n"A ransom! Old Tom has paid the fiddler, then, for nothing of mine would\r\nhave bought off the hair, much less the skin. I didn\'t think men as keen\r\nset as them vagabonds would let a fellow up so easy, when they had him\r\nfairly at a close hug, and floored. But money is money, and somehow it\'s\r\nunnat\'ral hard to withstand. Indian or white man, \'tis pretty much the\r\nsame. It must be owned, Judith, there\'s a considerable of human natur\'\r\nin mankind ginirally, arter all!"\r\n\r\nHutter now rose, and signing to Deerslayer, he led him to an inner room,\r\nwhere, in answer to his questions, he first learned the price that had\r\nbeen paid for his release. The old man expressed neither resentment nor\r\nsurprise at the inroad that had been made on his chest, though he\r\ndid manifest some curiosity to know how far the investigation of its\r\ncontents had been carried. He also inquired where the key had been\r\nfound. The habitual frankness of Deerslayer prevented any prevarication,\r\nand the conference soon terminated by the return of the two to the\r\nouter room, or that which served for the double purpose of parlour and\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if it\'s peace or war, between us and the savages!" exclaimed\r\nHurry, just as Deerslayer, who had paused for a single instant, listened\r\nattentively, and was passing through the outer door without stopping.\r\n"This givin\' up captives has a friendly look, and when men have traded\r\ntogether on a fair and honourable footing they ought to part fri\'nds,\r\nfor that occasion at least. Come back, Deerslayer, and let us have\r\nyour judgment, for I\'m beginnin\' to think more of you, since your late\r\nbehaviour, than I used to do."\r\n\r\n"There\'s an answer to your question, Hurry, since you\'re in such haste\r\nto come ag\'in to blows."\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer spoke, he threw on the table on which the other was\r\nreclining with one elbow a sort of miniature fagot, composed of a dozen\r\nsticks bound tightly together with a deer-skin thong. March seized it\r\neagerly, and holding it close to a blazing knot of pine that lay on\r\nthe hearth, and which gave out all the light there was in the room,\r\nascertained that the ends of the several sticks had been dipped in\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n"If this isn\'t plain English," said the reckless frontier man, "it\'s\r\nplain Indian! Here\'s what they call a dicliration of war, down at York,\r\nJudith. How did you come by this defiance, Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"Fairly enough. It lay not a minut\' since, in what you call Floatin\'\r\nTom\'s door-yard."\r\n\r\n"How came it there?"\r\n\r\n"It never fell from the clouds, Judith, as little toads sometimes do,\r\nand then it don\'t rain."\r\n\r\n"You must prove where it come from, Deerslayer, or we shall suspect some\r\ndesign to skear them that would have lost their wits long ago, if fear\r\ncould drive \'em away."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had approached a window, and cast a glance out of it on the\r\ndark aspect of the lake. As if satisfied with what he beheld, he drew\r\nnear Hurry, and took the bundle of sticks into his own hand, examining\r\nit attentively.\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is an Indian declaration of war, sure enough," he said,\r\n"and it\'s a proof how little you\'re suited to be on the path it has\r\ntravelled, Harry March, that it has got here, and you never the wiser as\r\nto the means. The savages may have left the scalp on your head, but they\r\nmust have taken off the ears; else you\'d have heard the stirring of the\r\nwater made by the lad as he come off ag\'in on his two logs. His ar\'n\'d\r\nwas to throw these sticks at our door, as much as to say, we\'ve struck\r\nthe war-post since the trade, and the next thing will be to strike you."\r\n\r\n"The prowling wolves! But hand me that rifle, Judith, and I\'ll send an\r\nanswer back to the vagabonds through their messenger."\r\n\r\n"Not while I stand by, Master March," coolly put in Deerslayer,\r\nmotioning for the other to forbear. "Faith is faith, whether given to a\r\nred-skin, or to a Christian. The lad lighted a knot, and came off fairly\r\nunder its blaze to give us this warning; and no man here should harm\r\nhim, while empl\'yed on such an ar\'n\'d. There\'s no use in words, for the\r\nboy is too cunning to leave the knot burning, now his business is done,\r\nand the night is already too dark for a rifle to have any sartainty."\r\n\r\n"That may be true enough, as to a gun, but there\'s virtue still in a\r\ncanoe," answered Hurry, passing towards the door with enormous strides,\r\ncarrying a rifle in his hands. "The being doesn\'t live that shall stop\r\nme from following and bringing back that riptyle\'s scalp. The more on\r\n\'em that you crush in the egg, the fewer there\'ll be to dart at you in\r\nthe woods!"\r\n\r\nJudith trembled like the aspen, she scarce knew why herself, though\r\nthere was the prospect of a scene of violence; for if Hurry was fierce\r\nand overbearing in the consciousness of his vast strength, Deerslayer\r\nhad about him the calm determination that promises greater perseverance,\r\nand a resolution more likely to effect its object. It was the stern,\r\nresolute eye of the latter, rather than the noisy vehemence of the\r\nfirst, that excited her apprehensions. Hurry soon reached the spot where\r\nthe canoe was fastened, but not before Deerslayer had spoken in a quick,\r\nearnest voice to the Serpent, in Delaware. The latter had been the\r\nfirst, in truth, to hear the sounds of the oars, and he had gone upon\r\nthe platform in jealous watchfulness. The light satisfied him that a\r\nmessage was coming, and when the boy cast his bundle of sticks at his\r\nfeet, it neither moved his anger nor induced surprise. He merely stood\r\nat watch, rifle in hand, to make certain that no treachery lay behind\r\nthe defiance. As Deerslayer now called to him, he stepped into the\r\ncanoe, and quick as thought removed the paddles. Hurry was furious\r\nwhen he found that he was deprived of the means of proceeding. He first\r\napproached the Indian with loud menaces, and even Deerslayer stood\r\naghast at the probable consequences. March shook his sledge-hammer fists\r\nand flourished his arms as he drew near the Indian, and all expected he\r\nwould attempt to fell the Delaware to the earth; one of them, at least,\r\nwas well aware that such an experiment would be followed by immediate\r\nbloodshed. But even Hurry was awed by the stern composure of the chief,\r\nand he, too, knew that such a man was not to be outraged with impunity;\r\nhe therefore turned to vent his rage on Deerslayer, where he foresaw no\r\nconsequences so terrible. What might have been the result of this second\r\ndemonstration if completed, is unknown, since it was never made.\r\n\r\n"Hurry," said a gentle, soothing voice at his elbow, "it\'s wicked to be\r\nso angry, and God will not overlook it. The Iroquois treated you well,\r\nand they didn\'t take your scalp, though you and father wanted to take\r\ntheirs."\r\n\r\nThe influence of mildness on passion is well known. Hetty, too, had\r\nearned a sort of consideration, that had never before been enjoyed\r\nby her, through the self-devotion and decision of her recent conduct.\r\nPerhaps her established mental imbecility, by removing all distrust of\r\na wish to control, aided her influence. Let the cause be as questionable\r\nas it might, the effect we sufficiently certain. Instead of throttling\r\nhis old fellow-traveler, Hurry turned to the girl and poured out a\r\nportion of his discontent, if none of his anger, in her attentive ears.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis too bad, Hetty!" he exclaimed; "as bad as a county gaol or a lack\r\nof beaver, to get a creatur\' into your very trap, then to see it get\r\noff. As much as six first quality skins, in valie, has paddled off on\r\nthem clumsy logs, when twenty strokes of a well-turned paddle would\r\novertake \'em. I say in valie, for as to the boy in the way of natur\', he\r\nis only a boy, and is worth neither more nor less than one. Deerslayer,\r\nyou\'ve been ontrue to your fri\'nds in letting such a chance slip through\r\nmy fingers well as your own."\r\n\r\nThe answer was given quietly, but with a voice as steady as a fearless\r\nnature and the consciousness of rectitude could make it. "I should\r\nhave been untrue to the right, had I done otherwise," returned the\r\nDeerslayer, steadily; "and neither you, nor any other man has authority\r\nto demand that much of me. The lad came on a lawful business, and the\r\nmeanest red-skin that roams the woods would be ashamed of not respecting\r\nhis ar\'n\'d. But he\'s now far beyond your reach, Master March, and\r\nthere\'s little use in talking, like a couple of women, of what can no\r\nlonger be helped."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Deerslayer turned away, like one resolved to waste no more\r\nwords on the subject, while Hutter pulled Harry by the sleeve, and led\r\nhim into the ark. There they sat long in private conference. In the\r\nmean time, the Indian and his friend had their secret consultation; for,\r\nthough it wanted some three or four hours to the rising of the star, the\r\nformer could not abstain from canvassing his scheme, and from opening\r\nhis heart to the other. Judith, too, yielded to her softer feelings,\r\nand listened to the whole of Hetty\'s artless narrative of what occurred\r\nafter she landed. The woods had few terrors for either of these girls,\r\neducated as they had been, and accustomed as they were to look out daily\r\nat their rich expanse or to wander beneath their dark shades; but the\r\nelder sister felt that she would have hesitated about thus venturing\r\nalone into an Iroquois camp. Concerning Hist, Hetty was not very\r\ncommunicative. She spoke of her kindness and gentleness and of the\r\nmeeting in the forest; but the secret of Chingachgook was guarded with\r\na shrewdness and fidelity that many a sharper-witted girl might have\r\nfailed to display.\r\n\r\nAt length the several conferences were broken up by the reappearance\r\nof Hutter on the platform. Here he assembled the whole party, and\r\ncommunicated as much of his intentions as he deemed expedient. Of the\r\narrangement made by Deerslayer, to abandon the castle during the night\r\nand to take refuge in the ark, he entirely approved. It struck him as it\r\nhad the others, as the only effectual means of escaping destruction.\r\nNow that the savages had turned their attention to the construction of\r\nrafts, no doubt could exist of their at least making an attempt to carry\r\nthe building, and the message of the bloody sticks sufficiently showed\r\ntheir confidence in their own success. In short, the old man viewed\r\nthe night as critical, and he called on all to get ready as soon as\r\npossible, in order to abandon the dwellings temporarily at least, if not\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThese communications made, everything proceeded promptly and with\r\nintelligence; the castle was secured in the manner already described,\r\nthe canoes were withdrawn from the dock and fastened to the ark by the\r\nside of the other; the few necessaries that had been left in the\r\nhouse were transferred to the cabin, the fire was extinguished and all\r\nembarked.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the hills, with their drapery of pines, had the effect\r\nto render nights that were obscure darker than common on the lake.\r\nAs usual, however, a belt of comparative light was etched through the\r\ncentre of the sheet, while it was within the shadows of the mountains\r\nthat the gloom rested most heavily on the water. The island, or castle,\r\nstood in this belt of comparative light, but still the night was so dark\r\nas to cover the aperture of the ark. At the distance of an observer on\r\nthe shore her movements could not be seen at all, more particularly as a\r\nbackground of dark hillside filled up the perspective of every view that\r\nwas taken diagonally or directly across the water. The prevailing wind\r\non the lakes of that region is west, but owing to the avenues formed by\r\nthe mountains it is frequently impossible to tell the true direction\r\nof the currents, as they often vary within short distances and brief\r\ndifferences of time. This is truer in light fluctuating puffs of air\r\nthan in steady breezes; though the squalls of even the latter are\r\nfamiliarly known to be uncertain and baffling in all mountainous regions\r\nand narrow waters. On the present occasion, Hutter himself (as he shoved\r\nthe ark from her berth at the side of the platform) was at a loss to\r\npronounce which way the wind blew. In common, this difficulty was solved\r\nby the clouds, which, floating high above the hill tops, as a matter of\r\ncourse obeyed the currents; but now the whole vault of heaven seemed\r\na mass of gloomy wall. Not an opening of any sort was visible, and\r\nChingachgook was already trembling lest the non-appearance of the star\r\nmight prevent his betrothed from being punctual to her appointment.\r\nUnder these circumstances, Hutter hoisted his sail, seemingly with the\r\nsole intention of getting away from the castle, as it might be dangerous\r\nto remain much longer in its vicinity. The air soon filled the cloth,\r\nand when the scow was got under command, and the sail was properly\r\ntrimmed, it was found that the direction was southerly, inclining\r\ntowards the eastern shore. No better course offering for the purposes\r\nof the party, the singular craft was suffered to skim the surface of\r\nthe water in this direction for more than hour, when a change in the\r\ncurrents of the air drove them over towards the camp.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer watched all the movements of Hutter and Harry with jealous\r\nattention. At first, he did not know whether to ascribe the course they\r\nheld to accident or to design; but he now began to suspect the latter.\r\nFamiliar as Hutter was with the lake, it was easy to deceive one who had\r\nlittle practice on the water; and let his intentions be what they\r\nmight, it was evident, ere two hours had elapsed, that the ark had got\r\nsufficient space to be within a hundred rods of the shore, directly\r\nabreast of the known position of the camp. For a considerable time\r\npreviously to reaching this point, Hurry, who had some knowledge of the\r\nAlgonquin language, had been in close conference with the Indian, and\r\nthe result was now announced by the latter to Deerslayer, who had been a\r\ncold, not to say distrusted, looker-on of all that passed.\r\n\r\n"My old father, and my young brother, the Big Pine,"--for so the\r\nDelaware had named March--"want to see Huron scalps at their belts,"\r\nsaid Chingachgook to his friend. "There is room for some on the girdle\r\nof the Sarpent, and his people will look for them when he goes back to\r\nhis village. Their eyes must not be left long in a fog, but they must\r\nsee what they look for. I know that my brother has a white hand; he will\r\nnot strike even the dead. He will wait for us; when we come back, he\r\nwill not hide his face from shame for his friend. The great Serpent of\r\nthe Mohicans must be worthy to go on the war-path with Hawkeye."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, Sarpent, I see how it is; that name\'s to stick, and in time I\r\nshall get to be known by it instead of Deerslayer; well, if such honours\r\nwill come, the humblest of us all must be willing to abide by \'em. As\r\nfor your looking for scalps, it belongs to your gifts, and I see no harm\r\nin it. Be marciful, Sarpent, howsever; be marciful, I beseech of you. It\r\nsurely can do no harm to a red-skin\'s honour to show a little marcy. As\r\nfor the old man, the father of two young women, who might ripen better\r\nfeelin\'s in his heart, and Harry March, here, who, pine as he is, might\r\nbetter bear the fruit of a more Christianized tree, as for them two, I\r\nleave them in the hands of the white man\'s God. Wasn\'t it for the bloody\r\nsticks, no man should go ag\'in the Mingos this night, seein\' that it\r\nwould dishonor our faith and characters; but them that crave blood can\'t\r\ncomplain if blood is shed at their call. Still, Sarpent, you can be\r\nmarciful. Don\'t begin your career with the wails of women and the cries\r\nof children. Bear yourself so that Hist will smile, and not weep, when\r\nshe meets you. Go, then; and the Manitou presarve you!"\r\n\r\n"My brother will stay here with the scow. Wah will soon be standing on\r\nthe shore waiting, and Chingachgook must hasten."\r\n\r\nThe Indian then joined his two co-adventurers, and first lowering the\r\nsail, they all three entered the canoe, and left the side of the ark.\r\nNeither Hutter nor March spoke to Deerslayer concerning their object, or\r\nthe probable length of their absence. All this had been confided to\r\nthe Indian, who had acquitted himself of the trust with characteristic\r\nbrevity. As soon as the canoe was out of sight, and that occurred\r\nere the paddles had given a dozen strokes, Deerslayer made the best\r\ndispositions he could to keep the ark as nearly stationary as possible;\r\nand then he sat down in the end of the scow, to chew the cud of his own\r\nbitter reflections. It was not long, however, before he was joined by\r\nJudith, who sought every occasion to be near him, managing her attack on\r\nhis affections with the address that was suggested by native coquetry,\r\naided by no little practice, but which received much of its most\r\ndangerous power from the touch of feeling that threw around her manner,\r\nvoice, accents, thoughts, and acts, the indescribable witchery of\r\nnatural tenderness. Leaving the young hunter exposed to these dangerous\r\nassailants, it has become our more immediate business to follow the\r\nparty in the canoe to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe controlling influence that led Hutter and Hurry to repeat their\r\nexperiment against the camp was precisely that which had induced the\r\nfirst attempt, a little heightened, perhaps, by the desire of revenge.\r\nBut neither of these two rude beings, so ruthless in all things that\r\ntouched the rights and interests of the red man, thought possessing\r\nveins of human feeling on other matters, was much actuated by any other\r\ndesire than a heartless longing for profit. Hurry had felt angered at\r\nhis sufferings, when first liberated, it is true, but that emotion\r\nsoon disappeared in the habitual love of gold, which he sought with the\r\nreckless avidity of a needy spendthrift, rather than with the ceaseless\r\nlongings of a miser. In short, the motive that urged them both so soon\r\nto go against the Hurons, was an habitual contempt of their enemy,\r\nacting on the unceasing cupidity of prodigality. The additional chances\r\nof success, however, had their place in the formation of the second\r\nenterprise. It was known that a large portion of the warriors--perhaps\r\nall--were encamped for the night abreast of the castle, and it was hoped\r\nthat the scalps of helpless victims would be the consequence. To confess\r\nthe truth, Hutter in particular--he who had just left two daughters\r\nbehind him--expected to find few besides women and children in the camp.\r\nThe fact had been but slightly alluded to in his communications with\r\nHurry, and with Chingachgook it had been kept entirely out of view. If\r\nthe Indian thought of it at all, it was known only to himself.\r\n\r\nHutter steered the canoe; Hurry had manfully taken his post in the bows,\r\nand Chingachgook stood in the centre. We say stood, for all three were\r\nso skilled in the management of that species of frail bark, as to be\r\nable to keep erect positions in the midst of the darkness. The approach\r\nto the shore was made with great caution, and the landing effected in\r\nsafety. The three now prepared their arms, and began their tiger-like\r\napproach upon the camp. The Indian was on the lead, his two companions\r\ntreading in his footsteps with a stealthy cautiousness of manner that\r\nrendered their progress almost literally noiseless. Occasionally a\r\ndried twig snapped under the heavy weight of the gigantic Hurry, or the\r\nblundering clumsiness of the old man; but, had the Indian walked on air,\r\nhis step could not have seemed lighter. The great object was first to\r\ndiscover the position of the fire, which was known to be the centre of\r\nthe whole encampment. At length the keen eye of Chingachgook caught a\r\nglimpse of this important guide. It was glimmering at a distance among\r\nthe trunks of trees. There was no blaze, but merely a single smouldering\r\nbrand, as suited the hour; the savages usually retiring and rising with\r\nthe revolutions of the sun.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a view was obtained of this beacon, the progress of the\r\nadventurers became swifter and more certain. In a few minutes they got\r\nto the edge of the circle of little huts. Here they stopped to survey\r\ntheir ground, and to concert their movements. The darkness was so deep\r\nas to render it difficult to distinguish anything but the glowing brand,\r\nthe trunks of the nearest trees, and the endless canopy of leaves that\r\nveiled the clouded heaven. It was ascertained, however, that a hut was\r\nquite near, and Chingachgook attempted to reconnnoitre its interior.\r\nThe manner in which the Indian approached the place that was supposed to\r\ncontain enemies, resembled the wily advances of the cat on the bird. As\r\nhe drew near, he stooped to his hands and knees, for the entrance was so\r\nlow as to require this attitude, even as a convenience. Before trusting\r\nhis head inside, however, he listened long to catch the breathing of\r\nsleepers. No sound was audible, and this human Serpent thrust his head\r\nin at the door, or opening, as another serpent would have peered in on\r\nthe nest. Nothing rewarded the hazardous experiment; for, after feeling\r\ncautiously with a hand, the place was found to be empty.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware proceeded in the same guarded manner to one or two more\r\nof the huts, finding all in the same situation. He then returned to his\r\ncompanions, and informed them that the Hurons had deserted their camp.\r\nA little further inquiry corroborated this fact, and it only remained to\r\nreturn to the canoe. The different manner in which the adventurers bore\r\nthe disappointment is worthy of a passing remark. The chief, who had\r\nlanded solely with the hope of acquiring renown, stood stationary,\r\nleaning against a tree, waiting the pleasure of his companions. He was\r\nmortified, and a little surprised, it is true; but he bore all with\r\ndignity, falling back for support on the sweeter expectations that still\r\nlay in reserve for that evening. It was true, he could not now hope to\r\nmeet his mistress with the proofs of his daring and skill on his person,\r\nbut he might still hope to meet her; and the warrior, who was zealous in\r\nthe search, might always hope to be honored. On the other hand, Hutter\r\nand Hurry, who had been chiefly instigated by the basest of all human\r\nmotives, the thirst of gain, could scarce control their feelings. They\r\nwent prowling among the huts, as if they expected to find some forgotten\r\nchild or careless sleeper; and again and again did they vent their spite\r\non the insensible huts, several of which were actually torn to pieces,\r\nand scattered about the place. Nay, they even quarrelled with each\r\nother, and fierce reproaches passed between them. It is possible\r\nsome serious consequences might have occurred, had not the Delaware\r\ninterfered to remind them of the danger of being so unguarded, and of\r\nthe necessity of returning to the ark. This checked the dispute, and in\r\na few minutes they were paddling sullenly back to the spot where they\r\nhoped to find that vessel.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Judith took her place at the side of Deerslayer,\r\nsoon after the adventurers departed. For a short time the girl was\r\nsilent, and the hunter was ignorant which of the sisters had approached\r\nhim, but he soon recognized the rich, full-spirited voice of the elder,\r\nas her feelings escaped in words.\r\n\r\n"This is a terrible life for women, Deerslayer!" she exclaimed. "Would\r\nto Heaven I could see an end of it!"\r\n\r\n"The life is well enough, Judith," was the answer, "being pretty much as\r\nit is used or abused. What would you wish to see in its place?"\r\n\r\n"I should be a thousand times happier to live nearer to civilized\r\nbeings--where there are farms and churches, and houses built as it might\r\nbe by Christian hands; and where my sleep at night would be sweet and\r\ntranquil! A dwelling near one of the forts would be far better than this\r\ndreary place where we live!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Judith, I can\'t agree too lightly in the truth of all this. If\r\nforts are good to keep off inimies, they sometimes hold inimies of their\r\nown. I don\'t think \'twould be for your good, or the good of Hetty, to\r\nlive near one; and if I must say what I think, I\'m afeard you are\r\na little too near as it is." Deerslayer went on, in his own steady,\r\nearnest manner, for the darkness concealed the tints that colored the\r\ncheeks of the girl almost to the brightness of crimson, while her own\r\ngreat efforts suppressed the sounds of the breathing that nearly choked\r\nher. "As for farms, they have their uses, and there\'s them that like\r\nto pass their lives on \'em; but what comfort can a man look for in a\r\nclearin\', that he can\'t find in double quantities in the forest? If air,\r\nand room, and light, are a little craved, the windrows and the streams\r\nwill furnish \'em, or here are the lakes for such as have bigger longings\r\nin that way; but where are you to find your shades, and laughing\r\nsprings, and leaping brooks, and vinerable trees, a thousand years old,\r\nin a clearin\'? You don\'t find them, but you find their disabled trunks,\r\nmarking the \'arth like headstones in a graveyard. It seems to me that\r\nthe people who live in such places must be always thinkin\' of their own\r\ninds, and of universal decay; and that, too, not of the decay that is\r\nbrought about by time and natur\', but the decay that follows waste and\r\nviolence. Then as to churches, they are good, I suppose, else wouldn\'t\r\ngood men uphold \'em. But they are not altogether necessary. They call\r\n\'em the temples of the Lord; but, Judith, the whole \'arth is a temple of\r\nthe Lord to such as have the right mind. Neither forts nor churches\r\nmake people happier of themselves. Moreover, all is contradiction in\r\nthe settlements, while all is concord in the woods. Forts and churches\r\nalmost always go together, and yet they\'re downright contradictions;\r\nchurches being for peace, and forts for war. No, no--give me the strong\r\nplaces of the wilderness, which is the trees, and the churches, too,\r\nwhich are arbors raised by the hand of natur\'."\r\n\r\n"Woman is not made for scenes like these, Deerslayer, scenes of which we\r\nshall have no end, as long as this war lasts."\r\n\r\n"If you mean women of white colour, I rather think you\'re not far from\r\nthe truth, gal; but as for the females of the redmen, such visitations\r\nare quite in character. Nothing would make Hist, now, the bargained\r\nwife of yonder Delaware, happier than to know that he is at this moment\r\nprowling around his nat\'ral inimies, striving after a scalp."\r\n\r\n"Surely, surely, Deerslayer, she cannot be a woman, and not feel concern\r\nwhen she thinks the man she loves is in danger!"\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t think of the danger, Judith, but of the honor; and when the\r\nheart is desperately set on such feelin\'s, why, there is little room to\r\ncrowd in fear. Hist is a kind, gentle, laughing, pleasant creatur\', but\r\nshe loves honor, as well as any Delaware gal I ever know\'d. She\'s to\r\nmeet the Sarpent an hour hence, on the p\'int where Hetty landed, and no\r\ndoubt she has her anxiety about it, like any other woman; but she\'d be\r\nall the happier did she know that her lover was at this moment waylaying\r\na Mingo for his scalp."\r\n\r\n"If you really believe this, Deerslayer, no wonder you lay so much\r\nstress on gifts. Certain am I, that no white girl could feel anything\r\nbut misery while she believed her betrothed in danger of his life! Nor\r\ndo I suppose even you, unmoved and calm as you ever seem to be, could be\r\nat peace if you believed your Hist in danger."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a different matter--\'tis altogether a different matter, Judith.\r\nWoman is too weak and gentle to be intended to run such risks, and man\r\nmust feel for her. Yes, I rather think that\'s as much red natur\' as it\'s\r\nwhite. But I have no Hist, nor am I like to have; for I hold it wrong to\r\nmix colours, any way except in friendship and sarvices."\r\n\r\n"In that you are and feel as a white man should! As for Hurry Harry, I\r\ndo think it would be all the same to him whether his wife were a squaw\r\nor a governor\'s daughter, provided she was a little comely, and could\r\nhelp to keep his craving stomach full."\r\n\r\n"You do March injustice, Judith; yes, you do. The poor fellow dotes\r\non you, and when a man has ra\'ally set his heart on such a creatur\' it\r\nisn\'t a Mingo, or even a Delaware gal, that\'ll be likely to unsettle\r\nhis mind. You may laugh at such men as Hurry and I, for we\'re rough and\r\nunteached in the ways of books and other knowledge; but we\'ve our good\r\np\'ints, as well as our bad ones. An honest heart is not to be despised,\r\ngal, even though it be not varsed in all the niceties that please the\r\nfemale fancy."\r\n\r\n"You, Deerslayer! And do you--can you, for an instant, suppose I place\r\nyou by the side of Harry March? No, no, I am not so far gone in dullness\r\nas that. No one--man or woman--could think of naming your honest heart,\r\nmanly nature, and simple truth, with the boisterous selfishness, greedy\r\navarice, and overbearing ferocity of Harry March. The very best that can\r\nbe said of him, is to be found in his name of Hurry Skurry, which, if it\r\nmeans no great harm, means no great good. Even my father, following his\r\nfeelings with the other, as he is doing at this moment, well knows the\r\ndifference between you. This I know, for he said as much to me, in plain\r\nlanguage."\r\n\r\nJudith was a girl of quick sensibilities and of impetuous feelings; and,\r\nbeing under few of the restraints that curtail the manifestations of\r\nmaiden emotions among those who are educated in the habits of civilized\r\nlife, she sometimes betrayed the latter with a feeling that was so\r\npurely natural as to place it as far above the wiles of coquetry as it\r\nwas superior to its heartlessness. She had now even taken one of the\r\nhard hands of the hunter and pressed it between both her own, with a\r\nwarmth and earnestness that proved how sincere was her language. It\r\nwas perhaps fortunate that she was checked by the very excess of her\r\nfeelings, since the same power might have urged her on to avow all that\r\nher father had said--the old man not having been satisfied with making a\r\ncomparison favorable to Deerslayer, as between the hunter and Hurry, but\r\nhaving actually, in his blunt rough way, briefly advised his daughter to\r\ncast off the latter entirely, and to think of the former as a husband.\r\nJudith would not willingly have said this to any other man, but\r\nthere was so much confidence awakened by the guileless simplicity of\r\nDeerslayer, that one of her nature found it a constant temptation to\r\noverstep the bounds of habit. She went no further, however, immediately\r\nrelinquishing the hand, and falling back on a reserve that was more\r\nsuited to her sex, and, indeed, to her natural modesty.\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Judith, thankee with all my heart," returned the hunter, whose\r\nhumility prevented him from placing any flattering interpretation on\r\neither the conduct or the language of the girl. "Thankee as much as if\r\nit was all true. Harry\'s sightly--yes, he\'s as sightly as the tallest\r\npine of the mountains, and the Sarpent has named him accordingly;\r\nhowever, some fancy good looks, and some fancy good conduct, only. Hurry\r\nhas one advantage, and it depends on himself whether he\'ll have t\'other\r\nor--Hark! That\'s your father\'s voice, gal, and he speaks like a man\r\nwho\'s riled at something."\r\n\r\n"God save us from any more of these horrible scenes!" exclaimed Judith,\r\nbending her face to her knees, and endeavoring to exclude the discordant\r\nsounds, by applying her hands to her ears. "I sometimes wish I had no\r\nfather!"\r\n\r\nThis was bitterly said, and the repinings which extorted the words were\r\nbitterly felt. It is impossible to say what might next have escaped her\r\nhad not a gentle, low voice spoken at her elbow.\r\n\r\n"Judith, I ought to have read a chapter to father and Hurry!" said the\r\ninnocent but terrified speaker, "and that would have kept them from\r\ngoing again on such an errand. Do you call to them, Deerslayer, and\r\ntell them I want them, and that it will be good for them both if they\'ll\r\nreturn and hearken to my words."\r\n\r\n"Ah\'s me! Poor Hetty, you little know the cravin\'s for gold and revenge,\r\nif you believe they are so easily turned aside from their longin\'s! But\r\nthis is an uncommon business in more ways than one, Judith. I hear your\r\nfather and Hurry growling like bears, and yet no noise comes from the\r\nmouth of the young chief. There\'s an ind of secrecy, and yet his\r\nwhoop, which ought to ring in the mountains, accordin\' to rule in such\r\nsarcumstances, is silent!"\r\n\r\n"Justice may have alighted on him, and his death have saved the lives of\r\nthe innocent."\r\n\r\n"Not it--not it--the Sarpent is not the one to suffer if that\'s to be\r\nthe law. Sartainly there has been no onset, and \'tis most likely that\r\nthe camp\'s deserted, and the men are comin\' back disapp\'inted. That\r\naccounts for the growls of Hurry and the silence of the Sarpent."\r\n\r\nJust at this instant a fall of a paddle was heard in the canoe, for\r\nvexation made March reckless. Deerslayer felt convinced that his\r\nconjecture was true. The sail being down, the ark had not drifted\r\nfar; and ere many minutes he heard Chingachgook, in a low, quiet tone,\r\ndirecting Hutter how to steer in order to reach it. In less time than it\r\ntakes to tell the fact, the canoe touched the scow, and the adventurers\r\nentered the latter. Neither Hutter nor Hurry spoke of what had occurred.\r\nBut the Delaware, in passing his friend, merely uttered the words\r\n"fire\'s out," which, if not literally true, sufficiently explained the\r\ntruth to his listener.\r\n\r\nIt was now a question as to the course to be steered. A short surly\r\nconference was held, when Hutter decided that the wisest way would be\r\nto keep in motion as the means most likely to defeat any attempt at a\r\nsurprise--announcing his own and March\'s intention to requite themselves\r\nfor the loss of sleep during their captivity, by lying down. As the air\r\nstill baffled and continued light, it was finally determined to sail\r\nbefore it, let it come in what direction it might, so long as it did not\r\nblow the ark upon the strand. This point settled, the released prisoners\r\nhelped to hoist the sail, and they threw themselves upon two of the\r\npallets, leaving Deerslayer and his friend to look after the movements\r\nof the craft. As neither of the latter was disposed to sleep, on account\r\nof the appointment with Hist, this arrangement was acceptable to all\r\nparties. That Judith and Hetty remained up also, in no manner impaired\r\nthe agreeable features of this change.\r\n\r\nFor some time the scow rather drifted than sailed along the western\r\nshore, following a light southerly current of the air. The progress\r\nwas slow--not exceeding a couple of miles in the hour--but the two men\r\nperceived that it was not only carrying them towards the point they\r\ndesired to reach, but at a rate that was quite as fast as the hour\r\nyet rendered necessary. But little more was said the while even by the\r\ngirls; and that little had more reference to the rescue of Hist than to\r\nany other subject. The Indian was calm to the eye, but as minute after\r\nminute passed, his feelings became more and more excited, until they\r\nreached a state that might have satisfied the demands of even the most\r\nexacting mistress. Deerslayer kept the craft as much in the bays as was\r\nprudent, for the double purpose of sailing within the shadows of the\r\nwoods, and of detecting any signs of an encampment they might pass on\r\nthe shore. In this manner they doubled one low point, and were already\r\nin the bay that was terminated north by the goal at which they aimed.\r\nThe latter was still a quarter of a mile distant, when Chingachgook\r\ncame silently to the side of his friend and pointed to a place directly\r\nahead. A small fire was glimmering just within the verge of the bushes\r\nthat lined the shore on the southern side of the point--leaving no doubt\r\nthat the Indians had suddenly removed their camp to the very place,\r\nor at least the very projection of land where Hist had given them the\r\nrendezvous!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n    "I hear thee babbling to the vale\r\n    Of sunshine and of flowers,\r\n    But unto me thou bring\'st a tale\r\n    Of visionary hours."\r\n\r\n    Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nOne discovery mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter was of\r\ngreat moment in the eyes of Deerslayer and his friend. In the first\r\nplace, there was the danger, almost the certainty, that Hutter and Hurry\r\nwould make a fresh attempt on this camp, should they awake and ascertain\r\nits position. Then there was the increased risk of landing to bring off\r\nHist; and there were the general uncertainty and additional hazards that\r\nmust follow from the circumstance that their enemies had begun to change\r\ntheir positions. As the Delaware was aware that the hour was near when\r\nhe ought to repair to the rendezvous, he no longer thought of trophies\r\ntorn from his foes, and one of the first things arranged between him and\r\nhis associate was to permit the two others to sleep on, lest they should\r\ndisturb the execution of their plans by substituting some of their own.\r\nThe ark moved slowly, and it would have taken fully a quarter of an hour\r\nto reach the point, at the rate at which they were going, thus affording\r\ntime for a little forethought. The Indians, in the wish to conceal their\r\nfire from those who were thought to be still in the castle, had placed\r\nit so near the southern side of the point as to render it extremely\r\ndifficult to shut it in by the bushes, though Deerslayer varied the\r\ndirection of the scow both to the right and to the left, in the hope of\r\nbeing able to effect that object.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one advantage, Judith, in finding that fire so near the water,"\r\nhe said, while executing these little manoeuvres, "since it shows\r\nthe Mingos believe we are in the hut, and our coming on \'em from this\r\nquarter will be an unlooked for event. But it\'s lucky Harry March and\r\nyour father are asleep, else we should have \'em prowling after scalps\r\nag\'in. Ha! there--the bushes are beginning to shut in the fire--and now\r\nit can\'t be seen at all!"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer waited a little to make certain that he had at last\r\ngained the desired position, when he gave the signal agreed on, and\r\nChingachgook let go the grapnel and lowered the sail.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which the ark now lay had its advantages and its\r\ndisadvantages. The fire had been hid by sheering towards the shore, and\r\nthe latter was nearer, perhaps, than was desirable. Still, the water\r\nwas known to be very deep further off in the lake, and anchoring in deep\r\nwater, under the circumstances in which the party was placed, was to\r\nbe avoided, if possible. It was also believed no raft could be within\r\nmiles; and though the trees in the darkness appeared almost to overhang\r\nthe scow, it would not be easy to get off to her without using a boat.\r\nThe intense darkness that prevailed so close in with the forest, too,\r\nserved as an effectual screen, and so long as care was had not to make a\r\nnoise, there was little or no danger of being detected. All these things\r\nDeerslayer pointed out to Judith, instructing her as to the course she\r\nwas to follow in the event of an alarm; for it was thought to the last\r\ndegree inexpedient to arouse the sleepers, unless it might be in the\r\ngreatest emergency.\r\n\r\n"And now, Judith, as we understand one another, it is time the Sarpent\r\nand I had taken to the canoe," the hunter concluded. "The star has not\r\nrisen yet, it\'s true, but it soon must, though none of us are likely\r\nto be any the wiser for it to-night, on account of the clouds. Howsever,\r\nHist has a ready mind, and she\'s one of them that doesn\'t always need to\r\nhave a thing afore her, to see it. I\'ll warrant you she\'ll not be either\r\ntwo minutes or two feet out of the way, unless them jealous vagabonds,\r\nthe Mingos, have taken the alarm, and put her as a stool-pigeon to\r\ncatch us, or have hid her away, in order to prepare her mind for a Huron\r\ninstead of a Mohican husband."\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer," interrupted the girl, earnestly; "this is a most dangerous\r\nservice; why do you go on it, at all?"\r\n\r\n"Anan!--Why you know, gal, we go to bring off Hist, the Sarpent\'s\r\nbetrothed--the maid he means to marry, as soon as we get back to the\r\ntribe."\r\n\r\n"That is all right for the Indian--but you do not mean to marry\r\nHist--you are not betrothed, and why should two risk their lives and\r\nliberties, to do that which one can just as well perform?"\r\n\r\n"Ah--now I understand you, Judith--yes, now I begin to take the idee.\r\nYou think as Hist is the Sarpent\'s betrothed, as they call it, and not\r\nmine, it\'s altogether his affair; and as one man can paddle a canoe he\r\nought to be left to go after his gal alone! But you forget this is our\r\nar\'n\'d here on the lake, and it would not tell well to forget an ar\'n\'d\r\njust as the pinch came. Then, if love does count for so much with some\r\npeople, particularly with young women, fri\'ndship counts for something,\r\ntoo, with other some. I dares to say, the Delaware can paddle a canoe\r\nby himself, and can bring off Hist by himself, and perhaps he would like\r\nthat quite as well, as to have me with him; but he couldn\'t sarcumvent\r\nsarcumventions, or stir up an ambushment, or fight with the savages, and\r\nget his sweetheart at the same time, as well by himself as if he had\r\na fri\'nd with him to depend on, even if that fri\'nd is no better than\r\nmyself. No--no--Judith, you wouldn\'t desert one that counted on you, at\r\nsuch a moment, and you can\'t, in reason, expect me to do it."\r\n\r\n"I fear--I believe you are right, Deerslayer, and yet I wish you were\r\nnot to go! Promise me one thing, at least, and that is, not to trust\r\nyourself among the savages, or to do anything more than to save the\r\ngirl. That will be enough for once, and with that you ought to be\r\nsatisfied."\r\n\r\n"Lord bless you! gal; one would think it was Hetty that\'s talking, and\r\nnot the quick-witted and wonderful Judith Hutter! But fright makes the\r\nwise silly, and the strong weak. Yes, I\'ve seen proofs of that, time\r\nand ag\'in! Well, it\'s kind and softhearted in you, Judith, to feel this\r\nconsarn for a fellow creatur\', and I shall always say that you are kind\r\nand of true feelings, let them that envy your good looks tell as many\r\nidle stories of you as they may."\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer!" hastily said the girl, interrupting him, though nearly\r\nchoked by her own emotions; "do you believe all you hear about a poor,\r\nmotherless girl? Is the foul tongue of Hurry Harry to blast my life?"\r\n\r\n"Not it, Judith--not it. I\'ve told Hurry it wasn\'t manful to backbite\r\nthem he couldn\'t win by fair means; and that even an Indian is always\r\ntender, touching a young woman\'s good name."\r\n\r\n"If I had a brother, he wouldn\'t dare to do it!" exclaimed Judith, with\r\neyes flashing fire. "But, finding me without any protector but an old\r\nman, whose ears are getting to be as dull as his feelings, he has his\r\nway as he pleases!"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly that, Judith; no, not exactly that, neither! No man,\r\nbrother or stranger, would stand by and see as fair a gal as yourself\r\nhunted down, without saying a word in her behalf. Hurry\'s in \'arnest in\r\nwanting to make you his wife, and the little he does let out ag\'in you,\r\ncomes more from jealousy, like, than from any thing else. Smile on him\r\nwhen he awakes, and squeeze his hand only half as hard as you squeezed\r\nmine a bit ago, and my life on it, the poor fellow will forget every\r\nthing but your comeliness. Hot words don\'t always come from the heart,\r\nbut oftener from the stomach than anywhere else. Try him, Judith, when\r\nhe awakes, and see the virtue of a smile."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer laughed, in his own manner, as he concluded, and then he\r\nintimated to the patient-looking, but really impatient Chingachgook, his\r\nreadiness to proceed. As the young man entered the canoe, the girl stood\r\nimmovable as stone, lost in the musings that the language and manner\r\nof the other were likely to produce. The simplicity of the hunter had\r\ncompletely put her at fault; for, in her narrow sphere, Judith was an\r\nexpert manager of the other sex; though in the present instance she was\r\nfar more actuated by impulses, in all she had said and done, than by\r\ncalculation. We shall not deny that some of Judith\'s reflections were\r\nbitter, though the sequel of the tale must be referred to, in order to\r\nexplain how merited, or how keen were her sufferings.\r\n\r\nChingachgook and his pale-face friend set forth on their hazardous and\r\ndelicate enterprise, with a coolness and method that would have done\r\ncredit to men who were on their twentieth, instead of being on their\r\nfirst, war-path. As suited his relation to the pretty fugitive, in whose\r\nservice they were engaged, the Indian took his place in the head of\r\nthe canoe; while Deerslayer guided its movements in the stern. By this\r\narrangement, the former would be the first to land, and of course,\r\nthe first to meet his mistress. The latter had taken his post without\r\ncomment, but in secret influenced by the reflection that one who had so\r\nmuch at stake as the Indian, might not possibly guide the canoe with the\r\nsame steadiness and intelligence, as another who had more command of his\r\nfeelings. From the instant they left the side of the ark, the movements\r\nof the two adventurers were like the manoeuvres of highly-drilled\r\nsoldiers, who, for the first time were called on to meet the enemy in\r\nthe field. As yet, Chingachgook had never fired a shot in anger, and the\r\ndebut of his companion in warfare is known to the reader. It is true,\r\nthe Indian had been hanging about his enemy\'s camp for a few hours, on\r\nhis first arrival, and he had even once entered it, as related in the\r\nlast chapter, but no consequences had followed either experiment.\r\nNow, it was certain that an important result was to be effected, or a\r\nmortifying failure was to ensue. The rescue, or the continued captivity\r\nof Hist, depended on the enterprise. In a word, it was virtually the\r\nmaiden expedition of these two ambitious young forest soldiers; and\r\nwhile one of them set forth impelled by sentiments that usually carry\r\nmen so far, both had all their feelings of pride and manhood enlisted in\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nInstead of steering in a direct line to the point, then distant from the\r\nark less than a quarter of a mile, Deerslayer laid the head of his\r\ncanoe diagonally towards the centre of the lake, with a view to obtain\r\na position from which he might approach the shore, having his enemies\r\nin his front only. The spot where Hetty had landed, and where Hist had\r\npromised to meet them, moreover, was on the upper side of the projection\r\nrather than on the lower; and to reach it would have required the two\r\nadventurers to double nearly the whole point, close in with the shore,\r\nhad not this preliminary step been taken. So well was the necessity for\r\nthis measure understood, that Chingachgook quietly paddled on, although\r\nit was adopted without consulting him, and apparently was taking him in\r\na direction nearly opposite to that one might think he most wished to\r\ngo. A few minutes sufficed, however, to carry the canoe the necessary\r\ndistance, when both the young men ceased paddling as it were by\r\ninstinctive consent, and the boat became stationary. The darkness\r\nincreased rather than diminished, but it was still possible, from the\r\nplace where the adventurers lay, to distinguish the outlines of the\r\nmountains. In vain did the Delaware turn his head eastward, to catch a\r\nglimpse of the promised star; for, notwithstanding the clouds broke\r\na little near the horizon in that quarter of the heavens, the curtain\r\ncontinued so far drawn as effectually to conceal all behind it. In\r\nfront, as was known by the formation of land above and behind it, lay\r\nthe point, at the distance of about a thousand feet. No signs of the\r\ncastle could be seen, nor could any movement in that quarter of the lake\r\nreach the ear. The latter circumstance might have been equally owing to\r\nthe distance, which was several miles, or to the fact that nothing was\r\nin motion. As for the ark, though scarcely farther from the canoe than\r\nthe point, it lay so completely buried in the shadows of the shore, that\r\nit would not have been visible even had there been many degrees more of\r\nlight than actually existed.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers now held a conference in low voices, consulting together\r\nas to the probable time. Deerslayer thought it wanted yet some minutes\r\nto the rising of the star, while the impatience of the chief caused him\r\nto fancy the night further advanced, and to believe that his betrothed\r\nwas already waiting his appearance on the shore. As might have been\r\nexpected, the opinion of the latter prevailed, and his friend disposed\r\nhimself to steer for the place of rendezvous. The utmost skill and\r\nprecaution now became necessary in the management of the canoe. The\r\npaddles were lifted and returned to the water in a noiseless manner;\r\nand when within a hundred yards of the beach, Chingachgook took in his,\r\naltogether laying his hand on his rifle in its stead. As they got still\r\nmore within the belt of darkness that girded the woods, it was seen\r\nthat they were steering too far north, and the course was altered\r\naccordingly. The canoe now seemed to move by instinct, so cautious and\r\ndeliberate were all its motions. Still it continued to advance, until\r\nits bows grated on the gravel of the beach, at the precise spot where\r\nHetty had landed, and whence her voice had issued, the previous night,\r\nas the ark was passing. There was, as usual, a narrow strand, but bushes\r\nfringed the woods, and in most places overhung the water.\r\n\r\nChingachgook stepped upon the beach, and cautiously examined it for some\r\ndistance on each side of the canoe. In order to do this, he was often\r\nobliged to wade to his knees in the lake, but no Hist rewarded his\r\nsearch. When he returned, he found his friend also on the shore. They\r\nnext conferred in whispers, the Indian apprehending that they must have\r\nmistaken the place of rendezvous. But Deerslayer thought it was probable\r\nthey had mistaken the hour. While he was yet speaking, he grasped the\r\narm of the Delaware, caused him to turn his head in the direction of\r\nthe lake, and pointed towards the summits of the eastern mountains.\r\nThe clouds had broken a little, apparently behind rather than above the\r\nhills, and the evening star was glittering among the branches of a pine.\r\nThis was every way a flattering omen, and the young men leaned on their\r\nrifles, listening intently for the sound of approaching footsteps.\r\nVoices they often heard, and mingled with them were the suppressed cries\r\nof children, and the low but sweet laugh of Indian women. As the\r\nnative Americans are habitually cautious, and seldom break out in loud\r\nconversation, the adventurers knew by these facts that they must be\r\nvery near the encampment. It was easy to perceive that there was a fire\r\nwithin the woods, by the manner in which some of the upper branches of\r\nthe trees were illuminated, but it was not possible, where they stood,\r\nto ascertain exactly how near it was to themselves. Once or twice, it\r\nseemed as if stragglers from around the fire were approaching the place\r\nof rendezvous; but these sounds were either altogether illusion, or\r\nthose who had drawn near returned again without coming to the shore. A\r\nquarter of an hour was passed in this state of intense expectation and\r\nanxiety, when Deerslayer proposed that they should circle the point in\r\nthe canoe; and by getting a position close in, where the camp could be\r\nseen, reconnoitre the Indians, and thus enable themselves to form some\r\nplausible conjectures for the non-appearance of Hist. The Delaware,\r\nhowever, resolutely refused to quit the spot, reasonably enough offering\r\nas a reason the disappointment of the girl, should she arrive in his\r\nabsence. Deerslayer felt for his friend\'s concern, and offered to make\r\nthe circuit of the point by himself, leaving the latter concealed in the\r\nbushes to await the occurrence of any fortunate event that might favour\r\nhis views. With this understanding, then, the parties separated.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Deerslayer was at his post again, in the stern of the canoe,\r\nhe left the shore with the same precautions, and in the same noiseless\r\nmanner, as he had approached it. On this occasion he did not go far from\r\nthe land, the bushes affording a sufficient cover, by keeping as close\r\nin as possible. Indeed, it would not have been easy to devise any means\r\nmore favourable to reconnoitering round an Indian camp, than those\r\nafforded by the actual state of things. The formation of the point\r\npermitted the place to be circled on three of its sides, and the\r\nprogress of the boat was so noiseless as to remove any apprehensions\r\nfrom an alarm through sound. The most practised and guarded foot might\r\nstir a bunch of leaves, or snap a dried stick in the dark, but a bark\r\ncanoe could be made to float over the surface of smooth water, almost\r\nwith the instinctive readiness, and certainly with the noiseless\r\nmovements of an aquatic bird.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had got nearly in a line between the camp and the ark before\r\nhe caught a glimpse of the fire. This came upon him suddenly, and a\r\nlittle unexpectedly, at first causing an alarm, lest he had incautiously\r\nventured within the circle of light it cast. But perceiving at a second\r\nglance that he was certainly safe from detection, so long as the Indians\r\nkept near the centre of the illumination, he brought the canoe to\r\na state of rest in the most favourable position he could find, and\r\ncommenced his observations.\r\n\r\nWe have written much, but in vain, concerning this extraordinary being,\r\nif the reader requires now to be told, that, untutored as he was in the\r\nlearning of the world, and simple as he ever showed himself to be in all\r\nmatters touching the subtleties of conventional taste, he was a man\r\nof strong, native, poetical feeling. He loved the woods for their\r\nfreshness, their sublime solitudes, their vastness, and the impress\r\nthat they everywhere bore of the divine hand of their creator. He seldom\r\nmoved through them, without pausing to dwell on some peculiar beauty\r\nthat gave him pleasure, though seldom attempting to investigate the\r\ncauses; and never did a day pass without his communing in spirit, and\r\nthis, too, without the aid of forms or language, with the infinite\r\nsource of all he saw, felt, and beheld. Thus constituted, in a moral\r\nsense, and of a steadiness that no danger could appall, or any crisis\r\ndisturb, it is not surprising that the hunter felt a pleasure at looking\r\non the scene he now beheld, that momentarily caused him to forget the\r\nobject of his visit. This will more fully appear when we describe it.\r\n\r\nThe canoe lay in front of a natural vista, not only through the bushes\r\nthat lined the shore, but of the trees also, that afforded a clear view\r\nof the camp. It was by means of this same opening that the light had\r\nbeen first seen from the ark. In consequence of their recent change\r\nof ground, the Indians had not yet retired to their huts, but had been\r\ndelayed by their preparations, which included lodging as well as food.\r\nA large fire had been made, as much to answer the purpose of torches as\r\nfor the use of their simple cookery; and at this precise moment it was\r\nblazing high and bright, having recently received a large supply of\r\ndried brush. The effect was to illuminate the arches of the forest, and\r\nto render the whole area occupied by the camp as light as if hundreds of\r\ntapers were burning. Most of the toil had ceased, and even the hungriest\r\nchild had satisfied its appetite. In a word, the time was that moment of\r\nrelaxation and general indolence which is apt to succeed a hearty\r\nmeal, and when the labours of the day have ended. The hunters and\r\nthe fishermen had been totally successful; and food, that one great\r\nrequisite of savage life, being abundant, every other care appeared to\r\nhave subsided in the sense of enjoyment dependent on this all-important\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer saw at a glance that many of the warriors were absent.\r\nHis acquaintance Rivenoak, however, was present, being seated in the\r\nforeground of a picture that Salvator Rosa would have delighted to draw,\r\nhis swarthy features illuminated as much by pleasure as by the torchlike\r\nflame, while he showed another of the tribe one of the elephants that\r\nhad caused so much sensation among his people. A boy was looking over\r\nhis shoulder, in dull curiosity, completing the group. More in the\r\nbackground eight or ten warriors lay half recumbent on the ground, or\r\nsat with their backs reclining against trees, so many types of indolent\r\nrepose. Their arms were near them all, sometimes leaning against the\r\nsame trees as themselves, or were lying across their bodies in careless\r\npreparation. But the group that most attracted the attention of\r\nDeerslayer was that composed of the women and children. All the females\r\nappeared to be collected together, and, almost as a matter of course,\r\ntheir young were near them. The former laughed and chatted in their\r\nrebuked and quiet manner, though one who knew the habits of the people\r\nmight have detected that everything was not going on in its usual train.\r\nMost of the young women seemed to be light-hearted enough; but one old\r\nhag was seated apart with a watchful soured aspect, which the hunter at\r\nonce knew betokened that some duty of an unpleasant character had been\r\nassigned her by the chiefs. What that duty was, he had no means of\r\nknowing; but he felt satisfied it must be in some measure connected with\r\nher own sex, the aged among the women generally being chosen for such\r\noffices and no other.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, Deerslayer looked eagerly and anxiously for the\r\nform of Hist. She was nowhere visible though the light penetrated to\r\nconsiderable distances in all directions around the fire. Once or twice\r\nhe started, as he thought he recognized her laugh; but his ears were\r\ndeceived by the soft melody that is so common to the Indian female\r\nvoice. At length the old woman spoke loud and angrily, and then he\r\ncaught a glimpse of one or two dark figures in the background of trees,\r\nwhich turned as if obedient to the rebuke, and walked more within the\r\ncircle of the light. A young warrior\'s form first came fairly into\r\nview; then followed two youthful females, one of whom proved to be the\r\nDelaware girl. Deerslayer now comprehended it all. Hist was watched,\r\npossibly by her young companion, certainly by the old woman. The youth\r\nwas probably some suitor of either her or her companion; but even his\r\ndiscretion was distrusted under the influence of his admiration. The\r\nknown vicinity of those who might be supposed to be her friends, and the\r\narrival of a strange red man on the lake had induced more than the usual\r\ncare, and the girl had not been able to slip away from those who watched\r\nher in order to keep her appointment. Deerslayer traced her uneasiness\r\nby her attempting once or twice to look up through the branches of the\r\ntrees, as if endeavouring to get glimpses of the star she had herself\r\nnamed as the sign for meeting. All was vain, however, and after\r\nstrolling about the camp a little longer, in affected indifference, the\r\ntwo girls quitted their male escort, and took seats among their own sex.\r\nAs soon as this was done, the old sentinel changed her place to one\r\nmore agreeable to herself, a certain proof that she had hitherto been\r\nexclusively on watch.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer now felt greatly at a loss how to proceed. He well knew\r\nthat Chingachgook could never be persuaded to return to the ark without\r\nmaking some desperate effort for the recovery of his mistress, and his\r\nown generous feelings well disposed him to aid in such an undertaking.\r\nHe thought he saw the signs of an intention among the females to retire\r\nfor the night; and should he remain, and the fire continue to give out\r\nits light, he might discover the particular hut or arbour under which\r\nHist reposed; a circumstance that would be of infinite use in their\r\nfuture proceedings. Should he remain, however, much longer where he was,\r\nthere was great danger that the impatience of his friend would drive him\r\ninto some act of imprudence. At each instant, indeed, he expected to see\r\nthe swarthy form of the Delaware appearing in the background, like the\r\ntiger prowling around the fold. Taking all things into consideration,\r\ntherefore, he came to the conclusion it would be better to rejoin his\r\nfriend, and endeavour to temper his impetuosity by some of his own\r\ncoolness and discretion. It required but a minute or two to put this\r\nplan in execution, the canoe returning to the strand some ten or fifteen\r\nminutes after it had left it.\r\n\r\nContrary to his expectations, perhaps, Deerslayer found the Indian at\r\nhis post, from which he had not stirred, fearful that his betrothed\r\nmight arrive during his absence. A conference followed, in which\r\nChingachgook was made acquainted with the state of things in the camp.\r\nWhen Hist named the point as the place of meeting, it was with the\r\nexpectation of making her escape from the old position, and of repairing\r\nto a spot that she expected to find without any occupants; but the\r\nsudden change of localities had disconcerted all her plans. A much\r\ngreater degree of vigilance than had been previously required was now\r\nnecessary; and the circumstance that an aged woman was on watch also\r\ndenoted some special grounds of alarm. All these considerations, and\r\nmany more that will readily suggest themselves to the reader, were\r\nbriefly discussed before the young men came to any decision. The\r\noccasion, however, being one that required acts instead of words, the\r\ncourse to be pursued was soon chosen.\r\n\r\nDisposing of the canoe in such a manner that Hist must see it, should\r\nshe come to the place of meeting previously to their return, the young\r\nmen looked to their arms and prepared to enter the wood. The whole\r\nprojection into the lake contained about two acres of land; and the part\r\nthat formed the point, and on which the camp was placed, did not compose\r\na surface of more than half that size. It was principally covered with\r\noaks, which, as is usual in the American forests, grew to a great height\r\nwithout throwing out a branch, and then arched in a dense and rich\r\nfoliage. Beneath, except the fringe of thick bushes along the shore,\r\nthere was very little underbrush; though, in consequence of their shape,\r\nthe trees were closer together than is common in regions where the\r\naxe has been freely used, resembling tall, straight, rustic columns,\r\nupholding the usual canopy of leaves. The surface of the land was\r\ntolerably even, but it had a small rise near its centre, which divided\r\nit into a northern and southern half. On the latter, the Hurons had\r\nbuilt their fire, profiting by the formation to conceal it from their\r\nenemies, who, it will be remembered, were supposed to be in the castle,\r\nwhich bore northerly. A brook also came brawling down the sides of the\r\nadjacent hills, and found its way into the lake on the southern side\r\nof the point. It had cut for itself a deep passage through some of the\r\nhigher portions of the ground, and, in later days, when this spot has\r\nbecome subjected to the uses of civilization, by its windings and shaded\r\nbanks, it has become no mean accessory in contributing to the beauty of\r\nthe place. This brook lay west of the encampment, and its waters found\r\ntheir way into the great reservoir of that region on the same side, and\r\nquite near to the spot chosen for the fire. All these peculiarities,\r\nso far as circumstances allowed, had been noted by Deerslayer, and\r\nexplained to his friend.\r\n\r\nThe reader will understand that the little rise in the ground, that lay\r\nbehind the Indian encampment, greatly favoured the secret advance of the\r\ntwo adventurers. It prevented the light of the fire diffusing itself on\r\nthe ground directly in the rear, although the land fell away towards the\r\nwater, so as to leave what might be termed the left, or eastern flank\r\nof the position unprotected by this covering. We have said unprotected,\r\nthough that is not properly the word, since the knoll behind the\r\nhuts and the fire offered a cover for those who were now stealthily\r\napproaching, rather than any protection to the Indians. Deerslayer did\r\nnot break through the fringe of bushes immediately abreast of the canoe,\r\nwhich might have brought him too suddenly within the influence of the\r\nlight, since the hillock did not extend to the water; but he followed\r\nthe beach northerly until he had got nearly on the opposite side of\r\nthe tongue of land, which brought him under the shelter of the low\r\nacclivity, and consequently more in the shadow.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the friends emerged from the bushes, they stopped to\r\nreconnoitre. The fire was still blazing behind the little ridge, casting\r\nits light upward into the tops of the trees, producing an effect that\r\nwas more pleasing than advantageous. Still the glare had its uses; for,\r\nwhile the background was in obscurity, the foreground was in strong\r\nlight; exposing the savages and concealing their foes. Profiting by\r\nthe latter circumstance, the young men advanced cautiously towards the\r\nridge, Deerslayer in front, for he insisted on this arrangement, lest\r\nthe Delaware should be led by his feelings into some indiscretion. It\r\nrequired but a moment to reach the foot of the little ascent, and\r\nthen commenced the most critical part of the enterprise. Moving with\r\nexceeding caution, and trailing his rifle, both to keep its barrel out\r\nof view, and in readiness for service, the hunter put foot before foot,\r\nuntil he had got sufficiently high to overlook the summit, his own head\r\nbeing alone brought into the light. Chingachgook was at his side and\r\nboth paused to take another close examination of the camp. In order,\r\nhowever, to protect themselves against any straggler in the rear, they\r\nplaced their bodies against the trunk of an oak, standing on the side\r\nnext the fire.\r\n\r\nThe view that Deerslayer now obtained of the camp was exactly the\r\nreverse of that he had perceived from the water. The dim figures which\r\nhe had formerly discovered must have been on the summit of the ridge,\r\na few feet in advance of the spot where he was now posted. The fire\r\nwas still blazing brightly, and around it were seated on logs thirteen\r\nwarriors, which accounted for all whom he had seen from the canoe. They\r\nwere conversing, with much earnestness among themselves, the image of\r\nthe elephant passing from hand to hand. The first burst of savage wonder\r\nhad abated, and the question now under discussion was the probable\r\nexistence, the history and the habits of so extraordinary an animal. We\r\nhave not leisure to record the opinions of these rude men on a subject\r\nso consonant to their lives and experience; but little is hazarded in\r\nsaying that they were quite as plausible, and far more ingenious, than\r\nhalf the conjectures that precede the demonstrations of science. However\r\nmuch they may have been at fault as to their conclusions and inferences,\r\nit is certain that they discussed the questions with a zealous and most\r\nundivided attention. For the time being all else was forgotten, and our\r\nadventurers could not have approached at a more fortunate instant.\r\n\r\nThe females were collected near each other, much as Deerslayer had last\r\nseen them, nearly in a line between the place where he now stood and the\r\nfire. The distance from the oak against which the young men leaned and\r\nthe warriors was about thirty yards; the women may have been half that\r\nnumber of yards nigher. The latter, indeed, were so near as to make the\r\nutmost circumspection, as to motion and noise, indispensable. Although\r\nthey conversed in their low, soft voices it was possible, in the\r\nprofound stillness of the woods, even to catch passages of the\r\ndiscourse; and the light-hearted laugh that escaped the girls might\r\noccasionally have reached the canoe. Deerslayer felt the tremolo that\r\npassed through the frame of his friend when the latter first caught the\r\nsweet sounds that issued from the plump, pretty lips of Hist. He even\r\nlaid a hand on the shoulder of the Indian, as a sort of admonition to\r\ncommand himself. As the conversation grew more earnest, each leaned\r\nforward to listen.\r\n\r\n"The Hurons have more curious beasts than that," said one of the girls,\r\ncontemptuously, for, like the men, they conversed of the elephant and\r\nhis qualities. "The Delawares will think this creature wonderful, but\r\nto-morrow no Huron tongue will talk of it. Our young men will find him if\r\nthe animals dare to come near our wigwams!"\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, addressed to Wah-ta-Wah, though she who spoke uttered\r\nher words with an assumed diffidence and humility that prevented her\r\nlooking at the other.\r\n\r\n"The Delawares are so far from letting such creatures come into their\r\ncountry," returned Hist, "that no one has even seen their images there!\r\nTheir young men would frighten away the images as well as the beasts."\r\n\r\n"The Delaware young men!--the nation is women--even the deer walk when\r\nthey hear their hunters coming! Who has ever heard the name of a young\r\nDelaware warrior?"\r\n\r\nThis was said in good-humour, and with a laugh; but it was also said\r\nbitingly. That Hist so felt it, was apparent by the spirit betrayed in\r\nher answer.\r\n\r\n"Who has ever heard the name of a young Delaware?" she repeated\r\nearnestly. "Tamenund, himself, though now as old as the pines on the\r\nhill, or as the eagles in the air, was once young; his name was heard\r\nfrom the great salt lake to the sweet waters of the west. What is the\r\nfamily of Uncas? Where is another as great, though the pale-faces have\r\nploughed up its grates, and trodden on its bones? Do the eagles fly as\r\nhigh, is the deer as swift or the panther as brave? Is there no young\r\nwarrior of that race? Let the Huron maidens open their eyes wider, and\r\nthey may see one called Chingachgook, who is as stately as a young ash,\r\nand as tough as the hickory."\r\n\r\nAs the girl used her figurative language and told her companions to\r\n"open their eyes, and they would see" the Delaware, Deerslayer thrust\r\nhis fingers into the sides of his friend, and indulged in a fit of his\r\nhearty, benevolent laughter. The other smiled; but the language of the\r\nspeaker was too flattering, and the tones of her voice too sweet for\r\nhim to be led away by any accidental coincidence, however ludicrous. The\r\nspeech of Hist produced a retort, and the dispute, though conducted in\r\ngood-humour, and without any of the coarse violence of tone and gesture\r\nthat often impairs the charms of the sex in what is called civilized\r\nlife, grew warm and slightly clamorous. In the midst of this scene,\r\nthe Delaware caused his friend to stoop, so as completely to conceal\r\nhimself, and then he made a noise so closely resembling the little\r\nchirrup of the smallest species of the American squirrel, that\r\nDeerslayer himself, though he had heard the imitation a hundred times,\r\nactually thought it came from one of the little animals skipping about\r\nover his head. The sound is so familiar in the woods, that none of the\r\nHurons paid it the least attention. Hist, however, instantly ceased\r\ntalking, and sat motionless. Still she had sufficient self-command to\r\nabstain from turning her head. She had heard the signal by which her\r\nlover so often called her from the wigwam to the stolen interview,\r\nand it came over her senses and her heart, as the serenade affects the\r\nmaiden in the land of song.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, Chingachgook felt certain that his presence was known.\r\nThis was effecting much, and he could now hope for a bolder line of\r\nconduct on the part of his mistress than she might dare to adopt under\r\nan uncertainty of his situation. It left no doubt of her endeavouring\r\nto aid him in his effort to release her. Deerslayer arose as soon as\r\nthe signal was given, and though he had never held that sweet communion\r\nwhich is known only to lovers, he was not slow to detect the great\r\nchange that had come over the manner of the girl. She still affected to\r\ndispute, though it was no longer with spirit and ingenuity, but what she\r\nsaid was uttered more as a lure to draw her antagonists on to an easy\r\nconquest, than with any hopes of succeeding herself. Once or twice, it\r\nis true, her native readiness suggested a retort, or an argument that\r\nraised a laugh, and gave her a momentary advantage; but these little\r\nsallies, the offspring of mother-wit, served the better to conceal her\r\nreal feelings, and to give to the triumph of the other party a more\r\nnatural air than it might have possessed without them. At length the\r\ndisputants became wearied, and they rose in a body as if about to\r\nseparate. It was now that Hist, for the first time, ventured to turn\r\nher face in the direction whence the signal had come. In doing this,\r\nher movements were natural, but guarded, and she stretched her arm and\r\nyawned, as if overcome with a desire to sleep. The chirrup was again\r\nheard, and the girl felt satisfied as to the position of her lover,\r\nthough the strong light in which she herself was placed, and the\r\ncomparative darkness in which the adventurers stood, prevented her from\r\nseeing their heads, the only portions of their forms that appeared above\r\nthe ridge at all. The tree against which they were posted had a dark\r\nshadow cast upon it by the intervention of an enormous pine that grew\r\nbetween it and the fire, a circumstance which alone would have rendered\r\nobjects within its cloud invisible at any distance. This Deerslayer well\r\nknew, and it was one of the reasons why he had selected this particular\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe moment was near when it became necessary for Hist to act. She was\r\nto sleep in a small hut, or bower, that had been built near where she\r\nstood, and her companion was the aged hag already mentioned. Once within\r\nthe hut, with this sleepless old woman stretched across the entrance, as\r\nwas her nightly practice, the hope of escape was nearly destroyed, and\r\nshe might at any moment be summoned to her bed. Luckily, at this instant\r\none of the warriors called to the old woman by name, and bade her bring\r\nhim water to drink. There was a delicious spring on the northern side of\r\nthe point, and the hag took a gourd from a branch and, summoning Hist\r\nto her side, she moved towards the summit of the ridge, intending to\r\ndescend and cross the point to the natural fountain. All this was\r\nseen and understood by the adventurers, and they fell back into the\r\nobscurity, concealing their persons by trees, until the two females had\r\npassed them. In walking, Hist was held tightly by the hand. As she moved\r\nby the tree that hid Chingachgook and his friend the former felt for his\r\ntomahawk, with the intention to bury it in the brain of the woman. But\r\nthe other saw the hazard of such a measure, since a single scream\r\nmight bring all the warriors upon them, and he was averse to the act\r\non considerations of humanity. His hand, therefore, prevented the blow.\r\nStill as the two moved past, the chirrup was repeated, and the Huron\r\nwoman stopped and faced the tree whence the sounds seemed to proceed,\r\nstanding, at the moment, within six feet of her enemies. She expressed\r\nher surprise that a squirrel should be in motion at so late an hour, and\r\nsaid it boded evil. Hist answered that she had heard the same squirrel\r\nthree times within the last twenty minutes, and that she supposed it\r\nwas waiting to obtain some of the crumbs left from the late supper. This\r\nexplanation appeared satisfactory, and they moved towards the spring,\r\nthe men following stealthily and closely. The gourd was filled, and the\r\nold woman was hurrying back, her hand still grasping the wrist of the\r\ngirl, when she was suddenly seized so violently by the throat as to\r\ncause her to release her captive, and to prevent her making any other\r\nsound than a sort of gurgling, suffocating noise. The Serpent passed his\r\narm round the waist of his mistress and dashed through the bushes with\r\nher, on the north side of the point. Here he immediately turned along\r\nthe beach and ran towards the canoe. A more direct course could have\r\nbeen taken, but it might have led to a discovery of the place of\r\nembarking.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer kept playing on the throat of the old woman like the keys of\r\nan organ, occasionally allowing her to breathe, and then compressing\r\nhis fingers again nearly to strangling. The brief intervals for breath,\r\nhowever, were well improved, and the hag succeeded in letting out a\r\nscreech or two that served to alarm the camp. The tramp of the warriors,\r\nas they sprang from the fire, was plainly audible, and at the next\r\nmoment three or four of them appeared on the top of the ridge, drawn\r\nagainst the background of light, resembling the dim shadows of the\r\nphantasmagoria. It was now quite time for the hunter to retreat.\r\nTripping up the heels of his captive, and giving her throat a parting\r\nsqueeze, quite as much in resentment at her indomitable efforts to sound\r\nthe alarm as from any policy, he left her on her back, and moved towards\r\nthe bushes, his rifle at a poise, and his head over his shoulders, like\r\na lion at bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n   "There, ye wise saints, behold your light, your star,\r\n    Ye would be dupes and victims and ye are.\r\n    Is it enough?  or, must I, while a thrill\r\n    Lives in your sapient bosoms, cheat you still?"\r\n\r\n    Thomas Moore, Lalla Rookh, "The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan"\r\n\r\nThe fire, the canoe, and the spring, near which Deerslayer commenced his\r\nretreat, would have stood in the angles of a triangle of tolerably equal\r\nsides. The distance from the fire to the boat was a little less than the\r\ndistance from the fire to the spring, while the distance from the spring\r\nto the boat was about equal to that between the two points first named.\r\nThis, however, was in straight lines, a means of escape to which the\r\nfugitives could not resort. They were obliged to have recourse to\r\na detour in order to get the cover of the bushes, and to follow the\r\ncurvature of the beach. Under these disadvantages, then, the hunter\r\ncommenced his retreat, disadvantages that he felt to be so much the\r\ngreater from his knowledge of the habits of all Indians, who rarely fail\r\nin cases of sudden alarms, more especially when in the midst of cover,\r\nimmediately to throw out flankers, with a view to meet their foes at all\r\npoints, and if possible to turn their rear. That some such course was\r\nnow adopted he believed from the tramp of feet, which not only came up\r\nthe ascent, as related, but were also heard, under the first impulse,\r\ndiverging not only towards the hill in the rear, but towards the\r\nextremity of the point, in a direction opposite to that he was about\r\nto take himself. Promptitude, consequently became a matter of the last\r\nimportance, as the parties might meet on the strand, before the fugitive\r\ncould reach the canoe.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the pressing nature of the emergency, Deerslayer\r\nhesitated a single instant, ere he plunged into the bushes that lined\r\nthe shore. His feelings had been awakened by the whole scene, and a\r\nsternness of purpose had come over him, to which he was ordinarily\r\na stranger. Four dark figures loomed on the ridge, drawn against the\r\nbrightness of the fire, and an enemy might have been sacrificed at a\r\nglance. The Indians had paused to gaze into the gloom, in search of the\r\nscreeching hag, and with many a man less given to reflection than the\r\nhunter, the death of one of them would have been certain. Luckily he was\r\nmore prudent. Although the rifle dropped a little towards the foremost\r\nof his pursuers, he did not aim or fire, but disappeared in the\r\ncover. To gain the beach, and to follow it round to the place where\r\nChingachgook was already in the canoe, with Hist, anxiously waiting his\r\nappearance, occupied but a moment. Laying his rifle in the bottom of the\r\ncanoe, Deerslayer stooped to give the latter a vigorous shove from the\r\nshore, when a powerful Indian leaped through the bushes, alighting like\r\na panther on his back. Everything was now suspended by a hair; a false\r\nstep ruining all. With a generosity that would have rendered a Roman\r\nillustrious throughout all time, but which, in the career of one so\r\nsimple and humble, would have been forever lost to the world but\r\nfor this unpretending legend, Deerslayer threw all his force into a\r\ndesperate effort, shoved the canoe off with a power that sent it a\r\nhundred feet from the shore, as it might be in an instant, and fell\r\nforward into the lake, himself, face downward; his assailant necessarily\r\nfollowing him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the water was deep within a few yards of the beach, it was not\r\nmore than breast high, as close in as the spot where the two combatants\r\nfell. Still this was quite sufficient to destroy one who had sunk, under\r\nthe great disadvantages in which Deerslayer was placed. His hands were\r\nfree, however, and the savage was compelled to relinquish his hug,\r\nto keep his own face above the surface. For half a minute there was a\r\ndesperate struggle, like the floundering of an alligator that has just\r\nseized some powerful prey, and then both stood erect, grasping each\r\nother\'s arms, in order to prevent the use of the deadly knife in\r\nthe darkness. What might have been the issue of this severe personal\r\nstruggle cannot be known, for half a dozen savages came leaping into\r\nthe water to the aid of their friend, and Deerslayer yielded himself a\r\nprisoner, with a dignity that was as remarkable as his self-devotion.\r\n\r\nTo quit the lake and lead their new captive to the fire occupied the\r\nIndians but another minute. So much engaged were they all with the\r\nstruggle and its consequences, that the canoe was unseen, though it\r\nstill lay so near the shore as to render every syllable that was uttered\r\nperfectly intelligible to the Delaware and his betrothed; and the whole\r\nparty left the spot, some continuing the pursuit after Hist, along the\r\nbeach, though most proceeded to the light. Here Deerslayer\'s antagonist\r\nso far recovered his breath and his recollection, for he had been\r\nthrottled nearly to strangulation, as to relate the manner in which the\r\ngirl had got off. It was now too late to assail the other fugitives, for\r\nno sooner was his friend led into the bushes than the Delaware placed\r\nhis paddle into the water, and the light canoe glided noiselessly away,\r\nholding its course towards the centre of the lake until safe from shot,\r\nafter which it sought the Ark. When Deerslayer reached the fire, he\r\nfound himself surrounded by no less than eight grim savages, among\r\nwhom was his old acquaintance Rivenoak. As soon as the latter caught a\r\nglimpse of the captive\'s countenance, he spoke apart to his companions,\r\nand a low but general exclamation of pleasure and surprise escaped them.\r\nThey knew that the conqueror of their late friend, he who had fallen on\r\nthe opposite side of the lake, was in their hands, and subject to their\r\nmercy, or vengeance. There was no little admiration mingled in the\r\nferocious looks that were thrown on the prisoner; an admiration that\r\nwas as much excited by his present composure, as by his past deeds.\r\nThis scene may be said to have been the commencement of the great and\r\nterrible reputation that Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, as he was afterwards\r\ncalled, enjoyed among all the tribes of New York and Canada; a\r\nreputation that was certainly more limited in its territorial and\r\nnumerical extent, than those which are possessed in civilized life, but\r\nwhich was compensated for what it wanted in these particulars, perhaps,\r\nby its greater justice, and the total absence of mystification and\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Deerslayer were not pinioned, and he was left the free use\r\nof his hands, his knife having been first removed. The only precaution\r\nthat was taken to secure his person was untiring watchfulness, and a\r\nstrong rope of bark that passed from ankle to ankle, not so much\r\nto prevent his walking, as to place an obstacle in the way of his\r\nattempting to escape by any sudden leap. Even this extra provision\r\nagainst flight was not made until the captive had been brought to the\r\nlight, and his character ascertained. It was, in fact, a compliment\r\nto his prowess, and he felt proud of the distinction. That he might be\r\nbound when the warriors slept he thought probable, but to be bound\r\nin the moment of capture showed that he was already, and thus early,\r\nattaining a name. While the young Indians were fastening the rope, he\r\nwondered if Chingachgook would have been treated in the same manner, had\r\nhe too fallen into the hands of the enemy. Nor did the reputation of the\r\nyoung pale-face rest altogether on his success in the previous\r\ncombat, or in his discriminating and cool manner of managing the late\r\nnegotiation, for it had received a great accession by the occurrences\r\nof the night. Ignorant of the movements of the Ark, and of the accident\r\nthat had brought their fire into view, the Iroquois attributed the\r\ndiscovery of their new camp to the vigilance of so shrewd a foe. The\r\nmanner in which he ventured upon the point, the abstraction or escape of\r\nHist, and most of all the self-devotion of the prisoner, united to\r\nthe readiness with which he had sent the canoe adrift, were so many\r\nimportant links in the chain of facts, on which his growing fame was\r\nfounded. Many of these circumstances had been seen, some had been\r\nexplained, and all were understood.\r\n\r\nWhile this admiration and these honors were so unreservedly bestowed on\r\nDeerslayer, he did not escape some of the penalties of his situation.\r\nHe was permitted to seat himself on the end of a log, near the fire,\r\nin order to dry his clothes, his late adversary standing opposite,\r\nnow holding articles of his own scanty vestments to the heat, and now\r\nfeeling his throat, on which the marks of his enemy\'s fingers were still\r\nquite visible. The rest of the warriors consulted together, near at\r\nhand, all those who had been out having returned to report that no signs\r\nof any other prowlers near the camp were to be found. In this state\r\nof things, the old woman, whose name was Shebear, in plain English,\r\napproached Deerslayer, with her fists clenched and her eyes flashing\r\nfire. Hitherto, she had been occupied with screaming, an employment\r\nat which she had played her part with no small degree of success, but\r\nhaving succeeded in effectually alarming all within reach of a pair of\r\nlungs that had been strengthened by long practice, she next turned her\r\nattention to the injuries her own person had sustained in the struggle.\r\nThese were in no manner material, though they were of a nature to arouse\r\nall the fury of a woman who had long ceased to attract by means of the\r\ngentler qualities, and who was much disposed to revenge the hardships\r\nshe had so long endured, as the neglected wife and mother of savages, on\r\nall who came within her power. If Deerslayer had not permanently injured\r\nher, he had temporarily caused her to suffer, and she was not a person\r\nto overlook a wrong of this nature, on account of its motive.\r\n\r\n"Skunk of the pale-faces," commenced this exasperated and semi-poetic\r\nfury, shaking her fist under the nose of the impassable hunter, "you are\r\nnot even a woman. Your friends the Delawares are only women, and you are\r\ntheir sheep. Your own people will not own you, and no tribe of redmen\r\nwould have you in their wigwams; you skulk among petticoated warriors.\r\nYou slay our brave friend who has left us?--No--his great soul scorned\r\nto fight you, and left his body rather than have the shame of slaying\r\nyou! But the blood that you spilt when the spirit was not looking on,\r\nhas not sunk into the ground. It must be buried in your groans. What\r\nmusic do I hear? Those are not the wailings of a red man!--no red\r\nwarrior groans so much like a hog. They come from a pale-face\r\nthroat--a Yengeese bosom, and sound as pleasant as girls\r\nsinging--Dog--skunk--woodchuck-mink--hedgehog--pig--toad--spider--yengee--"\r\n\r\nHere the old woman, having expended her breath and exhausted her\r\nepithets, was fain to pause a moment, though both her fists were shaken\r\nin the prisoner\'s face, and the whole of her wrinkled countenance was\r\nfilled with fierce resentment. Deerslayer looked upon these impotent\r\nattempts to arouse him as indifferently as a gentleman in our own state\r\nof society regards the vituperative terms of a blackguard: the one party\r\nfeeling that the tongue of an old woman could never injure a warrior,\r\nand the other knowing that mendacity and vulgarity can only permanently\r\naffect those who resort to their use; but he was spared any further\r\nattack at present, by the interposition of Rivenoak, who shoved aside\r\nthe hag, bidding her quit the spot, and prepared to take his seat at\r\nthe side of his prisoner. The old woman withdrew, but the hunter well\r\nunderstood that he was to be the subject of all her means of annoyance,\r\nif not of positive injury, so long as he remained in the power of his\r\nenemies, for nothing rankles so deeply as the consciousness that an\r\nattempt to irritate has been met by contempt, a feeling that is usually\r\nthe most passive of any that is harbored in the human breast. Rivenoak\r\nquietly took the seat we have mentioned, and, after a short pause, he\r\ncommenced a dialogue, which we translate as usual, for the benefit of\r\nthose readers who have not studied the North American languages.\r\n\r\n"My pale-face friend is very welcome," said the Indian, with a familiar\r\nnod, and a smile so covert that it required all Deerslayer\'s vigilance\r\nto detect, and not a little of his philosophy to detect unmoved; "he is\r\nwelcome. The Hurons keep a hot fire to dry the white man\'s clothes by."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, Huron--or Mingo, as I most like to call you," returned the\r\nother, "I thank you for the welcome, and I thank you for the fire. Each\r\nis good in its way, and the last is very good, when one has been in a\r\nspring as cold as the Glimmerglass. Even Huron warmth may be pleasant,\r\nat such a time, to a man with a Delaware heart."\r\n\r\n"The pale-face--but my brother has a name? So great a warrior would not\r\nhave lived without a name?"\r\n\r\n"Mingo," said the hunter, a little of the weakness of human nature\r\nexhibiting itself in the glance of his eye, and the colour on his\r\ncheek--"Mingo, your brave called me Hawkeye, I suppose on account of a\r\nquick and sartain aim, when he was lying with his head in my lap, afore\r\nhis spirit started for the Happy Hunting Grounds."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a good name! The hawk is sure of his blow. Hawkeye is not a woman;\r\nwhy does he live with the Delawares?"\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Mingo, but we look on all that as a sarcumvention of\r\nsome of your subtle devils, and deny the charge. Providence placed me\r\namong the Delawares young, and, \'bating what Christian usages demand of\r\nmy colour and gifts, I hope to live and die in their tribe. Still I do\r\nnot mean to throw away altogether my natyve rights, and shall strive to\r\ndo a pale-face\'s duty, in red-skin society."\r\n\r\n"Good; a Huron is a red-skin, as well as a Delaware. Hawkeye is more of\r\na Huron than of a woman."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know, Mingo, your own meaning; if you don\'t I make no\r\nquestion \'tis well known to Satan. But if you wish to get any thing\r\nout of me, speak plainer, for bargains can not be made blindfolded, or\r\ntongue tied."\r\n\r\n"Good; Hawkeye has not a forked tongue, and he likes to say what he\r\nthinks. He is an acquaintance of the Muskrat," this was the name by\r\nwhich all the Indians designated Hutter--"and has lived in his wigwam.\r\nBut he is not a friend. He wants no scalps, like a miserable Indian, but\r\nfights like a stout-hearted pale-face. The Muskrat is neither white, nor\r\nred. Neither a beast nor a fish. He is a water snake; sometimes in the\r\nspring and sometimes on the land. He looks for scalps, like an outcast.\r\nHawkeye can go back and tell him how he has outwitted the Hurons, how he\r\nhas escaped, and when his eyes are in a fog, when he can\'t see as far\r\nas from his cabin to the shore, then Hawkeye can open the door for the\r\nHurons. And how will the plunder be divided? Why, Hawkeye, will carry\r\naway the most, and the Hurons will take what he may choose to leave\r\nbehind him. The scalps can go to Canada, for a pale-face has no\r\nsatisfaction in them."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Rivenoak--for so I hear \'em tarm you--This is plain\r\nEnglish, enough, though spoken in Iroquois. I understand all you mean,\r\nnow, and must say it out-devils even Mingo deviltry! No doubt, \'twould\r\nbe easy enough to go back and tell the Muskrat that I had got away from\r\nyou, and gain some credit, too, by the expl\'ite."\r\n\r\n"Good. That is what I want the pale-face to do."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes--That\'s plain enough. I know what you want me to do, without\r\nmore words. When inside the house, and eating the Muskrat\'s bread, and\r\nlaughing and talking with his pretty darters, I might put his eyes into\r\nso thick a fog, that he couldn\'t even see the door, much less the land."\r\n\r\n"Good! Hawkeye should have been born a Huron! His blood is not more than\r\nhalf white!"\r\n\r\n"There you\'re out, Huron; yes, there you\'re as much out, as if you\r\nmistook a wolf for a catamount. I\'m white in blood, heart, natur\' and\r\ngifts, though a little red-skin in feelin\'s and habits. But when old\r\nHutter\'s eyes are well befogged, and his pretty darters perhaps in a\r\ndeep sleep, and Hurry Harry, the Great Pine as you Indians tarm him, is\r\ndreaming of any thing but mischief, and all suppose Hawkeye is acting as\r\na faithful sentinel, all I have to do is set a torch somewhere in sight\r\nfor a signal, open the door, and let in the Hurons, to knock \'em all on\r\nthe head."\r\n\r\n"Surely my brother is mistaken. He cannot be white! He is worthy to be a\r\ngreat chief among the Hurons!"\r\n\r\n"That is true enough, I dares to say, if he could do all this. Now,\r\nharkee, Huron, and for once hear a few honest words from the mouth of a\r\nplain man. I am Christian born, and them that come of such a stock, and\r\nthat listen to the words that were spoken to their fathers and will be\r\nspoken to their children, until \'arth and all it holds perishes, can\r\nnever lend themselves to such wickedness. Sarcumventions in war, may\r\nbe, and are, lawful; but sarcumventions, and deceit, and treachery among\r\nfri\'inds are fit only for the pale-face devils. I know that there are\r\nwhite men enough to give you this wrong idee of our natur\', but such\r\nbe ontrue to their blood and gifts, and ought to be, if they are not,\r\noutcasts and vagabonds. No upright pale-face could do what you wish,\r\nand to be as plain with you as I wish to be, in my judgment no upright\r\nDelaware either. With a Mingo it may be different."\r\n\r\nThe Huron listened to this rebuke with obvious disgust, but he had his\r\nends in view, and was too wily to lose all chance of effecting them by\r\na precipitate avowal of resentment. Affecting to smile, he seemed to\r\nlisten eagerly, and he then pondered on what he had heard.\r\n\r\n"Does Hawkeye love the Muskrat?" he abruptly demanded; "Or does he love\r\nhis daughters?"\r\n\r\n"Neither, Mingo. Old Tom is not a man to gain my love, and, as for the\r\ndarters, they are comely enough to gain the liking of any young man,\r\nbut there\'s reason ag\'in any very great love for either. Hetty is a good\r\nsoul, but natur\' has laid a heavy hand on her mind, poor thing."\r\n\r\n"And the Wild Rose!" exclaimed the Huron--for the fame of Judith\'s\r\nbeauty had spread among those who could travel the wilderness, as well\r\nas the highway by means of old eagles\' nests, rocks, and riven trees\r\nknown to them by report and tradition, as well as among the white\r\nborderers, "And the Wild Rose; is she not sweet enough to be put in the\r\nbosom of my brother?"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had far too much of the innate gentleman to insinuate\r\naught against the fair fame of one who, by nature and position was so\r\nhelpless, and as he did not choose to utter an untruth, he preferred\r\nbeing silent. The Huron mistook the motive, and supposed that\r\ndisappointed affection lay at the bottom of his reserve. Still bent on\r\ncorrupting or bribing his captive, in order to obtain possession of the\r\ntreasures with which his imagination filled the Castle, he persevered in\r\nhis attack.\r\n\r\n"Hawkeye is talking with a friend," he continued. "He knows that\r\nRivenoak is a man of his word, for they have traded together, and trade\r\nopens the soul. My friend has come here on account of a little string\r\nheld by a girl, that can pull the whole body of the sternest warrior?"\r\n\r\n"You are nearer the truth, now, Huron, than you\'ve been afore, since we\r\nbegan to talk. This is true. But one end of that string was not fast to\r\nmy heart, nor did the Wild Rose hold the other."\r\n\r\n"This is wonderful! Does my brother love in his head, and not in his\r\nheart? And can the Feeble Mind pull so hard against so stout a warrior?"\r\n\r\n"There it is ag\'in; sometimes right, and sometimes wrong! The string you\r\nmean is fast to the heart of a great Delaware; one of Mohican stock in\r\nfact, living among the Delawares since the disparsion of his own people,\r\nand of the family of Uncas--Chingachgook by name, or Great Sarpent.\r\nHe has come here, led by the string, and I\'ve followed, or rather come\r\nafore, for I got here first, pulled by nothing stronger than fri\'ndship;\r\nwhich is strong enough for such as are not niggardly of their feelin\'s,\r\nand are willing to live a little for their fellow creatur\'s, as well as\r\nfor themselves."\r\n\r\n"But a string has two ends--one is fast to the mind of a Mohican; and\r\nthe other?"\r\n\r\n"Why the other was here close to the fire, half an hour since.\r\nWah-ta-Wah held it in her hand, if she didn\'t hold it to her heart."\r\n\r\n"I understand what you mean, my brother," returned the Indian gravely,\r\nfor the first time catching a direct clue to the adventures of the\r\nevening. "The Great Serpent, being strongest, pulled the hardest, and\r\nHist was forced to leave us."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there was much pulling about it," answered the other,\r\nlaughing, always in his silent manner, with as much heartiness as if he\r\nwere not a captive, and in danger of torture or death--"I don\'t think\r\nthere was much pulling about it; no I don\'t. Lord help you, Huron!\r\nHe likes the gal, and the gal likes him, and it surpassed Huron\r\nsarcumventions to keep two young people apart, where there was so strong\r\na feelin\' to bring \'em together."\r\n\r\n"And Hawkeye and Chingachgook came into our camp on this errand, only?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a question that\'ll answer itself, Mingo! Yes, if a question\r\ncould talk it would answer itself, to your parfect satisfaction. For\r\nwhat else should we come? And yet, it isn\'t exactly so, neither; for we\r\ndidn\'t come into your camp at all, but only as far as that pine, there,\r\nthat you see on the other side of the ridge, where we stood watching\r\nyour movements, and conduct, as long as we liked. When we were ready,\r\nthe Sarpent gave his signal, and then all went just as it should, down\r\nto the moment when yonder vagabond leaped upon my back. Sartain; we come\r\nfor that, and for no other purpose, and we got what we come for; there\'s\r\nno use in pretending otherwise. Hist is off with a man who\'s the next\r\nthing to her husband, and come what will to me, that\'s one good thing\r\ndetarmined."\r\n\r\n"What sign, or signal, told the young maiden that her lover was nigh?"\r\nasked the Huron with more curiosity than it was usual for him to betray.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer laughed again, and seem\'d to enjoy the success of the\r\nexploit, with as much glee as if he had not been its victim.\r\n\r\n"Your squirrels are great gadabouts, Mingo," he cried still\r\nlaughing--"yes, they\'re sartainly great gadabouts! When other folk\'s\r\nsquirrels are at home and asleep, yourn keep in motion among the trees,\r\nand chirrup and sing, in a way that even a Delaware gal can understand\r\ntheir musick! Well, there\'s four legged squirrels, and there\'s two\r\nlegged squirrels, and give me the last, when there\'s a good tight string\r\natween two hearts. If one brings \'em together, t\'other tells when to\r\npull hardest!"\r\n\r\nThe Huron looked vexed, though he succeeded in suppressing any violent\r\nexhibition of resentment. He now quitted his prisoner and, joining\r\nthe rest of the warriors, he communicated the substance of what he had\r\nlearned. As in his own case, admiration was mingled with anger at the\r\nboldness and success of their enemies. Three or four of them ascended\r\nthe little acclivity and gazed at the tree where it was understood the\r\nadventurers had posted themselves, and one even descended to it, and\r\nexamined for foot prints around its roots, in order to make sure that\r\nthe statement was true. The result confirmed the story of the captive,\r\nand they all returned to the fire with increased wonder and respect. The\r\nmessenger who had arrived with some communication from the party above,\r\nwhile the two adventurers were watching the camp, was now despatched\r\nwith some answer, and doubtless bore with him the intelligence of all\r\nthat had happened.\r\n\r\nDown to this moment, the young Indian who had been seen walking in\r\ncompany with Hist and another female had made no advances to any\r\ncommunication with Deerslayer. He had held himself aloof from his\r\nfriends, even, passing near the bevy of younger women, who were\r\nclustering together, apart as usual, and conversed in low tones on the\r\nsubject of the escape of their late companion. Perhaps it would be true\r\nto say that these last were pleased as well as vexed at what had just\r\noccurred. Their female sympathies were with the lovers, while their\r\npride was bound up in the success of their own tribe. It is possible,\r\ntoo, that the superior personal advantages of Hist rendered her\r\ndangerous to some of the younger part of the group, and they were not\r\nsorry to find she was no longer in the way of their own ascendency. On\r\nthe whole, however, the better feeling was most prevalent, for neither\r\nthe wild condition in which they lived, the clannish prejudices of\r\ntribes, nor their hard fortunes as Indian women, could entirely conquer\r\nthe inextinguishable leaning of their sex to the affections. One of the\r\ngirls even laughed at the disconsolate look of the swain who might fancy\r\nhimself deserted, a circumstance that seemed suddenly to arouse his\r\nenergies, and induce him to move towards the log, on which the prisoner\r\nwas still seated, drying his clothes.\r\n\r\n"This is Catamount!" said the Indian, striking his hand boastfully on\r\nhis naked breast, as he uttered the words in a manner to show how much\r\nweight he expected them to carry.\r\n\r\n"This is Hawkeye," quietly returned Deerslayer, adopting the name by\r\nwhich he knew he would be known in future, among all the tribes of the\r\nIroquois. "My sight is keen; is my brother\'s leap long?"\r\n\r\n"From here to the Delaware villages. Hawkeye has stolen my wife; he must\r\nbring her back, or his scalp will hang on a pole, and dry in my wigwam."\r\n\r\n"Hawkeye has stolen nothing, Huron. He doesn\'t come of a thieving breed,\r\nnor has he thieving gifts. Your wife, as you call Wah-ta-Wah, will never\r\nbe the wife of any red-skin of the Canadas; her mind is in the cabin of\r\na Delaware, and her body has gone to find it. The catamount is actyve I\r\nknow, but its legs can\'t keep pace with a woman\'s wishes."\r\n\r\n"The Serpent of the Delawares is a dog--he is a poor bull trout that\r\nkeeps in the water; he is afraid to stand on the hard earth, like a\r\nbrave Indian!"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Huron, that\'s pretty impudent, considering it\'s not an hour\r\nsince the Sarpent stood within a hundred feet of you, and would have\r\ntried the toughness of your skin with a rifle bullet, when I pointed you\r\nout to him, hadn\'t I laid the weight of a little judgment on his hand.\r\nYou may take in timorsome gals in the settlements, with your catamount\r\nwhine, but the ears of a man can tell truth from ontruth."\r\n\r\n"Hist laughs at him! She sees he is lame, and a poor hunter, and he has\r\nnever been on a war path. She will take a man for a husband, and not a\r\nfish."\r\n\r\n"How do you know that, Catamount? how do you know that?" returned\r\nDeerslayer laughing. "She has gone into the lake, you see, and maybe she\r\nprefars a trout to a mongrel cat. As for war paths, neither the Sarpent\r\nnor I have much exper\'ence, we are ready to own, but if you don\'t call\r\nthis one, you must tarm it, what the gals in the settlements tarm it,\r\nthe high road to matrimony. Take my advice, Catamount, and s\'arch for\r\na wife among the Huron women; you\'ll never get one with a willing mind\r\nfrom among the Delawares."\r\n\r\nCatamount\'s hand felt for his tomahawk, and when the fingers reached\r\nthe handle they worked convulsively, as if their owner hesitated between\r\npolicy and resentment. At this critical moment Rivenoak approached, and\r\nby a gesture of authority, induced the young man to retire, assuming his\r\nformer position, himself, on the log at the side of Deerslayer. Here he\r\ncontinued silent for a little time, maintaining the grave reserve of an\r\nIndian chief.\r\n\r\n"Hawkeye is right," the Iroquois at length began; "his sight is so\r\nstrong that he can see truth in a dark night, and our eyes have been\r\nblinded. He is an owl, darkness hiding nothing from him. He ought not to\r\nstrike his friends. He is right."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you think so, Mingo," returned the other, "for a traitor, in\r\nmy judgment, is worse than a coward. I care as little for the Muskrat,\r\nas one pale-face ought to care for another, but I care too much for him\r\nto ambush him in the way you wished. In short, according to my idees,\r\nany sarcumventions, except open-war sarcumventions, are ag\'in both law,\r\nand what we whites call \'gospel\', too."\r\n\r\n"My pale-face brother is right; he is no Indian, to forget his Manitou\r\nand his colour. The Hurons know that they have a great warrior for their\r\nprisoner, and they will treat him as one. If he is to be tortured, his\r\ntorments shall be such as no common man can bear; if he is to be treated\r\nas a friend, it will be the friendship of chiefs."\r\n\r\nAs the Huron uttered this extraordinary assurance of consideration, his\r\neye furtively glanced at the countenance of his listener, in order to\r\ndiscover how he stood the compliment, though his gravity and apparent\r\nsincerity would have prevented any man but one practised in artifices,\r\nfrom detecting his motives. Deerslayer belonged to the class of the\r\nunsuspicious, and acquainted with the Indian notions of what constitutes\r\nrespect, in matters connected with the treatment of captives, he felt\r\nhis blood chill at the announcement, even while he maintained an aspect\r\nso steeled that his quick sighted enemy could discover in it no signs of\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n"God has put me in your hands, Huron," the captive at length answered,\r\n"and I suppose you will act your will on me. I shall not boast of what\r\nI can do, under torment, for I\'ve never been tried, and no man can say\r\ntill he has been; but I\'ll do my endivours not to disgrace the people\r\namong whom I got my training. Howsever, I wish you now to bear witness\r\nthat I\'m altogether of white blood, and, in a nat\'ral way of white gifts\r\ntoo; so, should I be overcome and forget myself, I hope you\'ll lay\r\nthe fault where it properly belongs, and in no manner put it on the\r\nDelawares, or their allies and friends the Mohicans. We\'re all created\r\nwith more or less weakness, and I\'m afeard it\'s a pale-face\'s to give\r\nin under great bodily torment, when a red-skin will sing his songs, and\r\nboast of his deeds in the very teeth of his foes."\r\n\r\n"We shall see. Hawkeye has a good countenance, and he is tough--but why\r\nshould he be tormented, when the Hurons love him? He is not born their\r\nenemy, and the death of one warrior will not cast a cloud between them\r\nforever."\r\n\r\n"So much the better, Huron; so much the better. Still I don\'t wish to\r\nowe any thing to a mistake about each other\'s meaning. It is so much\r\nthe better that you bear no malice for the loss of a warrior who fell\r\nin war, and yet it is ontrue that there is no inmity--lawful inmity\r\nI mean--atween us. So far as I have red-skin feelin\'s at all, I\'ve\r\nDelaware feelin\'s, and I leave you to judge for yourself how far they\r\nare likely to be fri\'ndly to the Mingos--"\r\n\r\nDeerslayer ceased, for a sort of spectre stood before him, that put a\r\nstop to his words, and, indeed, caused him for a moment to doubt the\r\nfidelity of his boasted vision. Hetty Hutter was standing at the side of\r\nthe fire as quietly as if she belonged to the tribe.\r\n\r\nAs the hunter and the Indian sat watching the emotions that were\r\nbetrayed in each other\'s countenance, the girl had approached unnoticed,\r\ndoubtless ascending from the beach on the southern side of the point,\r\nor that next to the spot where the Ark had anchored, and had advanced\r\nto the fire with the fearlessness that belonged to her simplicity, and\r\nwhich was certainly justified by the treatment formerly received from\r\nthe Indians. As soon as Rivenoak perceived the girl, she was recognised,\r\nand calling to two or three of the younger warriors, the chief sent\r\nthem out to reconnoitre, lest her appearance should be the forerunner of\r\nanother attack. He then motioned to Hetty to draw near.\r\n\r\n"I hope your visit is a sign that the Sarpent and Hist are in safety,\r\nHetty," said Deerslayer, as soon as the girl had complied with the\r\nHuron\'s request. "I don\'t think you\'d come ashore ag\'in, on the arr\'nd\r\nthat brought you here afore."\r\n\r\n"Judith told me to come this time, Deerslayer," Hetty replied, "she\r\npaddled me ashore herself, in a canoe, as soon as the Serpent had shown\r\nher Hist and told his story. How handsome Hist is to-night, Deerslayer,\r\nand how much happier she looks than when she was with the Hurons!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s natur\' gal; yes, that may be set down as human natur\'. She\'s\r\nwith her betrothed, and no longer fears a Mingo husband. In my judgment\r\nJudith, herself, would lose most of her beauty if she thought she was\r\nto bestow it all on a Mingo! Content is a great fortifier of good looks,\r\nand I\'ll warrant you, Hist is contented enough, now she is out of the\r\nhands of these miscreants, and with her chosen warrior! Did you say that\r\nJudith told you to come ashore--why should your sister do that?"\r\n\r\n"She bid me come to see you, and to try and persuade the savages to take\r\nmore elephants to let you off, but I\'ve brought the Bible with me--that\r\nwill do more than all the elephants in father\'s chest!"\r\n\r\n"And your father, good little Hetty--and Hurry; did they know of your\r\narr\'nd?"\r\n\r\n"Not they. Both are asleep, and Judith and the Serpent thought it\r\nbest they should not be woke, lest they might want to come again after\r\nscalps, when Hist had told them how few warriors, and how many women and\r\nchildren there were in the camp. Judith would give me no peace, till I\r\nhad come ashore to see what had happened to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s remarkable as consarns Judith! Whey should she feel so\r\nmuch unsartainty about me?--Ah---I see how it is, now; yes, I see into\r\nthe whole matter, now. You must understand, Hetty, that your sister is\r\noneasy lest Harry March should wake, and come blundering here into\r\nthe hands of the inimy ag\'in, under some idee that, being a travelling\r\ncomrade, he ought to help me in this matter! Hurry is a blunderer, I\r\nwill allow, but I don\'t think he\'d risk as much for my sake, as he would\r\nfor his own."\r\n\r\n"Judith don\'t care for Hurry, though Hurry cares for her," replied Hetty\r\ninnocently, but quite positively.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard you say as much as that afore; yes, I\'ve heard that from\r\nyou, afore, gal, and yet it isn\'t true. One don\'t live in a tribe, not\r\nto see something of the way in which liking works in a woman\'s heart.\r\nThough no way given to marrying myself, I\'ve been a looker on among the\r\nDelawares, and this is a matter in which pale-face and red-skin gifts\r\nare all as one as the same. When the feelin\' begins, the young woman\r\nis thoughtful, and has no eyes or ears onless for the warrior that has\r\ntaken her fancy; then follows melancholy and sighing, and such sort\r\nof actions; after which, especially if matters don\'t come to plain\r\ndiscourse, she often flies round to back biting and fault finding,\r\nblaming the youth for the very things she likes best in him. Some young\r\ncreatur\'s are forward in this way of showing their love, and I\'m of\r\nopinion Judith is one of \'em. Now, I\'ve heard her as much as deny that\r\nHurry was good-looking, and the young woman who could do that, must be\r\nfar gone indeed!"\r\n\r\n"The young woman who liked Hurry would own that he is handsome. I think\r\nHurry very handsome, Deerslayer, and I\'m sure everybody must think so,\r\nthat has eyes. Judith don\'t like Harry March, and that\'s the reason she\r\nfinds fault with him."\r\n\r\n"Well--well--my good little Hetty, have it your own way. If we should\r\ntalk from now till winter, each would think as at present, and there\'s\r\nno use in words. I must believe that Judith is much wrapped up in Hurry,\r\nand that, sooner or later, she\'ll have him; and this, too, all the more\r\nfrom the manner in which she abuses him; and I dare to say, you think\r\njust the contrary. But mind what I now tell you, gal, and pretend not\r\nto know it," continued this being, who was so obtuse on a point on\r\nwhich men are usually quick enough to make discoveries, and so acute in\r\nmatters that would baffle the observation of much the greater portion\r\nof mankind, "I see how it is, with them vagabonds. Rivenoak has left us,\r\nyou see, and is talking yonder with his young men, and though too far\r\nto be heard, I can see what he is telling them. Their orders is to watch\r\nyour movements, and to find where the canoe is to meet you, to take\r\nyou back to the Ark, and then to seize all and what they can. I\'m sorry\r\nJudith sent you, for I suppose she wants you to go back ag\'in."\r\n\r\n"All that\'s settled, Deerslayer," returned the girl, in a low,\r\nconfidential and meaning manner, "and you may trust me to outwit the\r\nbest Indian of them all. I know I am feeble minded, but I\'ve got some\r\nsense, and you\'ll see how I\'ll use it in getting back, when my errand is\r\ndone!"\r\n\r\n"Ahs! me, poor girl; I\'m afeard all that\'s easier said than done.\r\nThey\'re a venomous set of riptyles and their p\'ison\'s none the milder,\r\nfor the loss of Hist. Well, I\'m glad the Sarpent was the one to get off\r\nwith the gal, for now there\'ll be two happy at least, whereas had he\r\nfallen into the hands of the Mingos, there\'d been two miserable, and\r\nanother far from feelin\' as a man likes to feel."\r\n\r\n"Now you put me in mind of a part of my errand that I had almost\r\nforgotten, Deerslayer. Judith told me to ask you what you thought the\r\nHurons would do with you, if you couldn\'t be bought off, and what she\r\nhad best do to serve you. Yes, this was the most important part of the\r\nerrand--what she had best do, in order to serve you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s as you think, Hetty; but it\'s no matter. Young women are apt to\r\nlay most stress on what most touches their feelin\'s; but no matter; have\r\nit your own way, so you be but careful not to let the vagabonds get\r\nthe mastery of a canoe. When you get back to the Ark, tell \'em to keep\r\nclose, and to keep moving too, most especially at night. Many hours\r\ncan\'t go by without the troops on the river hearing of this party, and\r\nthen your fri\'nds may look for relief. \'Tis but a day\'s march from the\r\nnearest garrison, and true soldiers will never lie idle with the foe in\r\ntheir neighborhood. This is my advice, and you may say to your father\r\nand Hurry that scalp-hunting will be a poor business now, as the Mingos\r\nare up and awake, and nothing can save \'em, \'till the troops come,\r\nexcept keeping a good belt of water atween \'em and the savages."\r\n\r\n"What shall I tell Judith about you, Deerslayer; I know she will send me\r\nback again, if I don\'t bring her the truth about you."\r\n\r\n"Then tell her the truth. I see no reason Judith Hutter shouldn\'t hear\r\nthe truth about me, as well as a lie. I\'m a captyve in Indian hands, and\r\nProvidence only knows what will come of it! Harkee, Hetty," dropping\r\nhis voice and speaking still more confidentially, "you are a little weak\r\nminded, it must be allowed, but you know something of Injins. Here I am\r\nin their hands, after having slain one of their stoutest warriors, and\r\nthey\'ve been endivouring to work upon me through fear of consequences,\r\nto betray your father, and all in the Ark. I understand the blackguards\r\nas well as if they\'d told it all out plainly, with their tongues. They\r\nhold up avarice afore me, on one side, and fear on t\'other, and think\r\nhonesty will give way atween \'em both. But let your father and Hurry\r\nknow, \'tis all useless; as for the Sarpent, he knows it already."\r\n\r\n"But what shall I tell Judith? She will certainly send me back, if I\r\ndon\'t satisfy her mind."\r\n\r\n"Well, tell Judith the same. No doubt the savages will try the torments,\r\nto make me give in, and to revenge the loss of their warrior, but I must\r\nhold out ag\'in nat\'ral weakness in the best manner I can. You may tell\r\nJudith to feel no consarn on my account--it will come hard I know,\r\nseeing that a white man\'s gifts don\'t run to boasting and singing under\r\ntorment, for he generally feels smallest when he suffers most--but you\r\nmay tell her not to have any consarn. I think I shall make out to stand\r\nit, and she may rely on this, let me give in, as much as I may, and\r\nprove completely that I am white, by wailings, and howlings, and even\r\ntears, yet I\'ll never fall so far as to betray my fri\'nds. When it gets\r\nto burning holes in the flesh, with heated ramrods, and to hacking\r\nthe body, and tearing the hair out by the roots, natur\' may get the\r\nupperhand, so far as groans, and complaints are consarned, but there the\r\ntriumph of the vagabonds will ind; nothing short of God\'s abandoning him\r\nto the devils can make an honest man ontrue to his colour and duty."\r\n\r\nHetty listened with great attention, and her mild but speaking\r\ncountenance manifested a strong sympathy in the anticipated agony of the\r\nsupposititious sufferer. At first she seemed at a loss how to act; then,\r\ntaking a hand of Deerslayer\'s she affectionately recommended to him to\r\nborrow her Bible, and to read it while the savages were inflicting their\r\ntorments. When the other honestly admitted that it exceeded his power to\r\nread, she even volunteered to remain with him, and to perform this holy\r\noffice in person. The offer was gently declined, and Rivenoak being\r\nabout to join them, Deerslayer requested the girl to leave him, first\r\nenjoining her again to tell those in the Ark to have full confidence in\r\nhis fidelity. Hetty now walked away, and approached the group of females\r\nwith as much confidence and self-possession as if she were a native of\r\nthe tribe. On the other hand the Huron resumed his seat by the side\r\nof his prisoner, the one continuing to ask questions with all the wily\r\ningenuity of a practised Indian counsellor, and the other baffling him\r\nby the very means that are known to be the most efficacious in defeating\r\nthe finesse of the more pretending diplomacy of civilization, or by\r\nconfining his answers to the truth, and the truth only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Thus died she; never more on her\r\n    Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made\r\n    Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,\r\n    Which colder hearts endure till they are laid\r\n    By age in earth; her days and pleasure were\r\n    Brief but delightful--such as had not stayed\r\n    Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well\r\n    By the sea-shore whereon she loved to dwell."\r\n\r\n    Byron.  Don Juan, IV, lxxi.\r\n\r\nThe young men who had been sent out to reconnoitre, on the sudden\r\nappearance of Hetty, soon returned to report their want of success in\r\nmaking any discovery. One of them had even been along the beach as\r\nfar as the spot opposite to the ark, but the darkness had completely\r\nconcealed that vessel from his notice. Others had examined in different\r\ndirections, and everywhere the stillness of night was added to the\r\nsilence and solitude of the woods.\r\n\r\nIt was consequently believed that the girl had come alone, as on her\r\nformer visit, and on some similar errand. The Iroquois were ignorant\r\nthat the ark had left the castle, and there were movements projected, if\r\nnot in the course of actual execution, by this time, which also greatly\r\nadded to the sense of security. A watch was set, therefore, and all but\r\nthe sentinels disposed themselves to sleep. Sufficient care was had\r\nto the safe keeping of the captive, without inflicting on him any\r\nunnecessary suffering; and, as for Hetty, she was permitted to find a\r\nplace among the Indian girls in the best manner she could. She did\r\nnot find the friendly offices of Hist, though her character not only\r\nbestowed impunity from pain and captivity, but it procured for her a\r\nconsideration and an attention that placed her, on the score of comfort,\r\nquite on a level with the wild but gentle beings around her. She was\r\nsupplied with a skin, and made her own bed on a pile of boughs a little\r\napart from the huts. Here she was soon in a profound sleep, like all\r\naround her.\r\n\r\nThere were now thirteen men in the party, and three kept watch at a\r\ntime. One remained in shadow, not far from the fire, however. His duty\r\nwas to guard the captive, to take care that the fire neither blazed up\r\nso as to illuminate the spot, nor yet became wholly extinguished, and to\r\nkeep an eye generally on the state of the camp. Another passed from one\r\nbeach to the other, crossing the base of the point, while the third kept\r\nmoving slowly around the strand on its outer extremity, to prevent a\r\nrepetition of the surprise that had already taken place that night. This\r\narrangement was far from being usual among savages, who ordinarily\r\nrely more on the secrecy of their movements, than on vigilance of\r\nthis nature; but it had been called for by the peculiarity of the\r\ncircumstances in which the Hurons were now placed. Their position was\r\nknown to their foes, and it could not easily be changed at an hour which\r\ndemanded rest. Perhaps, too, they placed most of their confidence on the\r\nknowledge of what they believed to be passing higher up the lake, and\r\nwhich, it was thought, would fully occupy the whole of the pale-faces\r\nwho were at liberty, with their solitary Indian ally. It was also\r\nprobable Rivenoak was aware that, in holding his captive, he had in his\r\nown hands the most dangerous of all his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe precision with which those accustomed to watchfulness, or lives\r\nof disturbed rest, sleep, is not the least of the phenomena of our\r\nmysterious being. The head is no sooner on the pillow than consciousness\r\nis lost; and yet, at a necessary hour, the mind appears to arouse the\r\nbody, as promptly as if it had stood sentinel the while over it. There\r\ncan be no doubt that they who are thus roused awake by the influence\r\nof thought over matter, though the mode in which this influence is\r\nexercised must remain hidden from our curiosity until it shall be\r\nexplained, should that hour ever arrive, by the entire enlightenment of\r\nthe soul on the subject of all human mysteries. Thus it was with Hetty\r\nHutter. Feeble as the immaterial portion of her existence was thought\r\nto be, it was sufficiently active to cause her to open her eyes at\r\nmidnight. At that hour she awoke, and leaving her bed of skin and boughs\r\nshe walked innocently and openly to the embers of the fire, stirring the\r\nlatter, as the coolness of the night and the woods, in connection with\r\nan exceedingly unsophisticated bed, had a little chilled her. As the\r\nflame shot up, it lighted the swarthy countenance of the Huron on watch,\r\nwhose dark eyes glistened under its light like the balls of the panther\r\nthat is pursued to his den with burning brands. But Hetty felt no fear,\r\nand she approached the spot where the Indian stood. Her movements\r\nwere so natural, and so perfectly devoid of any of the stealthiness of\r\ncunning or deception, that he imagined she had merely arisen on account\r\nof the coolness of the night, a common occurrence in a bivouac, and the\r\none of all others, perhaps, the least likely to excite suspicion. Hetty\r\nspoke to him, but he understood no English. She then gazed near a minute\r\nat the sleeping captive, and moved slowly away in a sad and melancholy\r\nmanner. The girl took no pains to conceal her movements. Any ingenious\r\nexpedient of this nature quite likely exceeded her powers; still\r\nher step was habitually light, and scarcely audible. As she took the\r\ndirection of the extremity of the point, or the place where she had\r\nlanded in the first adventure, and where Hist had embarked, the sentinel\r\nsaw her light form gradually disappear in the gloom without uneasiness\r\nor changing his own position. He knew that others were on the look-out,\r\nand he did not believe that one who had twice come into the camp\r\nvoluntarily, and had already left it openly, would take refuge in\r\nflight. In short, the conduct of the girl excited no more attention\r\nthat that of any person of feeble intellect would excite in civilized\r\nsociety, while her person met with more consideration and respect.\r\n\r\nHetty certainly had no very distinct notions of the localities, but she\r\nfound her way to the beach, which she reached on the same side of the\r\npoint as that on which the camp had been made. By following the margin\r\nof the water, taking a northern direction, she soon encountered the\r\nIndian who paced the strand as sentinel. This was a young warrior, and\r\nwhen he heard her light tread coming along the gravel he approached\r\nswiftly, though with anything but menace in his manner. The darkness was\r\nso intense that it was not easy to discover forms within the shadows\r\nof the woods at the distance of twenty feet, and quite impossible to\r\ndistinguish persons until near enough to touch them. The young Huron\r\nmanifested disappointment when he found whom he had met; for, truth to\r\nsay, he was expecting his favourite, who had promised to relieve the\r\nennui of a midnight watch with her presence. This man was also ignorant\r\nof English, but he was at no loss to understand why the girl should be\r\nup at that hour. Such things were usual in an Indian village and camp,\r\nwhere sleep is as irregular as the meals. Then poor Hetty\'s known\r\nimbecility, as in most things connected with the savages, stood her\r\nfriend on this occasion. Vexed at his disappointment, and impatient of\r\nthe presence of one he thought an intruder, the young warrior signed\r\nfor the girl to move forward, holding the direction of the beach. Hetty\r\ncomplied; but as she walked away she spoke aloud in English in her usual\r\nsoft tones, which the stillness of the night made audible at some little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n"If you took me for a Huron girl, warrior," she said, "I don\'t wonder\r\nyou are so little pleased. I am Hetty Hutter, Thomas Hutter\'s daughter,\r\nand have never met any man at night, for mother always said it was\r\nwrong, and modest young women should never do it; modest young women of\r\nthe pale-faces, I mean; for customs are different in different parts\r\nof the world, I know. No, no; I\'m Hetty Hutter, and wouldn\'t meet even\r\nHurry Harry, though he should fall down on his knees and ask me! Mother\r\nsaid it was wrong."\r\n\r\nBy the time Hetty had said this, she reached the place where the canoes\r\nhad come ashore, and, owing to the curvature of the land and the bushes,\r\nwould have been completely hid from the sight of the sentinel, had it\r\nbeen broad day. But another footstep had caught the lover\'s ear, and he\r\nwas already nearly beyond the sound of the girl\'s silvery voice. Still\r\nHetty, bent only on her own thoughts and purposes, continued to speak,\r\nthough the gentleness of her tones prevented the sounds from penetrating\r\nfar into the woods. On the water they were more widely diffused.\r\n\r\n"Here I am, Judith," she added, "and there is no one near me. The Huron\r\non watch has gone to meet his sweetheart, who is an Indian girl you\r\nknow, and never had a Christian mother to tell her how wrong it is to\r\nmeet a man at night."\r\n\r\nHetty\'s voice was hushed by a "Hist!" that came from the water, and then\r\nshe caught a dim view of the canoe, which approached noiselessly, and\r\nsoon grated on the shingle with its bow. The moment the weight of Hetty\r\nwas felt in the light craft the canoe withdrew, stern foremost, as if\r\npossessed of life and volition, until it was a hundred yards from the\r\nshore. Then it turned and, making a wide sweep, as much to prolong the\r\npassage as to get beyond the sound of voices, it held its way towards\r\nthe ark. For several minutes nothing was uttered; but, believing herself\r\nto be in a favourable position to confer with her sister, Judith, who\r\nalone sat in the stern, managing the canoe with a skill little short of\r\nthat of a man, began a discourse which she had been burning to commence\r\never since they had quitted the point.\r\n\r\n"Here we are safe, Hetty," she said, "and may talk without the fear of\r\nbeing overheard. You must speak low, however, for sounds are heard far\r\non the water in a still night. I was so close to the point some of the\r\ntime while you were on it, that I have heard the voices of the warriors,\r\nand I heard your shoes on the gravel of the beach, even before you\r\nspoke."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe, Judith, the Hurons know I have left them."\r\n\r\n"Quite likely they do not, for a lover makes a poor sentry, unless it be\r\nto watch for his sweetheart! But tell me, Hetty, did you see and speak\r\nwith Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--there he was seated near the fire, with his legs tied, though\r\nthey left his arms free, to move them as he pleased."\r\n\r\n"Well, what did he tell you, child? Speak quick; I am dying to know what\r\nmessage he sent me."\r\n\r\n"What did he tell me? why, what do you think, Judith; he told me that he\r\ncouldn\'t read! Only think of that! a white man, and not know how to read\r\nhis Bible even! He never could have had a mother, sister!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that, Hetty. All men can\'t read; though mother knew so much\r\nand taught us so much, father knows very little about books, and he can\r\nbarely read the Bible you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I never thought fathers could read much, but mothers ought all\r\nto read, else how can they teach their children? Depend on it, Judith,\r\nDeerslayer could never have had a mother, else he would know how to\r\nread."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him I sent you ashore, Hetty, and how much concern I feel\r\nfor his misfortune?" asked the other, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I believe I did, Judith; but you know I am feeble-minded, and I may\r\nhave forgotten. I did tell him you brought me ashore. And he told me a\r\ngreat deal that I was to say to you, which I remember well, for it made\r\nmy blood run cold to hear him. He told me to say that his friends--I\r\nsuppose you are one of them, sister?"\r\n\r\n"How can you torment me thus, Hetty! Certainly, I am one of the truest\r\nfriends he has on earth."\r\n\r\n"Torment you! yes, now I remember all about it. I am glad you used that\r\nword, Judith, for it brings it all back to my mind. Well, he said\r\nhe might be tormented by the savages, but he would try to bear it as\r\nbecomes a Christian white man, and that no one need be afeard--why does\r\nDeerslayer call it afeard, when mother always taught us to say afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, dear Hetty, never mind that, now," cried the other, almost\r\ngasping for breath. "Did Deerslayer really tell you that he thought the\r\nsavages would put him to the torture? Recollect now, well, Hetty, for\r\nthis is a most awful and serious thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes he did; and I remember it by your speaking about my tormenting you.\r\nOh! I felt very sorry for him, and Deerslayer took all so quietly and\r\nwithout noise! Deerslayer is not as handsome as Hurry Harry, Judith, but\r\nhe is more quiet."\r\n\r\n"He\'s worth a million Hurrys! yes, he\'s worth all the young men who\r\never came upon the lake put together," said Judith, with an energy and\r\npositiveness that caused her sister to wonder. "He is true. There is no\r\nlie about Deerslayer. You, Hetty, may not know what a merit it is in a\r\nman to have truth, but when you get--no--I hope you will never know\r\nit. Why should one like you be ever made to learn the hard lesson to\r\ndistrust and hate!"\r\n\r\nJudith bowed her face, dark as it was, and unseen as she must have been\r\nby any eye but that of Omniscience, between her hands, and groaned. This\r\nsudden paroxysm of feeling, however, lasted but for a moment, and she\r\ncontinued more calmly, still speaking frankly to her sister, whose\r\nintelligence, and whose discretion in any thing that related to herself,\r\nshe did not in the least distrust. Her voice, however, was low and\r\nhusky, instead of having its former clearness and animation.\r\n\r\n"It is a hard thing to fear truth, Hetty," she said, "and yet do I more\r\ndread Deerslayer\'s truth, than any enemy! One cannot tamper with such\r\ntruth--so much honesty--such obstinate uprightness! But we are not\r\naltogether unequal, sister--Deerslayer and I? He is not altogether my\r\nsuperior?"\r\n\r\nIt was not usual for Judith so far to demean herself as to appeal to\r\nHetty\'s judgment. Nor did she often address her by the title of sister,\r\na distinction that is commonly given by the junior to the senior, even\r\nwhere there is perfect equality in all other respects. As trifling\r\ndepartures from habitual deportment oftener strike the imagination than\r\nmore important changes, Hetty perceived the circumstances, and wondered\r\nat them in her own simple way. Her ambition was a little quickened,\r\nand the answer was as much out of the usual course of things as the\r\nquestion; the poor girl attempting to refine beyond her strength.\r\n\r\n"Superior, Judith!" she repeated with pride. "In what can Deerslayer\r\nbe your superior? Are you not mother\'s child--and does he know how to\r\nread--and wasn\'t mother before any woman in all this part of the world?\r\nI should think, so far from supposing himself your superior, he would\r\nhardly believe himself mine. You are handsome, and he is ugly--"\r\n\r\n"No, not ugly, Hetty," interrupted Judith. "Only plain. But his honest\r\nface has a look in it that is far better than beauty. In my eyes,\r\nDeerslayer is handsomer than Hurry Harry."\r\n\r\n"Judith Hutter! you frighten me. Hurry is the handsomest mortal in the\r\nworld--even handsomer than you are yourself; because a man\'s good looks,\r\nyou know, are always better than a woman\'s good looks."\r\n\r\nThis little innocent touch of natural taste did not please the elder\r\nsister at the moment, and she did not scruple to betray it. "Hetty, you\r\nnow speak foolishly, and had better say no more on this subject," she\r\nanswered. "Hurry is not the handsomest mortal in the world, by many;\r\nand there are officers in the garrisons--" Judith stammered at the\r\nwords--"there are officers in the garrisons, near us, far comelier than\r\nhe. But why do you think me the equal of Deerslayer--speak of that, for\r\nI do not like to hear you show so much admiration of a man like Hurry\r\nHarry, who has neither feelings, manners, nor conscience. You are too\r\ngood for him, and he ought to be told it, at once."\r\n\r\n"I! Judith, how you forget! Why I am not beautiful, and am\r\nfeeble-minded."\r\n\r\n"You are good, Hetty, and that is more than can be said of Harry March.\r\nHe may have a face, and a body, but he has no heart. But enough of this,\r\nfor the present. Tell me what raises me to an equality with Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"To think of you asking me this, Judith! He can\'t read, and you can. He\r\ndon\'t know how to talk, but speaks worse than Hurry even;--for, sister,\r\nHarry doesn\'t always pronounce his words right! Did you ever notice\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, he is as coarse in speech as in everything else. But I fear\r\nyou flatter me, Hetty, when you think I can be justly called the equal\r\nof a man like Deerslayer. It is true, I have been better taught; in\r\none sense am more comely; and perhaps might look higher; but then his\r\ntruth--his truth--makes a fearful difference between us! Well, I will\r\ntalk no more of this; and we will bethink us of the means of getting\r\nhim out of the hands of the Hurons. We have father\'s chest in the ark,\r\nHetty, and might try the temptation of more elephants; though I fear\r\nsuch baubles will not buy the liberty of a man like Deerslayer. I am\r\nafraid father and Hurry will not be as willing to ransom Deerslayer, as\r\nDeerslayer was to ransom them!"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Judith? Hurry and Deerslayer are friends, and friends should\r\nalways help one another."\r\n\r\n"Alas! poor Hetty, you little know mankind! Seeming friends are often\r\nmore to be dreaded than open enemies; particularly by females. But\r\nyou\'ll have to land in the morning, and try again what can be done for\r\nDeerslayer. Tortured he shall not be, while Judith Hutter lives, and can\r\nfind means to prevent it."\r\n\r\nThe conversation now grew desultory, and was drawn out, until the\r\nelder sister had extracted from the younger every fact that the feeble\r\nfaculties of the latter permitted her to retain, and to communicate.\r\nWhen Judith was satisfied--though she could never be said to be\r\nsatisfied, whose feelings seemed to be so interwoven with all that\r\nrelated to the subject, as to have excited a nearly inappeasable\r\ncuriosity--but, when Judith could think of no more questions to ask,\r\nwithout resorting to repetition, the canoe was paddled towards the scow.\r\nThe intense darkness of the night, and the deep shadows which the\r\nhills and forest cast upon the water, rendered it difficult to find the\r\nvessel, anchored, as it had been, as close to the shore as a regard to\r\nsafety rendered prudent. Judith was expert in the management of a bark\r\ncanoe, the lightness of which demanded skill rather than strength; and\r\nshe forced her own little vessel swiftly over the water, the moment she\r\nhad ended her conference with Hetty, and had come to the determination\r\nto return. Still no ark was seen. Several times the sisters fancied they\r\nsaw it, looming up in the obscurity, like a low black rock; but on each\r\noccasion it was found to be either an optical illusion, or some swell of\r\nthe foliage on the shore. After a search that lasted half an hour, the\r\ngirls were forced to the unwelcome conviction that the ark had departed.\r\nMost young women would have felt the awkwardness of their situation,\r\nin a physical sense, under the circumstances in which the sisters were\r\nleft, more than any apprehensions of a different nature. Not so with\r\nJudith, however; and even Hetty felt more concern about the motives that\r\nmight have influenced her father and Hurry, than any fears for her own\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be, Hetty," said Judith, when a thorough search had satisfied\r\nthem both that no ark was to be found; "it cannot be that the Indians\r\nhave rafted, or swum off and surprised our friends as they slept?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that Hist and Chingachgook would sleep until they had\r\ntold each other all they had to say after so long a separation--do you,\r\nsister?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, child. There was much to keep them awake, but one Indian\r\nmay have been surprised even when not asleep, especially as his thoughts\r\nmay have been on other things. Still we should have heard a noise; for\r\nin a night like this, an oath of Hurry Harry\'s would have echoed in the\r\neastern hills like a clap of thunder."\r\n\r\n"Hurry is sinful and thoughtless about his words, Judith," Hetty meekly\r\nand sorrowfully answered.\r\n\r\n"No--no; \'tis impossible the ark could be taken and I not hear the\r\nnoise. It is not an hour since I left it, and the whole time I have been\r\nattentive to the smallest sound. And yet, it is not easy to believe a\r\nfather would willingly abandon his children!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps father has thought us in our cabin asleep, Judith, and has\r\nmoved away to go home. You know we often move the ark in the night."\r\n\r\n"This is true, Hetty, and it must be as you suppose. There is a little\r\nmore southern air than there was, and they have gone up the lake--"\r\nJudith stopped, for, as the last word was on her tongue, the scene was\r\nsuddenly lighted, though only for a single instant, by a flash. The\r\ncrack of a rifle succeeded, and then followed the roll of the echo along\r\nthe eastern mountains. Almost at the same moment a piercing female\r\ncry rose in the air in a prolonged shriek. The awful stillness that\r\nsucceeded was, if possible, more appalling than the fierce and sudden\r\ninterruption of the deep silence of midnight. Resolute as she was both\r\nby nature and habit, Judith scarce breathed, while poor Hetty hid her\r\nface and trembled.\r\n\r\n"That was a woman\'s cry, Hetty," said the former solemnly, "and it was\r\na cry of anguish! If the ark has moved from this spot it can only have\r\ngone north with this air, and the gun and shriek came from the point.\r\nCan any thing have befallen Hist?"\r\n\r\n"Let us go and see, Judith; she may want our assistance--for, besides\r\nherself, there are none but men in the ark."\r\n\r\nIt was not a moment for hesitation, and ere Judith had ceased speaking\r\nher paddle was in the water. The distance to the point, in a direct\r\nline, was not great, and the impulses under which the girls worked were\r\ntoo exciting to allow them to waste the precious moments in useless\r\nprecautions. They paddled incautiously for them, but the same excitement\r\nkept others from noting their movements. Presently a glare of light\r\ncaught the eye of Judith through an opening in the bushes, and steering\r\nby it, she so directed the canoe as to keep it visible, while she got as\r\nnear the land as was either prudent or necessary.\r\n\r\nThe scene that was now presented to the observation of the girls was\r\nwithin the woods, on the side of the declivity so often mentioned, and\r\nin plain view from the boat. Here all in the camp were collected, some\r\nsix or eight carrying torches of fat-pine, which cast a strong but\r\nfunereal light on all beneath the arches of the forest. With her\r\nback supported against a tree, and sustained on one side by the young\r\nsentinel whose remissness had suffered Hetty to escape, sat the female\r\nwhose expected visit had produced his delinquency. By the glare of the\r\ntorch that was held near her face, it was evident that she was in the\r\nagonies of death, while the blood that trickled from her bared bosom\r\nbetrayed the nature of the injury she had received. The pungent,\r\npeculiar smell of gunpowder, too, was still quite perceptible in the\r\nheavy, damp night air. There could be no question that she had been\r\nshot. Judith understood it all at a glance. The streak of light had\r\nappeared on the water a short distance from the point, and either the\r\nrifle had been discharged from a canoe hovering near the land, or it had\r\nbeen fired from the ark in passing. An incautious exclamation, or laugh,\r\nmay have produced the assault, for it was barely possible that the aim\r\nhad been assisted by any other agent than sound. As to the effect, that\r\nwas soon still more apparent, the head of the victim dropping, and the\r\nbody sinking in death. Then all the torches but one were extinguished--a\r\nmeasure of prudence; and the melancholy train that bore the body to the\r\ncamp was just to be distinguished by the glimmering light that remained.\r\nJudith sighed heavily and shuddered, as her paddle again dipped, and\r\nthe canoe moved cautiously around the point. A sight had afflicted her\r\nsenses, and now haunted her imagination, that was still harder to be\r\nborne, than even the untimely fate and passing agony of the deceased\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nShe had seen, under the strong glare of all the torches, the erect form\r\nof Deerslayer, standing with commiseration, and as she thought, with\r\nshame depicted on his countenance, near the dying female. He betrayed\r\nneither fear nor backwardness himself; but it was apparent by the\r\nglances cast at him by the warriors, that fierce passions were\r\nstruggling in their bosoms. All this seemed to be unheeded by the\r\ncaptive, but it remained impressed on the memory of Judith throughout\r\nthe night. No canoe was met hovering near the point. A stillness and\r\ndarkness, as complete as if the silence of the forest had never been\r\ndisturbed, or the sun had never shone on that retired region, now\r\nreigned on the point, and on the gloomy water, the slumbering woods,\r\nand even the murky sky. No more could be done, therefore, than to seek\r\na place of safety; and this was only to be found in the centre of the\r\nlake. Paddling in silence to that spot, the canoe was suffered to drift\r\nnortherly, while the girls sought such repose as their situation and\r\nfeelings would permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Stand to your arms, and guard the door--all\'s lost\r\n    Unless that fearful bell be silenced soon.\r\n    The officer hath miss\'d his path, or purpose,\r\n    Or met some unforeseen and hideous obstacle.\r\n    Anselmo, with thy company proceed\r\n    Straight to the tower; the rest remain with me."\r\n\r\n    Byron, Marino Faliero, IV.ii.230-35.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture of Judith Hutter, concerning the manner in which the\r\nIndian girl had met her death, was accurate in the main. After sleeping\r\nseveral hours, her father and March awoke. This occurred a few minutes\r\nafter she had left the Ark to go in quest of her sister, and when of\r\ncourse Chingachgook and his betrothed were on board. From the Delaware\r\nthe old man learned the position of the camp, and the recent events, as\r\nwell as the absence of his daughters. The latter gave him no concern,\r\nfor he relied greatly on the sagacity of the elder, and the known\r\nimpunity with which the younger passed among the savages. Long\r\nfamiliarity with danger, too, had blunted his sensibilities. Nor did he\r\nseem much to regret the captivity of Deerslayer, for, while he knew how\r\nmaterial his aid might be in a defence, the difference in their views on\r\nthe morality of the woods, had not left much sympathy between them. He\r\nwould have rejoiced to know the position of the camp before it had been\r\nalarmed by the escape of Hist, but it would be too hazardous now to\r\nventure to land, and he reluctantly relinquished for the night the\r\nruthless designs that cupidity and revenge had excited him to entertain.\r\nIn this mood Hutter took a seat in the head of the scow, where he\r\nwas quickly joined by Hurry, leaving the Serpent and Hist in quiet\r\npossession of the other extremity of the vessel.\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer has shown himself a boy, in going among the savages at this\r\nhour, and letting himself fall into their hands like a deer that tumbles\r\ninto a pit," growled the old man, perceiving as usual the mote in his\r\nneighbor\'s eyes, while he overlooked the beam in his own; "if he is left\r\nto pay for his stupidity with his own flesh, he can blame no one but\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way of the world, old Tom," returned Hurry. "Every man must\r\nmeet his own debts, and answer for his own sins. I\'m amazed, howsever,\r\nthat a lad as skilful and watchful as Deerslayer should have been caught\r\nin such a trap! Didn\'t he know any better than to go prowling about a\r\nHuron camp at midnight, with no place to retreat to but a lake? or did\r\nhe think himself a buck, that by taking to the water could throw off the\r\nscent and swim himself out of difficulty? I had a better opinion of the\r\nboy\'s judgment, I\'ll own; but we must overlook a little ignorance in a\r\nraw hand. I say, Master Hutter, do you happen to know what has become of\r\nthe gals--I see no signs of Judith, or Hetty, though I\'ve been through\r\nthe Ark, and looked into all its living creatur\'s."\r\n\r\nHutter briefly explained the manner in which his daughters had taken to\r\nthe canoe, as it had been related by the Delaware, as well as the return\r\nof Judith after landing her sister, and her second departure.\r\n\r\n"This comes of a smooth tongue, Floating Tom," exclaimed Hurry, grating\r\nhis teeth in pure resentment--"This comes of a smooth tongue, and a\r\nsilly gal\'s inclinations, and you had best look into the matter! You and\r\nI were both prisoners--" Hurry could recall that circumstance now--"you\r\nand I were both prisoners and yet Judith never stirred an inch to do us\r\nany sarvice! She is bewitched with this lank-looking Deerslayer, and he,\r\nand she, and you, and all of us, had best look to it. I am not a man to\r\nput up with such a wrong quietly, and I say, all the parties had best\r\nlook to it! Let\'s up kedge, old fellow, and move nearer to this p\'int,\r\nand see how matters are getting on."\r\n\r\nHutter had no objections to this movement, and the Ark was got under\r\nway in the usual manner; care being taken to make no noise. The wind was\r\npassing northward, and the sail soon swept the scow so far up the lake\r\nas to render the dark outlines of the trees that clothed the point dimly\r\nvisible. Floating Tom steered, and he sailed along as near the land as\r\nthe depth of the water and the overhanging branches would allow. It was\r\nimpossible to distinguish anything that stood within the shadows of the\r\nshore, but the forms of the sail and of the hut were discerned by the\r\nyoung sentinel on the beach, who has already been mentioned. In the\r\nmoment of sudden surprise, a deep Indian exclamation escaped him. In\r\nthat spirit of recklessness and ferocity that formed the essence of\r\nHurry\'s character, this man dropped his rifle and fired. The ball was\r\nsped by accident, or by that overruling providence which decides the\r\nfates of all, and the girl fell. Then followed the scene with the\r\ntorches, which has just been described.\r\n\r\nAt the precise moment when Hurry committed this act of unthinking\r\ncruelty, the canoe of Judith was within a hundred feet of the spot from\r\nwhich the Ark had so lately moved. Her own course has been described,\r\nand it has now become our office to follow that of her father and his\r\ncompanions. The shriek announced the effects of the random shot of\r\nMarch, and it also proclaimed that the victim was a woman. Hurry himself\r\nwas startled at these unlooked for consequences, and for a moment he\r\nwas sorely disturbed by conflicting sensations. At first he laughed, in\r\nreckless and rude-minded exultation; and then conscience, that monitor\r\nplanted in our breasts by God, and which receives its more general\r\ngrowth from the training bestowed in the tillage of childhood, shot a\r\npang to his heart. For a minute, the mind of this creature equally of\r\ncivilization and of barbarism, was a sort of chaos as to feeling, not\r\nknowing what to think of its own act; and then the obstinacy and pride\r\nof one of his habits, interposed to assert their usual ascendency. He\r\nstruck the butt of his rifle on the bottom of the scow, with a species\r\nof defiance, and began to whistle a low air with an affectation of\r\nindifference. All this time the Ark was in motion, and it was already\r\nopening the bay above the point, and was consequently quitting the land.\r\n\r\nHurry\'s companions did not view his conduct with the same indulgence\r\nas that with which he appeared disposed to regard it himself. Hutter\r\ngrowled out his dissatisfaction, for the act led to no advantage, while\r\nit threatened to render the warfare more vindictive than ever, and none\r\ncensure motiveless departures from the right more severely than the\r\nmercenary and unprincipled. Still he commanded himself, the captivity\r\nof Deerslayer rendering the arm of the offender of double consequence\r\nto him at that moment. Chingachgook arose, and for a single instant the\r\nancient animosity of tribes was forgotten, in a feeling of colour;\r\nbut he recollected himself in season to prevent any of the fierce\r\nconsequences that, for a passing moment, he certainly meditated. Not so\r\nwith Hist. Rushing through the hut, or cabin, the girl stood at the side\r\nof Hurry, almost as soon as his rifle touched the bottom of the scow,\r\nand with a fearlessness that did credit to her heart, she poured out her\r\nreproaches with the generous warmth of a woman.\r\n\r\n"What for you shoot?" she said. "What Huron gal do, dat you kill him?\r\nWhat you t\'ink Manitou say? What you t\'ink Manitou feel? What Iroquois\r\ndo? No get honour--no get camp--no get prisoner--no get battle--no get\r\nscalp--no get not\'ing at all! Blood come after blood! How you feel, your\r\nwife killed? Who pity you, when tear come for moder, or sister? You big\r\nas great pine--Huron gal little slender birch--why you fall on her and\r\ncrush her? You t\'ink Huron forget it? No; red-skin never forget! Never\r\nforget friend; never forget enemy. Red man Manitou in dat. Why you so\r\nwicked, great pale-face?"\r\n\r\nHurry had never been so daunted as by this close and warm attack of the\r\nIndian girl. It is true that she had a powerful ally in his conscience,\r\nand while she spoke earnestly, it was in tones so feminine as to deprive\r\nhim of any pretext for unmanly anger. The softness of her voice added\r\nto the weight of her remonstrance, by lending to the latter an air of\r\npurity and truth. Like most vulgar minded men, he had only regarded the\r\nIndians through the medium of their coarser and fiercer characteristics.\r\nIt had never struck him that the affections are human, that even high\r\nprinciples--modified by habits and prejudices, but not the less elevated\r\nwithin their circle--can exist in the savage state, and that the\r\nwarrior who is most ruthless in the field, can submit to the softest and\r\ngentlest influences in the moments of domestic quiet. In a word, it\r\nwas the habit of his mind to regard all Indians as being only a slight\r\ndegree removed from the wild beasts that roamed the woods, and to\r\nfeel disposed to treat them accordingly, whenever interest or caprice\r\nsupplied a motive or an impulse. Still, though daunted by these\r\nreproaches, the handsome barbarian could hardly be said to be penitent.\r\nHe was too much rebuked by conscience to suffer an outbreak of temper\r\nto escape him, and perhaps he felt that he had already committed an act\r\nthat might justly bring his manhood in question. Instead of resenting,\r\nor answering the simple but natural appeal of Hist, he walked away, like\r\none who disdained entering into a controversy with a woman.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the Ark swept onward, and by the time the scene with\r\nthe torches was enacting beneath the trees, it had reached the open\r\nlake, Floating Tom causing it to sheer further from the land with a\r\nsort of instinctive dread of retaliation. An hour now passed in gloomy\r\nsilence, no one appearing disposed to break it. Hist had retired to her\r\npallet, and Chingachgook lay sleeping in the forward part of the scow.\r\nHutter and Hurry alone remained awake, the former at the steering oar,\r\nwhile the latter brooded over his own conduct, with the stubbornness of\r\none little given to a confession of his errors, and the secret goadings\r\nof the worm that never dies. This was at the moment when Judith and\r\nHetty reached the centre of the lake, and had lain down to endeavor to\r\nsleep in their drifting canoe.\r\n\r\nThe night was calm, though so much obscured by clouds. The season was\r\nnot one of storms, and those which did occur in the month of June, on\r\nthat embedded water, though frequently violent were always of short\r\ncontinuance. Nevertheless, there was the usual current of heavy, damp\r\nnight air, which, passing over the summits of the trees, scarcely\r\nappeared to descend as low as the surface of the glassy lake, but kept\r\nmoving a short distance above it, saturated with the humidity that\r\nconstantly arose from the woods, and apparently never proceeding far in\r\nany one direction. The currents were influenced by the formation of the\r\nhills, as a matter of course, a circumstance that rendered even fresh\r\nbreezes baffling, and which reduced the feebler efforts of the night\r\nair to be a sort of capricious and fickle sighings of the woods. Several\r\ntimes the head of the Ark pointed east, and once it was actually turned\r\ntowards the south, again; but, on the whole, it worked its way north;\r\nHutter making always a fair wind, if wind it could be called, his\r\nprincipal motive appearing to keep in motion, in order to defeat any\r\ntreacherous design of his enemies. He now felt some little concern about\r\nhis daughters, and perhaps as much about the canoe; but, on the whole,\r\nthis uncertainty did not much disturb him, as he had the reliance\r\nalready mentioned on the intelligence of Judith.\r\n\r\nIt was the season of the shortest nights, and it was not long before the\r\ndeep obscurity which precedes the day began to yield to the returning\r\nlight. If any earthly scene could be presented to the senses of man that\r\nmight soothe his passions and temper his ferocity, it was that which\r\ngrew upon the eyes of Hutter and Hurry as the hours advanced, changing\r\nnight to morning. There were the usual soft tints of the sky, in which\r\nneither the gloom of darkness nor the brilliancy of the sun prevails,\r\nand under which objects appear more unearthly, and we might add holy,\r\nthan at any other portion of the twenty four hours. The beautiful and\r\nsoothing calm of eventide has been extolled by a thousand poets, and yet\r\nit does not bring with it the far-reaching and sublime thoughts of the\r\nhalf hour that precedes the rising of a summer sun. In the one case the\r\npanorama is gradually hid from the sight, while in the other its objects\r\nstart out from the unfolding picture, first dim and misty; then marked\r\nin, in solemn background; next seen in the witchery of an increasing, a\r\nthing as different as possible from the decreasing twilight, and finally\r\nmellow, distinct and luminous, as the rays of the great centre of light\r\ndiffuse themselves in the atmosphere. The hymns of birds, too, have\r\nno moral counterpart in the retreat to the roost, or the flight to the\r\nnest, and these invariably accompany the advent of the day, until the\r\nappearance of the sun itself--\r\n\r\n"Bathes in deep joy, the land and sea."\r\n\r\nAll this, however, Hutter and Hurry witnessed without experiencing any\r\nof that calm delight which the spectacle is wont to bring, when the\r\nthoughts are just and the aspirations pure. They not only witnessed\r\nit, but they witnessed it under circumstances that had a tendency to\r\nincrease its power, and to heighten its charms. Only one solitary object\r\nbecame visible in the returning light that had received its form or uses\r\nfrom human taste or human desires, which as often deform as beautify\r\na landscape. This was the castle, all the rest being native, and fresh\r\nfrom the hand of God. That singular residence, too, was in keeping with\r\nthe natural objects of the view, starting out from the gloom, quaint,\r\npicturesque and ornamental. Nevertheless the whole was lost on the\r\nobservers, who knew no feeling of poetry, had lost their sense of\r\nnatural devotion in lives of obdurate and narrow selfishness, and had\r\nlittle other sympathy with nature, than that which originated with her\r\nlowest wants.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the light was sufficiently strong to allow of a distinct view\r\nof the lake, and more particularly of its shores, Hutter turned the head\r\nof the Ark directly towards the castle, with the avowed intention of\r\ntaking possession, for the day at least, as the place most favorable\r\nfor meeting his daughters and for carrying on his operations against the\r\nIndians. By this time, Chingachgook was up, and Hist was heard stirring\r\namong the furniture of the kitchen. The place for which they steered was\r\ndistant only a mile, and the air was sufficiently favorable to permit it\r\nto be reached by means of the sail. At this moment, too, to render the\r\nappearances generally auspicious, the canoe of Judith was seen floating\r\nnorthward in the broadest part of the lake; having actually passed the\r\nscow in the darkness, in obedience to no other power than that of the\r\nelements. Hutter got his glass, and took a long and anxious survey, to\r\nascertain if his daughters were in the light craft or not, and a slight\r\nexclamation like that of joy escaped him, as he caught a glimpse of what\r\nhe rightly conceived to be a part of Judith\'s dress above the top of the\r\ncanoe. At the next instant the girl arose and was seen gazing about her,\r\nlike one assuring herself of her situation. A minute later, Hetty was\r\nseen on her knees in the other end of the canoe, repeating the prayers\r\nthat had been taught her in childhood by a misguided but repentant\r\nmother. As Hutter laid down the glass, still drawn to its focus, the\r\nSerpent raised it to his eye and turned it towards the canoe. It was the\r\nfirst time he had ever used such an instrument, and Hist understood\r\nby his "Hugh!," the expression of his face, and his entire mien, that\r\nsomething wonderful had excited his admiration. It is well known that\r\nthe American Indians, more particularly those of superior characters and\r\nstations, singularly maintain their self-possession and stoicism, in\r\nthe midst of the flood of marvels that present themselves in their\r\noccasional visits to the abodes of civilization, and Chingachgook had\r\nimbibed enough of this impassibility to suppress any very undignified\r\nmanifestation of surprise. With Hist, however, no such law was binding,\r\nand when her lover managed to bring the glass in a line with the canoe,\r\nand her eye was applied to the smaller end, the girl started back in\r\nalarm; then she clapped her hands with delight, and a laugh, the usual\r\nattendant of untutored admiration, followed. A few minutes sufficed to\r\nenable this quick witted girl to manage the instrument for herself, and\r\nshe directed it at every prominent object that struck her fancy. Finding\r\na rest in one of the windows, she and the Delaware first surveyed the\r\nlake; then the shores, the hills, and, finally, the castle attracted\r\ntheir attention. After a long steady gaze at the latter, Hist took away\r\nher eye, and spoke to her lover in a low, earnest manner. Chingachgook\r\nimmediately placed his eye to the glass, and his look even exceeded that\r\nof his betrothed in length and intensity. Again they spoke together,\r\nconfidentially, appearing to compare opinions, after which the glass was\r\nlaid aside, and the young warrior quitted the cabin to join Hutter and\r\nHurry.\r\n\r\nThe Ark was slowly but steadily advancing, and the castle was materially\r\nwithin half a mile, when Chingachgook joined the two white men in\r\nthe stern of the scow. His manner was calm, but it was evident to the\r\nothers, who were familiar with the habits of the Indians, that he had\r\nsomething to communicate. Hurry was generally prompt to speak and,\r\naccording to custom, he took the lead on this occasion.\r\n\r\n"Out with it, red-skin," he cried, in his usual rough manner. "Have you\r\ndiscovered a chipmunk in a tree, or is there a salmon-trout swimming\r\nunder the bottom of the scow? You find what a pale-face can do in the\r\nway of eyes, now, Sarpent, and mustn\'t wonder that they can see the land\r\nof the Indians from afar off."\r\n\r\n"No good to go to Castle," put in Chingachgook with emphasis, the moment\r\nthe other gave him an opportunity of speaking. "Huron there."\r\n\r\n"The devil he is!--If this should turn out to be true, Floating Tom,\r\na pretty trap were we about to pull down on our heads! Huron,\r\nthere!--Well, this may be so; but no signs can I see of any thing, near\r\nor about the old hut, but logs, water, and bark--bating two or three\r\nwindows, and one door."\r\n\r\nHutter called for the glass, and took a careful survey of the spot,\r\nbefore he ventured an opinion, at all; then he somewhat cavalierly\r\nexpressed his dissent from that given by the Indian.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got this glass wrong end foremost, Delaware," continued Hurry.\r\n"Neither the old man nor I can see any trail in the lake."\r\n\r\n"No trail--water make no trail," said Hist, eagerly. "Stop boat--no go\r\ntoo near. Huron there!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s it!--Stick to the same tale, and more people will believe\r\nyou. I hope, Sarpent, you and your gal will agree in telling the same\r\nstory arter marriage, as well as you do now. \'Huron, there!\'--Whereabouts\r\nis he to be seen--in the padlock, or the chains, or the logs. There\r\nisn\'t a gaol in the colony that has a more lock up look about it, than\r\nold Tom\'s chiente, and I know something about gaols from exper\'ence."\r\n\r\n"No see moccasin," said Hist, impatiently "why no look--and see him."\r\n\r\n"Give me the glass, Harry," interrupted Hutter, "and lower the sail.\r\nIt is seldom that an Indian woman meddles, and when she does, there is\r\ngenerally a cause for it. There is, truly, a moccasin floating against\r\none of the piles, and it may or may not be a sign that the castle hasn\'t\r\nescaped visitors in our absence. Moccasins are no rarities, however, for\r\nI wear \'em myself; and Deerslayer wears \'em, and you wear \'em, March,\r\nand, for that matter so does Hetty, quite as often as she wears shoes,\r\nthough I never yet saw Judith trust her pretty foot in a moccasin."\r\n\r\nHurry had lowered the sail, and by this time the Ark was within two\r\nhundred yards of the castle, setting in, nearer and nearer, each moment,\r\nbut at a rate too slow to excite any uneasiness. Each now took the glass\r\nin turn, and the castle, and every thing near it, was subjected to a\r\nscrutiny still more rigid than ever. There the moccasin lay, beyond a\r\nquestion, floating so lightly, and preserving its form so well, that it\r\nwas scarcely wet. It had caught by a piece of the rough bark of one of\r\nthe piles, on the exterior of the water-palisade that formed the dock\r\nalready mentioned, which circumstance alone prevented it from drifting\r\naway before the air. There were many modes, however, of accounting for\r\nthe presence of the moccasin, without supposing it to have been dropped\r\nby an enemy. It might have fallen from the platform, even while Hutter\r\nwas in possession of the place, and drifted to the spot where it was now\r\nseen, remaining unnoticed until detected by the acute vision of Hist.\r\nIt might have drifted from a distance, up or down the lake, and\r\naccidentally become attached to the pile, or palisade. It might have\r\nbeen thrown from a window, and alighted in that particular place; or it\r\nmight certainly have fallen from a scout, or an assailant, during the\r\npast night, who was obliged to abandon it to the lake, in the deep\r\nobscurity which then prevailed.\r\n\r\nAll these conjectures passed from Hutter to Hurry, the former appearing\r\ndisposed to regard the omen as a little sinister, while the latter\r\ntreated it with his usual reckless disdain. As for the Indian, he was of\r\nopinion that the moccasin should be viewed as one would regard a\r\ntrail in the woods, which might, or might not, equally, prove to be\r\nthreatening. Hist, however, had something available to propose. She\r\ndeclared her readiness to take a canoe, to proceed to the palisade and\r\nbring away the moccasin, when its ornaments would show whether it came\r\nfrom the Canadas or not. Both the white men were disposed to accept\r\nthis offer, but the Delaware interfered to prevent the risk. If such a\r\nservice was to be undertaken, it best became a warrior to expose himself\r\nin its execution, and he gave his refusal to let his betrothed proceed,\r\nmuch in the quiet but brief manner in which an Indian husband issues his\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\n"Well then, Delaware, go yourself if you\'re so tender of your squaw,"\r\nput in the unceremonious Hurry. "That moccasin must be had, or Floating\r\nTom will keep off, here, at arm\'s length, till the hearth cools in his\r\ncabin. It\'s but a little deerskin, a\'ter all, and cut this-a-way or\r\nthat-a-way, it\'s not a skear-crow to frighten true hunters from their\r\ngame. What say you, Sarpent, shall you or I canoe it?"\r\n\r\n"Let red man go.--Better eyes than pale-face--know Huron trick better,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"That I\'ll gainsay, to the hour of my death! A white man\'s eyes, and a\r\nwhite man\'s nose, and for that matter his sight and ears are all better\r\nthan an Injin\'s when fairly tried. Time and ag\'in have I put that to\r\nthe proof, and what is proved is sartain. Still I suppose the poorest\r\nvagabond going, whether Delaware or Huron, can find his way to yonder\r\nhut and back ag\'in, and so, Sarpent, use your paddle and welcome."\r\n\r\nChingachgook was already in the canoe, and he dipped the implement\r\nthe other named into the water, just as Hurry\'s limber tongue ceased.\r\nWah-ta-Wah saw the departure of her warrior on this occasion with the\r\nsubmissive silence of an Indian girl, but with most of the misgivings\r\nand apprehensions of her sex. Throughout the whole of the past night,\r\nand down to the moment, when they used the glass together in the\r\nhut, Chingachgook had manifested as much manly tenderness towards his\r\nbetrothed as one of the most refined sentiment could have shown under\r\nsimilar circumstances, but now every sign of weakness was lost in an\r\nappearance of stern resolution. Although Hist timidly endeavored to\r\ncatch his eye as the canoe left the side of the Ark, the pride of a\r\nwarrior would not permit him to meet her fond and anxious looks. The\r\ncanoe departed and not a wandering glance rewarded her solicitude.\r\n\r\nNor were the Delaware\'s care and gravity misplaced, under the\r\nimpressions with which he proceeded on this enterprise. If the enemy had\r\nreally gained possession of the building he was obliged to put himself\r\nunder the very muzzles of their rifles, as it were, and this too without\r\nthe protection of any of that cover which forms so essential an ally in\r\nIndian warfare. It is scarcely possible to conceive of a service more\r\ndangerous, and had the Serpent been fortified by the experience of ten\r\nmore years, or had his friend the Deerslayer been present, it would\r\nnever have been attempted; the advantages in no degree compensating for\r\nthe risk. But the pride of an Indian chief was acted on by the rivalry\r\nof colour, and it is not unlikely that the presence of the very creature\r\nfrom whom his ideas of manhood prevented his receiving a single glance,\r\noverflowing as he was with the love she so well merited, had no small\r\ninfluence on his determination.\r\n\r\nChingachgook paddled steadily towards the palisades, keeping his eyes on\r\nthe different loops of the building. Each instant he expected to see\r\nthe muzzle of a rifle protruded, or to hear its sharp crack; but he\r\nsucceeded in reaching the piles in safety. Here he was, in a measure,\r\nprotected, having the heads of the palisades between him and the hut,\r\nand the chances of any attempt on his life while thus covered, were\r\ngreatly diminished. The canoe had reached the piles with its head\r\ninclining northward, and at a short distance from the moccasin. Instead\r\nof turning to pick up the latter, the Delaware slowly made the circuit\r\nof the whole building, deliberately examining every object that should\r\nbetray the presence of enemies, or the commission of violence. Not a\r\nsingle sign could he discover, however, to confirm the suspicions that\r\nhad been awakened. The stillness of desertion pervaded the building; not\r\na fastening was displaced, not a window had been broken. The door looked\r\nas secure as at the hour when it was closed by Hutter, and even the gate\r\nof the dock had all the customary fastenings. In short, the most wary\r\nand jealous eye could detect no other evidence of the visit of enemies,\r\nthan that which was connected with the appearance of the floating\r\nmoccasin.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware was now greatly at a loss how to proceed. At one moment, as\r\nhe came round in front of the castle, he was on the point of stepping up\r\non the platform and of applying his eye to one of the loops, with a view\r\nof taking a direct personal inspection of the state of things within;\r\nbut he hesitated. Though of little experience in such matters, himself,\r\nhe had heard so much of Indian artifices through traditions, had\r\nlistened with such breathless interest to the narration of the escapes\r\nof the elder warriors, and, in short, was so well schooled in the theory\r\nof his calling, that it was almost as impossible for him to make\r\nany gross blunder on such an occasion, as it was for a well grounded\r\nscholar, who had commenced correctly, to fail in solving his problem in\r\nmathematics. Relinquishing the momentary intention to land, the chief\r\nslowly pursued his course round the palisades. As he approached the\r\nmoccasin, having now nearly completed the circuit of the building, he\r\nthrew the ominous article into the canoe, by a dexterous and almost\r\nimperceptible movement of his paddle. He was now ready to depart, but\r\nretreat was even more dangerous than the approach, as the eye could\r\nno longer be riveted on the loops. If there was really any one in the\r\ncastle, the motive of the Delaware in reconnoitering must be understood,\r\nand it was the wisest way, however perilous it might be, to retire\r\nwith an air of confidence, as if all distrust were terminated by the\r\nexamination. Such, accordingly, was the course adopted by the Indian,\r\nwho paddled deliberately away, taking the direction of the Ark,\r\nsuffering no nervous impulse to quicken the motions of his arms, or to\r\ninduce him to turn even a furtive glance behind him.\r\n\r\nNo tender wife, reared in the refinements of the highest civilization,\r\never met a husband on his return from the field with more of sensibility\r\nin her countenance than Hist discovered, as she saw the Great Serpent\r\nof the Delawares step, unharmed, into the Ark. Still she repressed her\r\nemotion, though the joy that sparkled in her dark eyes, and the smile\r\nthat lighted her pretty mouth, spoke a language that her betrothed could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n"Well, Sarpent," cried Hurry, always the first to speak, "what news\r\nfrom the muskrats? Did they shew their teeth, as you surrounded their\r\ndwelling?"\r\n\r\n"I no like him," sententiously returned the Delaware. "Too still. So\r\nstill, can see silence!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s downright Injin--as if any thing could make less noise than\r\nnothing! If you\'ve no better reason than this to give, old Tom had\r\nbetter hoist his sail, and go and get his breakfast under his own roof.\r\nWhat has become of the moccasin?"\r\n\r\n"Here," returned Chingachgook, holding up his prize for the general\r\ninspection. The moccasin was examined, and Hist confidently pronounced\r\nit to be Huron, by the manner in which the porcupine\'s quills were\r\narranged on its front. Hutter and the Delaware, too, were decidedly of\r\nthe same opinion. Admitting all this, however, it did not necessarily\r\nfollow that its owners were in the castle. The moccasin might have\r\ndrifted from a distance, or it might have fallen from the foot of some\r\nscout, who had quitted the place when his errand was accomplished. In\r\nshort it explained nothing, while it awakened so much distrust.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, Hutter and Hurry were not men to be long\r\ndeterred from proceeding by proofs as slight as that of the moccasin.\r\nThey hoisted the sail again, and the Ark was soon in motion, heading\r\ntowards the castle. The wind or air continued light, and the movement\r\nwas sufficiently slow to allow of a deliberate survey of the building,\r\nas the scow approached. The same death-like silence reigned, and it was\r\ndifficult to fancy that any thing possessing animal life could be in\r\nor around the place. Unlike the Serpent, whose imagination had acted\r\nthrough his traditions until he was ready to perceive an artificial,\r\nin a natural stillness, the others saw nothing to apprehend in a\r\ntranquility that, in truth, merely denoted the repose of inanimate\r\nobjects. The accessories of the scene, too, were soothing and calm,\r\nrather than exciting. The day had not yet advanced so far as to bring\r\nthe sun above the horizon, but the heavens, the atmosphere, and the\r\nwoods and lake were all seen under that softened light which immediately\r\nprecedes his appearance, and which perhaps is the most witching period\r\nof the four and twenty hours. It is the moment when every thing is\r\ndistinct, even the atmosphere seeming to possess a liquid lucidity, the\r\nhues appearing gray and softened, with the outlines of objects defined,\r\nand the perspective just as moral truths that are presented in their\r\nsimplicity, without the meretricious aids of ornament or glitter. In a\r\nword, it is the moment when the senses seem to recover their powers, in\r\nthe simplest and most accurate forms, like the mind emerging from the\r\nobscurity of doubts into the tranquility and peace of demonstration.\r\nMost of the influence that such a scene is apt to produce on those who\r\nare properly constituted in a moral sense, was lost on Hutter and\r\nHurry; but both the Delawares, though too much accustomed to witness\r\nthe loveliness of morning-tide to stop to analyze their feelings, were\r\nequally sensible of the beauties of the hour, though it was probably in\r\na way unknown to themselves. It disposed the young warrior to peace, and\r\nnever had he felt less longings for the glory of the combat, than when\r\nhe joined Hist in the cabin, the instant the scow rubbed against the\r\nside of the platform. From the indulgence of such gentle emotions,\r\nhowever, he was aroused by a rude summons from Hurry, who called on him\r\nto come forth and help to take in the sail, and to secure the Ark.\r\n\r\nChingachgook obeyed, and by the time he had reached the head of the\r\nscow, Hurry was on the platform, stamping his feet, like one glad to\r\ntouch what, by comparison, might be called terra firma, and proclaiming\r\nhis indifference to the whole Huron tribe in his customary noisy,\r\ndogmatical manner. Hutter had hauled a canoe up to the head of the scow,\r\nand was already about to undo the fastenings of the gate, in order to\r\nenter within the \'dock.\' March had no other motive in landing than a\r\nsenseless bravado, and having shaken the door in a manner to put its\r\nsolidity to the proof, he joined Hutter in the canoe and began to aid\r\nhim in opening the gate. The reader will remember that this mode of\r\nentrance was rendered necessary by the manner in which the owner of this\r\nsingular residence habitually secured it, whenever it was left empty;\r\nmore particularly at moments when danger was apprehended. Hutter had\r\nplaced a line in the Delaware\'s hand, on entering the canoe, intimating\r\nthat the other was to fasten the Ark to the platform and to lower the\r\nsail. Instead of following these directions, however, Chingachgook left\r\nthe sail standing, and throwing the bight of the rope over the head of\r\na pile, he permitted the Ark to drift round until it lay against the\r\ndefences, in a position where it could be entered only by means of a\r\nboat, or by passing along the summits of the palisades; the latter being\r\nan exploit that required some command of the feet, and which was not to\r\nbe attempted in the face of a resolute enemy.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this change in the position of the scow, which was\r\neffected before Hutter had succeeded in opening the gate of his dock,\r\nthe Ark and the Castle lay, as sailors would express it, yard-arm and\r\nyard-arm, kept asunder some ten or twelve feet by means of the piles. As\r\nthe scow pressed close against the latter, their tops formed a species\r\nof breast work that rose to the height of a man\'s head, covering in\r\na certain degree the parts of the scow that were not protected by the\r\ncabin. The Delaware surveyed this arrangement with great satisfaction\r\nand, as the canoe of Hutter passed through the gate into the dock, he\r\nthought that he might defend his position against any garrison in the\r\ncastle, for a sufficient time, could he but have had the helping arm of\r\nhis friend Deerslayer. As it was, he felt comparatively secure, and\r\nno longer suffered the keen apprehensions he had lately experienced in\r\nbehalf of Hist.\r\n\r\nA single shove sent the canoe from the gate to the trap beneath the\r\ncastle. Here Hutter found all fast, neither padlock nor chain nor bar\r\nhaving been molested. The key was produced, the locks removed, the chain\r\nloosened, and the trap pushed upward. Hurry now thrust his head in at\r\nthe opening; the arms followed, and the colossal legs rose without any\r\napparent effort. At the next instant, his heavy foot was heard stamping\r\nin the passage above; that which separated the chambers of the father\r\nand daughters, and into which the trap opened. He then gave a shout of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"Come on, old Tom," the reckless woodsman called out from within the\r\nbuilding--"here\'s your tenement, safe and sound; ay, and as empty as a\r\nnut that has passed half an hour in the paws of a squirrel! The Delaware\r\nbrags of being able to see silence; let him come here, and he may feel\r\nit, in the bargain."\r\n\r\n"Any silence where you are, Hurry Harry," returned Hutter, thrusting his\r\nhead in at the hole as he uttered the last word, which instantly caused\r\nhis voice to sound smothered to those without--"Any silence where you\r\nare, ought to be both seen and felt, for it\'s unlike any other silence."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, old fellow; hoist yourself up, and we\'ll open doors and\r\nwindows and let in the fresh air to brighten up matters. Few words in\r\ntroublesome times, make men the best fri\'nds. Your darter Judith is what\r\nI call a misbehaving young woman, and the hold of the whole family on me\r\nis so much weakened by her late conduct, that it wouldn\'t take a speech\r\nas long as the ten commandments to send me off to the river, leaving you\r\nand your traps, your Ark and your children, your man servants and your\r\nmaid servants, your oxen and your asses, to fight this battle with the\r\nIroquois by yourselves. Open that window, Floating Tom, and I\'ll blunder\r\nthrough and do the same job to the front door."\r\n\r\nA moment of silence succeeded, and a noise like that produced by the\r\nfall of a heavy body followed. A deep execration from Hurry succeeded,\r\nand then the whole interior of the building seemed alive. The noises\r\nthat now so suddenly, and we may add so unexpectedly even to the\r\nDelaware, broke the stillness within, could not be mistaken. They\r\nresembled those that would be produced by a struggle between tigers in a\r\ncage. Once or twice the Indian yell was given, but it seemed smothered,\r\nand as if it proceeded from exhausted or compressed throats, and, in a\r\nsingle instance, a deep and another shockingly revolting execration\r\ncame from the throat of Hurry. It appeared as if bodies were constantly\r\nthrown upon the floor with violence, as often rising to renew the\r\nstruggle. Chingachgook felt greatly at a loss what to do. He had all the\r\narms in the Ark, Hutter and Hurry having proceeded without their rifles,\r\nbut there was no means of using them, or of passing them to the hands of\r\ntheir owners. The combatants were literally caged, rendering it almost\r\nas impossible under the circumstances to get out, as to get into the\r\nbuilding. Then there was Hist to embarrass his movements, and to cripple\r\nhis efforts. With a view to relieve himself from this disadvantage,\r\nhe told the girl to take the remaining canoe and to join Hutter\'s\r\ndaughters, who were incautiously but deliberately approaching, in order\r\nto save herself, and to warn the others of their danger. But the girl\r\npositively and firmly refused to comply. At that moment no human power,\r\nshort of an exercise of superior physical force, could have induced her\r\nto quit the Ark. The exigency of the moment did not admit of delay, and\r\nthe Delaware seeing no possibility of serving his friends, cut the line\r\nand by a strong shove forced the scow some twenty feet clear of the\r\npiles. Here he took the sweeps and succeeded in getting a short distance\r\nto windward, if any direction could be thus termed in so light an air,\r\nbut neither the time, nor his skill at the oars, allowed the distance to\r\nbe great. When he ceased rowing, the Ark might have been a hundred yards\r\nfrom the platform, and half that distance to the southward of it, the\r\nsail being lowered. Judith and Hetty had now discovered that something\r\nwas wrong, and were stationary a thousand feet farther north.\r\n\r\nAll this while the furious struggle continued within the house. In\r\nscenes like these, events thicken in less time than they can be related.\r\nFrom the moment when the first fall was heard within the building to\r\nthat when the Delaware ceased his awkward attempts to row, it might have\r\nbeen three or four minutes, but it had evidently served to weaken the\r\ncombatants. The oaths and execrations of Hurry were no longer heard, and\r\neven the struggles had lost some of their force and fury. Nevertheless\r\nthey still continued with unabated perseverance. At this instant the\r\ndoor flew open, and the fight was transferred to the platform, the light\r\nand the open air. A Huron had undone the fastenings of the door, and\r\nthree or four of his tribe rushed after him upon the narrow space, as\r\nif glad to escape from some terrible scene within. The body of another\r\nfollowed, pitched headlong through the door with terrific violence. Then\r\nMarch appeared, raging like a lion at bay, and for an instant freed from\r\nhis numerous enemies. Hutter was already a captive and bound. There was\r\nnow a pause in the struggle, which resembled a lull in a tempest. The\r\nnecessity of breathing was common to all, and the combatants stood\r\nwatching each other, like mastiffs that have been driven from their\r\nholds, and are waiting for a favorable opportunity of renewing them. We\r\nshall profit by this pause to relate the manner in which the Indians had\r\nobtained possession of the castle, and this the more willingly because\r\nit may be necessary to explain to the reader why a conflict which\r\nhad been so close and fierce, should have also been so comparatively\r\nbloodless.\r\n\r\nRivenoak and his companion, particularly the latter who had appeared to\r\nbe a subordinate and occupied solely with his raft, had made the closest\r\nobservations in their visits to the castle. Even the boy had brought\r\naway minute and valuable information. By these means the Hurons obtained\r\na general idea of the manner in which the place was constructed and\r\nsecured, as well as of details that enabled them to act intelligently in\r\nthe dark. Notwithstanding the care that Hutter had taken to drop the Ark\r\non the east side of the building when he was in the act of transferring\r\nthe furniture from the former to the latter, he had been watched in a\r\nway to render the precaution useless. Scouts were on the look-out on\r\nthe eastern as well as on the western shore of the lake, and the whole\r\nproceeding had been noted. As soon as it was dark, rafts like that\r\nalready described approached from both shores to reconnoitre, and\r\nthe Ark had passed within fifty feet of one of them without its being\r\ndiscovered; the men it held lying at their length on the logs, so as\r\nto blend themselves and their slow moving machine with the water. When\r\nthese two sets of adventurers drew near the castle they encountered\r\neach other, and after communicating their respective observations, they\r\nunhesitatingly approached the building. As had been expected, it was\r\nfound empty. The rafts were immediately sent for a reinforcement to the\r\nshore, and two of the savages remained to profit by their situation.\r\nThese men succeeded in getting on the roof, and by removing some of the\r\nbark, in entering what might be termed the garret. Here they were found\r\nby their companions. Hatchets now opened a hole through the squared\r\nlogs of the upper floor, through which no less than eight of the most\r\nathletic of the Indians dropped into the rooms beneath. Here they were\r\nleft, well supplied with arms and provisions, either to stand a siege,\r\nor to make a sortie, as the case might require. The night was passed in\r\nsleep, as is usual with Indians in a state of inactivity. The returning\r\nday brought them a view of the approach of the Ark through the loops,\r\nthe only manner in which light and air were now admitted, the windows\r\nbeing closed most effectually with plank, rudely fashioned to fit. As\r\nsoon as it was ascertained that the two white men were about to enter by\r\nthe trap, the chief who directed the proceedings of the Hurons took his\r\nmeasures accordingly. He removed all the arms from his own people, even\r\nto the knives, in distrust of savage ferocity when awakened by personal\r\ninjuries, and he hid them where they could not be found without a\r\nsearch. Ropes of bark were then prepared, and taking their stations in\r\nthe three different rooms, they all waited for the signal to fall upon\r\ntheir intended captives. As soon as the party had entered the building,\r\nmen without replaced the bark of the roof, removed every sign of their\r\nvisit, with care, and then departed for the shore. It was one of these\r\nwho had dropped his moccasin, which he had not been able to find again\r\nin the dark. Had the death of the girl been known, it is probable\r\nnothing could have saved the lives of Hurry and Hutter, but that event\r\noccurred after the ambush was laid, and at a distance of several miles\r\nfrom the encampment near the castle. Such were the means that had been\r\nemployed to produce the state of things we shall continue to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Now all is done that man can do,\r\n    And all is done in vain!\r\n    My love!  my native land, adieu\r\n    For I must cross the main, My dear,\r\n    For I must cross the main."\r\n\r\n    Robert Burns, "It was a\' for our Rightfu\' King," II.  7-12.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter we left the combatants breathing in their narrow lists.\r\nAccustomed to the rude sports of wrestling and jumping, then so common\r\nin America, more especially on the frontiers, Hurry possessed an\r\nadvantage, in addition to his prodigious strength, that had rendered the\r\nstruggle less unequal than it might otherwise appear to be. This alone\r\nhad enabled him to hold out so long, against so many enemies, for the\r\nIndian is by no means remarkable for his skill, or force, in athletic\r\nexercises. As yet, no one had been seriously hurt, though several of the\r\nsavages had received severe falls, and he, in particular, who had been\r\nthrown bodily upon the platform, might be said to be temporarily hors\r\nde combat. Some of the rest were limping, and March himself had not\r\nentirely escaped from bruises, though want of breath was the principal\r\nloss that both sides wished to repair.\r\n\r\nUnder circumstances like those in which the parties were placed, a\r\ntruce, let it come from what cause it might, could not well be of long\r\ncontinuance. The arena was too confined, and the distrust of treachery\r\ntoo great, to admit of this. Contrary to what might be expected in his\r\nsituation, Hurry was the first to recommence hostilities. Whether this\r\nproceeded from policy, an idea that he might gain some advantage by\r\nmaking a sudden and unexpected assault, or was the fruit of irritation\r\nand his undying hatred of an Indian, it is impossible to say. His onset\r\nwas furious, however, and at first it carried all before it. He seized\r\nthe nearest Huron by the waist, raised him entirely from the platform,\r\nand hurled him into the water, as if he had been a child. In half a\r\nminute, two more were at his side, one of whom received a grave injury\r\nby the friend who had just preceded him. But four enemies remained, and,\r\nin a hand to hand conflict, in which no arms were used but those which\r\nnature had furnished, Hurry believed himself fully able to cope with\r\nthat number of red-skins.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! Old Tom," he shouted--"The rascals are taking to the lake, and\r\nI\'ll soon have \'em all swimming!" As these words were uttered a violent\r\nkick in the face sent back the injured Indian, who had caught at the\r\nedge of the platform, and was endeavoring to raise himself to its level,\r\nhelplessly and hopelessly into the water. When the affray was over,\r\nhis dark body was seen, through the limpid element of the Glimmerglass,\r\nlying, with outstretched arms, extended on the bottom of the shoal on\r\nwhich the Castle stood, clinging to the sands and weeds, as if life were\r\nto be retained by this frenzied grasp of death. A blow sent into the pit\r\nof another\'s stomach doubled him up like a worm that had been trodden\r\non, and but two able bodied foes remained to be dealt with. One of\r\nthese, however, was not only the largest and strongest of the Hurons,\r\nbut he was also the most experienced of their warriors present, and that\r\none whose sinews were the best strung in fights, and by marches on\r\nthe warpath. This man fully appreciated the gigantic strength of his\r\nopponent, and had carefully husbanded his own. He was also equipped\r\nin the best manner for such a conflict, standing in nothing but his\r\nbreech-cloth, the model of a naked and beautiful statue of agility and\r\nstrength. To grasp him required additional dexterity and unusual force.\r\nStill Hurry did not hesitate, but the kick that had actually destroyed\r\none fellow creature was no sooner given, than he closed in with this\r\nformidable antagonist, endeavoring to force him into the water, also.\r\nThe struggle that succeeded was truly frightful. So fierce did it\r\nimmediately become, and so quick and changeful were the evolutions of\r\nthe athletes, that the remaining savage had no chance for interfering,\r\nhad he possessed the desire; but wonder and apprehension held him\r\nspell bound. He was an inexperienced youth, and his blood curdled as\r\nhe witnessed the fell strife of human passions, exhibited too, in an\r\nunaccustomed form.\r\n\r\nHurry first attempted to throw his antagonist. With this view he seized\r\nhim by the throat, and an arm, and tripped with the quickness and\r\nforce of an American borderer. The effect was frustrated by the agile\r\nmovements of the Huron, who had clothes to grasp by, and whose feet\r\navoided the attempt with a nimbleness equal to that with which it was\r\nmade. Then followed a sort of melee, if such a term can be applied to\r\na struggle between two in which no efforts were strictly visible,\r\nthe limbs and bodies of the combatants assuming so many attitudes and\r\ncontortions as to defeat observation. This confused but fierce rally\r\nlasted less than a minute, however; when, Hurry, furious at having\r\nhis strength baffled by the agility and nakedness of his foe, made\r\na desperate effort, which sent the Huron from him, hurling his body\r\nviolently against the logs of the hut. The concussion was so great as\r\nmomentarily to confuse the latter\'s faculties. The pain, too, extorted\r\na deep groan; an unusual concession to agony to escape a red man in\r\nthe heat of battle. Still he rushed forward again to meet his enemy,\r\nconscious that his safety rested on it\'s resolution. Hurry now seized\r\nthe other by the waist, raised him bodily from the platform, and fell\r\nwith his own great weight on the form beneath. This additional shock\r\nso stunned the sufferer, that his gigantic white opponent now had him\r\ncompletely at his mercy. Passing his hands around the throat of his\r\nvictim, he compressed them with the strength of a vice, fairly doubling\r\nthe head of the Huron over the edge of the platform, until the chin was\r\nuppermost, with the infernal strength he expended. An instant sufficed\r\nto show the consequences. The eyes of the sufferer seemed to start\r\nforward, his tongue protruded, and his nostrils dilated nearly to\r\nsplitting. At this instant a rope of bark, having an eye, was passed\r\ndexterously within the two arms of Hurry, the end threaded the eye,\r\nforming a noose, and his elbows were drawn together behind his\r\nback, with a power that all his gigantic strength could not resist.\r\nReluctantly, even under such circumstances, did the exasperated borderer\r\nsee his hands drawn from their deadly grasp, for all the evil passions\r\nwere then in the ascendant. Almost at the same instant a similar\r\nfastening secured his ankles, and his body was rolled to the centre of\r\nthe platform as helplessly, and as cavalierly, as if it were a log of\r\nwood. His rescued antagonist, however, did not rise, for while he began\r\nagain to breathe, his head still hung helplessly over the edge of the\r\nlogs, and it was thought at first that his neck was dislocated. He\r\nrecovered gradually only, and it was hours before he could walk. Some\r\nfancied that neither his body, nor his mind, ever totally recovered from\r\nthis near approach to death.\r\n\r\nHurry owed his defeat and capture to the intensity with which he had\r\nconcentrated all his powers on his fallen foe. While thus occupied, the\r\ntwo Indians he had hurled into the water mounted to the heads of the\r\npiles, along which they passed, and joined their companion on the\r\nplatform. The latter had so far rallied his faculties as to have gotten\r\nthe ropes, which were in readiness for use as the others appeared, and\r\nthey were applied in the manner related, as Hurry lay pressing his\r\nenemy down with his whole weight, intent only on the horrible office of\r\nstrangling him. Thus were the tables turned, in a single moment; he who\r\nhad been so near achieving a victory that would have been renowned\r\nfor ages, by means of traditions, throughout all that region, lying\r\nhelpless, bound and a captive. So fearful had been the efforts of the\r\npale-face, and so prodigious the strength he exhibited, that even as he\r\nlay tethered like a sheep before them, they regarded him with respect,\r\nand not without dread. The helpless body of their stoutest warrior was\r\nstill stretched on the platform, and, as they cast their eyes towards\r\nthe lake, in quest of the comrade that had been hurled into it so\r\nunceremoniously, and of whom they had lost sight in the confusion of\r\nthe fray, they perceived his lifeless form clinging to the grass on the\r\nbottom, as already described. These several circumstances contributed to\r\nrender the victory of the Hurons almost as astounding to themselves as a\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nChingachgook and his betrothed witnessed the whole of this struggle from\r\nthe Ark. When the three Hurons were about to pass the cords around the\r\narms of the prostrate Hurry the Delaware sought his rifle, but, before\r\nhe could use it the white man was bound and the mischief was done. He\r\nmight still bring down an enemy, but to obtain the scalp was impossible,\r\nand the young chief, who would so freely risk his own life to obtain\r\nsuch a trophy, hesitated about taking that of a foe without such an\r\nobject in view. A glance at Hist, and the recollection of what might\r\nfollow, checked any transient wish for revenge. The reader has been told\r\nthat Chingachgook could scarcely be said to know how to manage the oars\r\nof the Ark at all, however expert he might be in the use of the paddle.\r\nPerhaps there is no manual labor at which men are so bungling and\r\nawkward, as in their first attempts to pull oar, even the experienced\r\nmariner, or boat man, breaking down in his efforts to figure with the\r\ncelebrated rullock of the gondolier. In short it is, temporarily, an\r\nimpracticable thing for a new beginner to succeed with a single oar, but\r\nin this case it was necessary to handle two at the same time, and those\r\nof great size. Sweeps, or large oars, however, are sooner rendered of\r\nuse by the raw hand than lighter implements, and this was the reason\r\nthat the Delaware had succeeded in moving the Ark as well as he did in a\r\nfirst trial. That trial, notwithstanding, sufficed to produce distrust,\r\nand he was fully aware of the critical situation in which Hist and\r\nhimself were now placed, should the Hurons take to the canoe that was\r\nstill lying beneath the trap, and come against them. At the moment he\r\nthought of putting Hist into the canoe in his own possession, and of\r\ntaking to the eastern mountain in the hope of reaching the Delaware\r\nvillages by direct flight. But many considerations suggested themselves\r\nto put a stop to this indiscreet step. It was almost certain that scouts\r\nwatched the lake on both sides, and no canoe could possibly approach\r\nshore without being seen from the hills. Then a trail could not be\r\nconcealed from Indian eyes, and the strength of Hist was unequal to\r\na flight sufficiently sustained to outstrip the pursuit of trained\r\nwarriors. This was a part of America in which the Indians did not know\r\nthe use of horses, and everything would depend on the physical energies\r\nof the fugitives. Last, but far from being least, were the thoughts\r\nconnected with the situation of Deerslayer, a friend who was not to be\r\ndeserted in his extremity.\r\n\r\nHist in some particulars reasoned, and even felt, differently though she\r\narrived at the same conclusions. Her own anger disturbed her less than\r\nher concern for the two sisters, on whose behalf her womanly sympathies\r\nwere now strongly enlisted. The canoe of the girls, by the time the\r\nstruggle on the platform had ceased, was within three hundred yards of\r\nthe castle, and here Judith ceased paddling, the evidences of strife\r\nfirst becoming apparent to the eyes. She and Hetty were standing erect,\r\nanxiously endeavoring to ascertain what had occurred, but unable to\r\nsatisfy their doubts from the circumstance that the building, in a great\r\nmeasure, concealed the scene of action.\r\n\r\nThe parties in the Ark, and in the canoe, were indebted to the ferocity\r\nof Hurry\'s attack for their momentary security. In any ordinary case,\r\nthe girls would have been immediately captured, a measure easy of\r\nexecution now the savages had a canoe, were it not for the rude check\r\nthe audacity of the Hurons had received in the recent struggle. It\r\nrequired some little time to recover from the effects of this violent\r\nscene, and this so much the more, because the principal man of the\r\nparty, in the way of personal prowess at least, had been so great a\r\nsufferer. Still it was of the last importance that Judith and her sister\r\nshould seek immediate refuge in the Ark, where the defences offered a\r\ntemporary shelter at least, and the first step was to devise the means\r\nof inducing them to do so. Hist showed herself in the stern of the scow,\r\nand made many gestures and signs, in vain, in order to induce the girls\r\nto make a circuit to avoid the Castle, and to approach the Ark from\r\nthe eastward. But these signs were distrusted or misunderstood. It is\r\nprobable Judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of\r\nthings to put full confidence in either party. Instead of doing as\r\ndesired, she rather kept more aloof, paddling slowly back to the north,\r\nor into the broadest part of the lake, where she could command the\r\nwidest view, and had the fairest field for flight before her. At\r\nthis instant the sun appeared above the pines of the eastern range of\r\nmountains and a light southerly breeze arose, as was usual enough at\r\nthat season and hour. Chingachgook lost no time in hoisting the sail.\r\nWhatever might be in reserve for him, there could be no question that\r\nit was every way desirable to get the Ark at such a distance from the\r\ncastle as to reduce his enemies to the necessity of approaching the\r\nformer in the canoe, which the chances of war had so inopportunely, for\r\nhis wishes and security, thrown into their hands. The appearance of the\r\nopening duck seemed first to arouse the Hurons from their apathy, and by\r\nthe time the head of the scow had fallen off before the wind, which it\r\ndid unfortunately in the wrong direction, bringing it within a few\r\nyards of the platform, Hist found it necessary to warn her lover of the\r\nimportance of covering his person against the rifles of his foes. This\r\nwas a danger to be avoided under all circumstances, and so much the\r\nmore, because the Delaware found that Hist would not take to the cover\r\nherself so long as he remained exposed. Accordingly, Chingachgook\r\nabandoned the scow to its own movements, forced Hist into the cabin, the\r\ndoors of which he immediately secured, and then he looked about him for\r\nthe rifles. The situation of the parties was now so singular as to merit\r\na particular description. The Ark was within sixty yards of the castle,\r\na little to the southward, or to windward of it, with its sail full, and\r\nthe steering oar abandoned. The latter, fortunately, was loose, so\r\nthat it produced no great influence on the crab like movements of the\r\nunwieldy craft. The sail being as sailors term it, flying, or having no\r\nbraces, the air forced the yard forward, though both sheets were fast.\r\nThe effect was threefold on a boat with a bottom that was perfectly\r\nflat, and which drew merely some three or four inches water. It pressed\r\nthe head slowly round to leeward, it forced the whole fabric bodily\r\nin the same direction at the same time, and the water that unavoidably\r\ngathered under the lee gave the scow also a forward movement. All these\r\nchanges were exceedingly slow, however, for the wind was not only light,\r\nbut it was baffling as usual, and twice or thrice the sail shook. Once\r\nit was absolutely taken aback.\r\n\r\nHad there been any keel to the Ark, it would inevitably have run foul of\r\nthe platform, bows on, when it is probable nothing could have prevented\r\nthe Hurons from carrying it; more particularly as the sail would have\r\nenabled them to approach under cover. As it was, the scow wore slowly\r\nround, barely clearing that part of the building. The piles projecting\r\nseveral feet, they were not cleared, but the head of the slow moving\r\ncraft caught between two of them, by one of its square corners, and\r\nhung. At this moment the Delaware was vigilantly watching through a loop\r\nfor an opportunity to fire, while the Hurons kept within the building,\r\nsimilarly occupied. The exhausted warrior reclined against the hut,\r\nthere having been no time to remove him, and Hurry lay, almost as\r\nhelpless as a log, tethered like a sheep on its way to the slaughter,\r\nnear the middle of the platform. Chingachgook could have slain the\r\nfirst, at any moment, but his scalp would have been safe, and the young\r\nchief disdained to strike a blow that could lead to neither honor nor\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n"Run out one of the poles, Sarpent, if Sarpent you be," said Hurry, amid\r\nthe groans that the tightness of the ligatures was beginning to extort\r\nfrom him--"run out one of the poles, and shove the head of the scow off,\r\nand you\'ll drift clear of us--and, when you\'ve done that good turn for\r\nyourself just finish this gagging blackguard for me."\r\n\r\nThe appeal of Hurry, however, had no other effect than to draw\r\nthe attention of Hist to his situation. This quick witted creature\r\ncomprehended it at a glance. His ankles were bound with several turns of\r\nstout bark rope, and his arms, above the elbows, were similarly secured\r\nbehind his back; barely leaving him a little play of the hands and\r\nwrists. Putting her mouth near a loop she said in a low but distinct\r\nvoice--"Why you don\'t roll here, and fall in scow? Chingachgook shoot\r\nHuron, if he chase!"\r\n\r\n"By the Lord, gal, that\'s a judgematical thought, and it shall be tried,\r\nif the starn of your scow will come a little nearer. Put a bed at the\r\nbottom, for me to fall on."\r\n\r\nThis was said at a happy moment, for, tired of waiting, all the Indians\r\nmade a rapid discharge of their rifles, almost simultaneously, injuring\r\nno one; though several bullets passed through the loops. Hist had heard\r\npart of Hurry\'s words, but most of what he said was lost in the sharp\r\nreports of the firearms. She undid the bar of the door that led to the\r\nstern of the scow, but did not dare to expose her person. All this time,\r\nthe head of the Ark hung, but by a gradually decreasing hold as the\r\nother end swung slowly round, nearer and nearer to the platform. Hurry,\r\nwho now lay with his face towards the Ark, occasionally writhing and\r\nturning over like one in pain, evolutions he had performed ever since he\r\nwas secured, watched every change, and, at last, he saw that the whole\r\nvessel was free, and was beginning to grate slowly along the sides\r\nof the piles. The attempt was desperate, but it seemed to be the only\r\nchance for escaping torture and death, and it suited the reckless daring\r\nof the man\'s character. Waiting to the last moment, in order that the\r\nstern of the scow might fairly rub against the platform, he began to\r\nwrithe again, as if in intolerable suffering, execrating all Indians in\r\ngeneral, and the Hurons in particular, and then he suddenly and rapidly\r\nrolled over and over, taking the direction of the stern of the scow.\r\nUnfortunately, Hurry\'s shoulders required more space to revolve in\r\nthan his feet, and by the time he reached the edge of the platform\r\nhis direction had so far changed as to carry him clear of the Ark\r\naltogether, and the rapidity of his revolutions and the emergency\r\nadmitting of no delay, he fell into the water. At this instant,\r\nChingachgook, by an understanding with his betrothed, drew the fire of\r\nthe Hurons again, not a man of whom saw the manner in which one whom\r\nthey knew to be effectually tethered, had disappeared. But Hist\'s\r\nfeelings were strongly interested in the success of so bold a scheme,\r\nand she watched the movements of Hurry as the cat watches the mouse. The\r\nmoment he was in motion she foresaw the consequences, and this the more\r\nreadily, as the scow was now beginning to move with some steadiness, and\r\nshe bethought her of the means of saving him. With a sort of instinctive\r\nreadiness, she opened the door at the very moment the rifles were\r\nringing in her ears, and protected by the intervening cabin, she stepped\r\ninto the stem of the scow in time to witness the fall of Hurry into the\r\nlake. Her foot was unconsciously placed on the end of one of the sheets\r\nof the sail, which was fastened aft, and catching up all the spare rope\r\nwith the awkwardness, but also with the generous resolution of a woman,\r\nshe threw it in the direction of the helpless Hurry. The line fell\r\non the head and body of the sinking man and he not only succeeded in\r\ngrasping separate parts of it with his hands, but he actually got\r\na portion of it between his teeth. Hurry was an expert swimmer, and\r\ntethered as he was he resorted to the very expedient that philosophy and\r\nreflection would have suggested. He had fallen on his back, and instead\r\nof floundering and drowning himself by desperate efforts to walk on the\r\nwater, he permitted his body to sink as low as possible, and was already\r\nsubmerged, with the exception of his face, when the line reached him.\r\nIn this situation he might possibly have remained until rescued by the\r\nHurons, using his hands as fishes use their fins, had he received no\r\nother succour, but the movement of the Ark soon tightened the rope, and\r\nof course he was dragged gently ahead holding even pace with the scow.\r\nThe motion aided in keeping his face above the surface of the water, and\r\nit would have been possible for one accustomed to endurance to have been\r\ntowed a mile in this singular but simple manner.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Hurons did not observe the sudden\r\ndisappearance of Hurry. In his present situation he was not only hid\r\nfrom view by the platform, but, as the Ark drew slowly ahead, impelled\r\nby a sail that was now filled, he received the same friendly service\r\nfrom the piles. The Hurons, indeed, were too intent on endeavoring to\r\nslay their Delaware foe, by sending a bullet through some one of the\r\nloops or crevices of the cabin, to bethink them at all of one whom they\r\nfancied so thoroughly tied. Their great concern was the manner in which\r\nthe Ark rubbed past the piles, although its motion was lessened at least\r\none half by the friction, and they passed into the northern end of the\r\ncastle in order to catch opportunities of firing through the loops of\r\nthat part of the building. Chingachgook was similarly occupied, and\r\nremained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation of Hurry. As the\r\nArk grated along the rifles sent their little clouds of smoke from one\r\ncover to the other, but the eyes and movements of the opposing parties\r\nwere too quick to permit any injury to be done. At length one side had\r\nthe mortification and the other the pleasure of seeing the scow swing\r\nclear of the piles altogether, when it immediately moved away, with a\r\nmaterially accelerated motion, towards the north.\r\n\r\nChingachgook now first learned from Hist the critical condition of\r\nHurry. To have exposed either of their persons in the stern of the scow\r\nwould have been certain death, but fortunately the sheet to which the\r\nman clung led forward to the foot of the sail. The Delaware found means\r\nto unloosen it from the cleet aft, and Hist, who was already forward for\r\nthat purpose, immediately began to pull upon the line. At this moment\r\nHurry was towing fifty or sixty feet astern, with nothing but his face\r\nabove water. As he was dragged out clear of the castle and the piles\r\nhe was first perceived by the Hurons, who raised a hideous yell and\r\ncommenced a fire on, what may very well be termed the floating mass. It\r\nwas at the same instant that Hist began to pull upon the line forward--a\r\ncircumstance that probably saved Hurry\'s life, aided by his own\r\nself-possession and border readiness. The first bullet struck the\r\nwater directly on the spot where the broad chest of the young giant was\r\nvisible through the pure element, and might have pierced his heart had\r\nthe angle at which it was fired been less acute. Instead of penetrating\r\nthe lake, however, it glanced from its smooth surface, rose, and buried\r\nitself in the logs of the cabin near the spot at which Chingachgook had\r\nshown himself the minute before, while clearing the line from the cleet.\r\nA second, and a third, and a fourth bullet followed, all meeting\r\nwith the same resistance of the water, though Hurry sensibly felt the\r\nviolence of the blows they struck upon the lake so immediately above,\r\nand so near his breast. Discovering their mistake, the Hurons now\r\nchanged their plan, and aimed at the uncovered face; but by this\r\ntime Hist was pulling on the line, the target advanced and the deadly\r\nmissiles still fell upon the water. In another moment the body was\r\ndragged past the end of the scow and became concealed. As for the\r\nDelaware and Hist, they worked perfectly covered by the cabin, and in\r\nless time than it requires to tell it, they had hauled the huge frame of\r\nHarry to the place they occupied. Chingachgook stood in readiness with\r\nhis keen knife, and bending over the side of the scow he soon severed\r\nthe bark that bound the limbs of the borderer. To raise him high enough\r\nto reach the edge of the boat and to aid him in entering were less easy,\r\nas Hurry\'s arms were still nearly useless, but both were done in time,\r\nwhen the liberated man staggered forward and fell exhausted and helpless\r\ninto the bottom of the scow. Here we shall leave him to recover his\r\nstrength and the due circulation of his blood, while we proceed with\r\nthe narrative of events that crowd upon us too fast to admit of any\r\npostponement. The moment the Hurons lost sight of the body of Hurry they\r\ngave a common yell of disappointment, and three of the most active of\r\ntheir number ran to the trap and entered the canoe. It required some\r\nlittle delay, however, to embark with their weapons, to find the paddles\r\nand, if we may use a phrase so purely technical, "to get out of dock."\r\nBy this time Hurry was in the scow, and the Delaware had his rifles\r\nagain in readiness. As the Ark necessarily sailed before the wind, it\r\nhad got by this time quite two hundred yards from the castle, and was\r\nsliding away each instant, farther and farther, though with a motion so\r\neasy as scarcely to stir the water. The canoe of the girls was quite\r\na quarter of a mile distant from the Ark, obviously keeping aloof, in\r\nignorance of what had occurred, and in apprehension of the consequences\r\nof venturing too near. They had taken the direction of the eastern\r\nshore, endeavoring at the same time to get to windward of the Ark, and\r\nin a manner between the two parties, as if distrusting which was to be\r\nconsidered a friend, and which an enemy. The girls, from long habit,\r\nused the paddles with great dexterity, and Judith, in particular, had\r\noften sportively gained races, in trials of speed with the youths that\r\noccasionally visited the lake.\r\n\r\nWhen the three Hurons emerged from behind the palisades, and found\r\nthemselves on the open lake, and under the necessity of advancing\r\nunprotected on the Ark, if they persevered in the original design, their\r\nardor sensibly cooled. In a bark canoe they were totally without cover,\r\nand Indian discretion was entirely opposed to such a sacrifice of life\r\nas would most probably follow any attempt to assault an enemy entrenched\r\nas effectually as the Delaware. Instead of following the Ark, therefore,\r\nthese three warriors inclined towards the eastern shore, keeping at\r\na safe distance from the rifles of Chingachgook. But this manoeuvre\r\nrendered the position of the girls exceedingly critical. It threatened\r\nto place them if not between two fires, at least between two dangers, or\r\nwhat they conceived to be dangers, and instead of permitting the Hurons\r\nto enclose her, in what she fancied a sort of net, Judith immediately\r\ncommenced her retreat in a southern direction, at no very great distance\r\nfrom the shore. She did not dare to land; if such an expedient were\r\nto be resorted to at all, she could only venture on it in the last\r\nextremity. At first the Indians paid little or no attention to the other\r\ncanoe, for, fully apprised of its contents, they deemed its capture\r\nof comparatively little moment, while the Ark, with its imaginary\r\ntreasures, the persons of the Delaware and of Hurry, and its means of\r\nmovement on a large scale, was before them. But this Ark had its\r\ndangers as well as its temptations, and after wasting near an hour in\r\nvacillating evolutions, always at a safe distance from the rifle, the\r\nHurons seemed suddenly to take their resolution, and began to display it\r\nby giving eager chase to the girls.\r\n\r\nWhen this last design was adopted, the circumstances of all parties, as\r\nconnected with their relative positions, were materially changed.\r\nThe Ark had sailed and drifted quite half a mile, and was nearly that\r\ndistance due north of the castle. As soon as the Delaware perceived that\r\nthe girls avoided him, unable to manage his unwieldy craft, and knowing\r\nthat flight from a bark canoe, in the event of pursuit, would be a\r\nuseless expedient if attempted, he had lowered his sail, in the hope it\r\nmight induce the sisters to change their plan and to seek refuge in the\r\nscow. This demonstration produced no other effect than to keep the Ark\r\nnearer to the scene of action, and to enable those in her to become\r\nwitnesses of the chase. The canoe of Judith was about a quarter of a\r\nmile south of that of the Hurons, a little nearer to the east shore, and\r\nabout the same distance to the southward of the castle as it was from\r\nthe hostile canoe, a circumstance which necessarily put the last nearly\r\nabreast of Hutter\'s fortress. With the several parties thus situated the\r\nchase commenced.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the Hurons so suddenly changed their mode of attack\r\ntheir canoe was not in the best possible racing trim. There were but\r\ntwo paddles, and the third man so much extra and useless cargo. Then\r\nthe difference in weight between the sisters and the other two men,\r\nmore especially in vessels so extremely light, almost neutralized any\r\ndifference that might proceed from the greater strength of the Hurons,\r\nand rendered the trial of speed far from being as unequal as it might\r\nseem. Judith did not commence her exertions until the near approach of\r\nthe other canoe rendered the object of the movement certain, and then\r\nshe exhorted Hetty to aid her with her utmost skill and strength.\r\n\r\n"Why should we run, Judith?" asked the simple minded girl. "The Hurons\r\nhave never harmed me, nor do I think they ever will."\r\n\r\n"That may be true as to you, Hetty, but it will prove very different\r\nwith me. Kneel down and say your prayer, and then rise and do your\r\nutmost to help escape. Think of me, dear girl, too, as you pray."\r\n\r\nJudith gave these directions from a mixed feeling; first because she\r\nknew that her sister ever sought the support of her great ally in\r\ntrouble, and next because a sensation of feebleness and dependance\r\nsuddenly came over her own proud spirit, in that moment of apparent\r\ndesertion and trial. The prayer was quickly said, however, and the\r\ncanoe was soon in rapid motion. Still, neither party resorted to their\r\ngreatest exertions from the outset, both knowing that the chase\r\nwas likely to be arduous and long. Like two vessels of war that are\r\npreparing for an encounter, they seemed desirous of first ascertaining\r\ntheir respective rates of speed, in order that they might know how to\r\ngraduate their exertions, previously to the great effort. A few minutes\r\nsufficed to show the Hurons that the girls were expert, and that it\r\nwould require all their skill and energies to overtake them.\r\n\r\nJudith had inclined towards the eastern shore at the commencement of the\r\nchase, with a vague determination of landing and flying to the woods as\r\na last resort, but as she approached the land, the certainty that scouts\r\nmust be watching her movements made her reluctance to adopt such an\r\nexpedient unconquerable. Then she was still fresh, and had sanguine\r\nhopes of being able to tire out her pursuers. With such feelings she\r\ngave a sweep with her paddle, and sheered off from the fringe of dark\r\nhemlocks beneath the shades of which she was so near entering, and held\r\nher way again, more towards the centre of the lake. This seemed the\r\ninstant favorable for the Hurons to make their push, as it gave them\r\nthe entire breadth of the sheet to do it in; and this too in the widest\r\npart, as soon as they had got between the fugitives and the land. The\r\ncanoes now flew, Judith making up for what she wanted in strength by her\r\ngreat dexterity and self command. For half a mile the Indians gained\r\nno material advantage, but the continuance of so great exertions for so\r\nmany minutes sensibly affected all concerned. Here the Indians resorted\r\nto an expedient that enabled them to give one of their party time to\r\nbreathe, by shifting their paddles from hand to hand, and this too\r\nwithout sensibly relaxing their efforts.\r\n\r\nJudith occasionally looked behind her, and she saw this expedient\r\npractised. It caused her immediately to distrust the result, since her\r\npowers of endurance were not likely to hold out against those of men who\r\nhad the means of relieving each other. Still she persevered, allowing no\r\nvery visible consequences immediately to follow the change.\r\n\r\nAs yet the Indians had not been able to get nearer to the girls than two\r\nhundred yards, though they were what seamen would term "in their wake";\r\nor in a direct line behind them, passing over the same track of water.\r\nThis made the pursuit what is technically called a "stern chase",\r\nwhich is proverbially a "long chase": the meaning of which is that, in\r\nconsequence of the relative positions of the parties, no change becomes\r\napparent except that which is a direct gain in the nearest possible\r\napproach. "Long" as this species of chase is admitted to be, however,\r\nJudith was enabled to perceive that the Hurons were sensibly drawing\r\nnearer and nearer, before she had gained the centre of the lake. She\r\nwas not a girl to despair, but there was an instant when she thought of\r\nyielding, with the wish of being carried to the camp where she knew the\r\nDeerslayer to be a captive; but the considerations connected with the\r\nmeans she hoped to be able to employ in order to procure his release\r\nimmediately interposed, in order to stimulate her to renewed exertions.\r\nHad there been any one there to note the progress of the two canoes, he\r\nwould have seen that of Judith flying swiftly away from its pursuers,\r\nas the girl gave it freshly impelled speed, while her mind was thus\r\ndwelling on her own ardent and generous schemes. So material, indeed,\r\nwas the difference in the rate of going between the two canoes for\r\nthe next five minutes, that the Hurons began to be convinced all their\r\npowers must be exerted or they would suffer the disgrace of being\r\nbaffled by women. Making a furious effort under the mortification of\r\nsuch a conviction, one of the strongest of their party broke his paddle\r\nat the very moment when he had taken it from the hand of a comrade to\r\nrelieve him. This at once decided the matter, a canoe containing three\r\nmen and having but one paddle being utterly unable to overtake fugitives\r\nlike the daughters of Thomas Hutter.\r\n\r\n"There, Judith!" exclaimed Hetty, who saw the accident, "I hope now you\r\nwill own, that praying is useful! The Hurons have broke a paddle, and\r\nthey never can overtake us."\r\n\r\n"I never denied it, poor Hetty, and sometimes wish in bitterness of\r\nspirit that I had prayed more myself, and thought less of my beauty!\r\nAs you say, we are now safe and need only go a little south and take\r\nbreath."\r\n\r\nThis was done; the enemy giving up the pursuit, as suddenly as a ship\r\nthat has lost an important spar, the instant the accident occurred.\r\nInstead of following Judith\'s canoe, which was now lightly skimming over\r\nthe water towards the south, the Hurons turned their bows towards the\r\ncastle, where they soon arrived and landed. The girls, fearful that some\r\nspare paddles might be found in or about the buildings, continued on,\r\nnor did they stop until so distant from their enemies as to give them\r\nevery chance of escape, should the chase be renewed. It would seem that\r\nthe savages meditated no such design, but at the end of an hour their\r\ncanoe, filled with men, was seen quitting the castle and steering\r\ntowards the shore. The girls were without food, and they now drew nearer\r\nto the buildings and the Ark, having finally made up their minds from\r\nits manoeuvres that the latter contained friends.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the seeming desertion of the castle, Judith approached\r\nit with extreme caution. The Ark was now quite a mile to the northward,\r\nbut sweeping up towards the buildings, and this, too, with a regularity\r\nof motion that satisfied Judith a white man was at the oars. When within\r\na hundred yards of the building the girls began to encircle it, in order\r\nto make sure that it was empty. No canoe was nigh, and this emboldened\r\nthem to draw nearer and nearer, until they had gone round the piles and\r\nreached the platform.\r\n\r\n"Do you go into the house, Hetty," said Judith, "and see that the\r\nsavages are gone. They will not harm you, and if any of them are still\r\nhere you can give me the alarm. I do not think they will fire on a poor\r\ndefenceless girl, and I at least may escape, until I shall be ready to\r\ngo among them of my own accord."\r\n\r\nHetty did as desired, Judith retiring a few yards from the platform the\r\ninstant her sister landed, in readiness for flight. But the last was\r\nunnecessary, not a minute elapsing before Hetty returned to communicate\r\nthat all was safe.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been in all the rooms, Judith," said the latter earnestly, "and\r\nthey are empty, except father\'s; he is in his own chamber, sleeping,\r\nthough not as quietly as we could wish."\r\n\r\n"Has any thing happened to father?" demanded Judith, as her foot touched\r\nthe platform; speaking quickly, for her nerves were in a state to be\r\neasily alarmed.\r\n\r\nHetty seemed concerned, and she looked furtively about her as if\r\nunwilling any one but a child should hear what she had to communicate,\r\nand even that she should learn it abruptly.\r\n\r\n"You know how it is with father sometimes, Judith," she said, "When\r\novertaken with liquor he doesn\'t always know what he says or does, and\r\nhe seems to be overtaken with liquor now."\r\n\r\n"That is strange! Would the savages have drunk with him, and then leave\r\nhim behind? But \'tis a grievous sight to a child, Hetty, to witness such\r\na failing in a parent, and we will not go near him \'til he wakes."\r\n\r\nA groan from the inner room, however, changed this resolution, and the\r\ngirls ventured near a parent whom it was no unusual thing for them to\r\nfind in a condition that lowers a man to the level of brutes. He was\r\nseated, reclining in a corner of the narrow room with his shoulders\r\nsupported by the angle, and his head fallen heavily on his chest. Judith\r\nmoved forward with a sudden impulse, and removed a canvass cap that was\r\nforced so low on his head as to conceal his face, and indeed all but his\r\nshoulders. The instant this obstacle was taken away, the quivering and\r\nraw flesh, the bared veins and muscles, and all the other disgusting\r\nsigns of mortality, as they are revealed by tearing away the skin,\r\nshowed he had been scalped, though still living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Lightly they\'ll talk of the spirit that\'s gone,\r\n    And o\'er his cold ashes upbraid him;\r\n    But nothing he\'ll reck, if they\'ll let him sleep on,\r\n    In the grave where a Briton has laid him."\r\n\r\n    Charles Wolfe, "The Burial of Sir John Moore," vi.\r\n\r\nThe reader must imagine the horror that daughters would experience, at\r\nunexpectedly beholding the shocking spectacle that was placed before the\r\neyes of Judith and Esther, as related in the close of the last chapter.\r\nWe shall pass over the first emotions, the first acts of filial piety,\r\nand proceed with the narrative by imagining rather than relating most of\r\nthe revolting features of the scene. The mutilated and ragged head was\r\nbound up, the unseemly blood was wiped from the face of the sufferer,\r\nthe other appliances required by appearances and care were resorted to,\r\nand there was time to enquire into the more serious circumstances of the\r\ncase. The facts were never known until years later in all their details,\r\nsimple as they were, but they may as well be related here, as it can be\r\ndone in a few words. In the struggle with the Hurons, Hutter had been\r\nstabbed by the knife of the old warrior, who had used the discretion\r\nto remove the arms of every one but himself. Being hard pushed by his\r\nsturdy foe, his knife had settled the matter. This occurred just as\r\nthe door was opened, and Hurry burst out upon the platform, as has\r\nbeen previously related. This was the secret of neither party\'s having\r\nappeared in the subsequent struggle; Hutter having been literally\r\ndisabled, and his conqueror being ashamed to be seen with the traces of\r\nblood about him, after having used so many injunctions to convince his\r\nyoung warriors of the necessity of taking their prisoners alive. When\r\nthe three Hurons returned from the chase, and it was determined to\r\nabandon the castle and join the party on the land, Hutter was simply\r\nscalped to secure the usual trophy, and was left to die by inches, as\r\nhas been done in a thousand similar instances by the ruthless warriors\r\nof this part of the American continent. Had the injury of Hutter been\r\nconfined to his head, he might have recovered, however, for it was\r\nthe blow of the knife that proved mortal. There are moments of vivid\r\nconsciousness, when the stern justice of God stands forth in colours so\r\nprominent as to defy any attempts to veil them from the sight, however\r\nunpleasant they may appear, or however anxious we may be to avoid\r\nrecognising it. Such was now the fact with Judith and Hetty, who both\r\nperceived the decrees of a retributive Providence, in the manner of\r\ntheir father\'s suffering, as a punishment for his own recent attempts\r\non the Iroquois. This was seen and felt by Judith with the keenness of\r\nperception and sensibility that were suited to her character, while\r\nthe impression made on the simpler mind of her sister was perhaps less\r\nlively, though it might well have proved more lasting.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Judith," exclaimed the weak minded girl, as soon as their first\r\ncare had been bestowed on sufferer. "Father went for scalps, himself,\r\nand now where is his own? The Bible might have foretold this dreadful\r\npunishment!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Hetty--hush, poor sister--He opens his eyes; he may hear and\r\nunderstand you. \'Tis as you say and think, but \'tis too dreadful to\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\n"Water," ejaculated Hutter, as it might be by a desperate effort, that\r\nrendered his voice frightfully deep and strong for one as near death as\r\nhe evidently was--"Water--foolish girls--will you let me die of thirst?"\r\n\r\nWater was brought and administered to the sufferer; the first he\r\nhad tasted in hours of physical anguish. It had the double effect of\r\nclearing his throat and of momentarily reviving his sinking system. His\r\neyes opened with that anxious, distended gaze which is apt to accompany\r\nthe passage of a soul surprised by death, and he seemed disposed to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Judith, inexpressibly pained by his deplorable situation,\r\nand this so much the more from her ignorance of what remedies ought\r\nto be applied--"Father, can we do any thing for you? Can Hetty and I\r\nrelieve your pain?"\r\n\r\n"Father!" slowly repeated the old man. "No, Judith; no, Hetty--I\'m no\r\nfather. She was your mother, but I\'m no father. Look in the chest--\'Tis\r\nall there--give me more water."\r\n\r\nThe girls complied, and Judith, whose early recollections extended\r\nfarther back than her sister\'s, and who on every account had more\r\ndistinct impressions of the past, felt an uncontrollable impulse of joy\r\nas she heard these words. There had never been much sympathy between her\r\nreputed father and herself, and suspicions of this very truth had often\r\nglanced across her mind, in consequence of dialogues she had overheard\r\nbetween Hutter and her mother. It might be going too far to say she had\r\nnever loved him, but it is not so to add that she rejoiced it was no\r\nlonger a duty. With Hetty the feeling was different. Incapable of\r\nmaking all the distinctions of her sister, her very nature was full\r\nof affection, and she had loved her reputed parent, though far less\r\ntenderly than the real parent, and it grieved her now to hear him\r\ndeclare he was not naturally entitled to that love. She felt a double\r\ngrief, as if his death and his words together were twice depriving her\r\nof parents. Yielding to her feelings, the poor girl went aside and wept.\r\n\r\nThe very opposite emotions of the two girls kept both silent for a long\r\ntime. Judith gave water to the sufferer frequently, but she forbore to\r\nurge him with questions, in some measure out of consideration for his\r\ncondition, but, if truth must be said, quite as much lest something he\r\nshould add in the way of explanation might disturb her pleasing belief\r\nthat she was not Thomas Hutter\'s child. At length Hetty dried her tears,\r\nand came and seated herself on a stool by the side of the dying man, who\r\nhad been placed at his length on the floor, with his head supported by\r\nsome coarse vestments that had been left in the house.\r\n\r\n"Father," she said "you will let me call you father, though you say you\r\nare not one--Father, shall I read the Bible to you--mother always said\r\nthe Bible was good for people in trouble. She was often in trouble\r\nherself, and then she made me read the Bible to her--for Judith wasn\'t\r\nas fond of the Bible as I am--and it always did her good. Many is the\r\ntime I\'ve known mother begin to listen with the tears streaming from her\r\neyes, and end with smiles and gladness. Oh! father, you don\'t know how\r\nmuch good the Bible can do, for you\'ve never tried it. Now, I\'ll read a\r\nchapter and it will soften your heart as it softened the hearts of the\r\nHurons."\r\n\r\nWhile poor Hetty had so much reverence for, and faith in, the virtues\r\nof the Bible, her intellect was too shallow to enable her fully to\r\nappreciate its beauties, or to fathom its profound and sometimes\r\nmysterious wisdom. That instinctive sense of right which appeared to\r\nshield her from the commission of wrong, and even cast a mantle of\r\nmoral loveliness and truth around her character, could not penetrate\r\nabstrusities, or trace the nice affinities between cause and effect,\r\nbeyond their more obvious and indisputable connection, though she\r\nseldom failed to see all the latter, and to defer to all their just\r\nconsequences. In a word, she was one of those who feel and act correctly\r\nwithout being able to give a logical reason for it, even admitting\r\nrevelation as her authority. Her selections from the Bible, therefore,\r\nwere commonly distinguished by the simplicity of her own mind, and were\r\noftener marked for containing images of known and palpable things than\r\nfor any of the higher cast of moral truths with which the pages of that\r\nwonderful book abound--wonderful, and unequalled, even without referring\r\nto its divine origin, as a work replete with the profoundest philosophy,\r\nexpressed in the noblest language. Her mother, with a connection that\r\nwill probably strike the reader, had been fond of the book of Job, and\r\nHetty had, in a great measure, learned to read by the frequent lessons\r\nshe had received from the different chapters of this venerable and\r\nsublime poem--now believed to be the oldest book in the world. On this\r\noccasion the poor girl was submissive to her training, and she turned to\r\nthat well known part of the sacred volume, with the readiness with which\r\nthe practised counsel would cite his authorities from the stores of\r\nlegal wisdom. In selecting the particular chapter, she was influenced by\r\nthe caption, and she chose that which stands in our English version\r\nas "Job excuseth his desire of death." This she read steadily, from\r\nbeginning to end, in a sweet, low and plaintive voice; hoping devoutly\r\nthat the allegorical and abstruse sentences might convey to the heart of\r\nthe sufferer the consolation he needed. It is another peculiarity of the\r\ncomprehensive wisdom of the Bible that scarce a chapter, unless it\r\nbe strictly narration, can be turned to, that does not contain some\r\nsearching truth that is applicable to the condition of every human\r\nheart, as well as to the temporal state of its owner, either through\r\nthe workings of that heart, or even in a still more direct form. In this\r\ninstance, the very opening sentence--"Is there not an appointed time to\r\nman on earth?" was startling, and as Hetty proceeded, Hutter applied, or\r\nfancied he could apply many aphorisms and figures to his own worldly\r\nand mental condition. As life is ebbing fast, the mind clings eagerly to\r\nhope when it is not absolutely crushed by despair. The solemn words "I\r\nhave sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why\r\nhast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to\r\nmyself," struck Hutter more perceptibly than the others, and, though too\r\nobscure for one of his blunted feelings and obtuse mind either to feel\r\nor to comprehend in their fullest extent, they had a directness of\r\napplication to his own state that caused him to wince under them.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you feel better now, father?" asked Hetty, closing the volume.\r\n"Mother was always better when she had read the Bible."\r\n\r\n"Water," returned Hutter--"give me water, Judith. I wonder if my tongue\r\nwill always be so hot! Hetty, isn\'t there something in the Bible about\r\ncooling the tongue of a man who was burning in Hell fire?"\r\n\r\nJudith turned away shocked, but Hetty eagerly sought the passage, which\r\nshe read aloud to the conscience stricken victim of his own avaricious\r\nlongings.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, poor Hetty; yes, that\'s it. My tongue wants cooling,\r\nnow--what will it be hereafter?"\r\n\r\nThis appeal silenced even the confiding Hetty, for she had no answer\r\nready for a confession so fraught with despair. Water, so long as it\r\ncould relieve the sufferer, it was in the power of the sisters to give,\r\nand from time to time it was offered to the lips of the sufferer as he\r\nasked for it. Even Judith prayed. As for Hetty, as soon as she found\r\nthat her efforts to make her father listen to her texts were no longer\r\nrewarded with success, she knelt at his side and devoutly repeated\r\nthe words which the Saviour has left behind him as a model for human\r\npetitions. This she continued to do, at intervals, as long as it seemed\r\nto her that the act could benefit the dying man. Hutter, however,\r\nlingered longer than the girls had believed possible when they first\r\nfound him. At times he spoke intelligibly, though his lips oftener moved\r\nin utterance of sounds that carried no distinct impressions\r\nto the mind. Judith listened intently, and she heard the\r\nwords--"husband"--"death"-"pirate"--"law"--"scalps"--and several others\r\nof similar import, though there was no sentence to tell the precise\r\nconnection in which they were used. Still they were sufficiently\r\nexpressive to be understood by one whose ears had not escaped all the\r\nrumours that had been circulated to her reputed father\'s discredit, and\r\nwhose comprehension was as quick as her faculties were attentive.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the painful hour that succeeded, neither of the\r\nsisters bethought her sufficiently of the Hurons to dread their return.\r\nIt seemed as if their desolation and grief placed them above the danger\r\nof such an interruption, and when the sound of oars was at length heard,\r\neven Judith, who alone had any reason to apprehend the enemy, did not\r\nstart, but at once understood that the Ark was near. She went upon the\r\nplatform fearlessly, for should it turn out that Hurry was not\r\nthere, and that the Hurons were masters of the scow also, escape was\r\nimpossible. Then she had the sort of confidence that is inspired by\r\nextreme misery. But there was no cause for any new alarm, Chingachgook,\r\nHist, and Hurry all standing in the open part of the scow, cautiously\r\nexamining the building to make certain of the absence of the enemy.\r\nThey, too, had seen the departure of the Hurons, as well as the approach\r\nof the canoe of the girls to the castle, and presuming on the latter\r\nfact, March had swept the scow up to the platform. A word sufficed to\r\nexplain that there was nothing to be apprehended, and the Ark was soon\r\nmoored in her old berth.\r\n\r\nJudith said not a word concerning the condition of her father, but Hurry\r\nknew her too well not to understand that something was more than usually\r\nwrong. He led the way, though with less of his confident bold manner\r\nthan usual, into the house, and penetrating to the inner room, found\r\nHutter lying on his back with Hetty sitting at his side, fanning him\r\nwith pious care. The events of the morning had sensibly changed the\r\nmanner of Hurry. Notwithstanding his skill as a swimmer, and the\r\nreadiness with which he had adopted the only expedient that could\r\npossibly save him, the helplessness of being in the water, bound hand\r\nand foot, had produced some such effect on him, as the near approach\r\nof punishment is known to produce on most criminals, leaving a vivid\r\nimpression of the horrors of death upon his mind, and this too in\r\nconnection with a picture of bodily helplessness; the daring of this man\r\nbeing far more the offspring of vast physical powers, than of the energy\r\nof the will, or even of natural spirit. Such heroes invariably lose a\r\nlarge portion of their courage with the failure of their strength, and\r\nthough Hurry was now unfettered and as vigorous as ever, events were too\r\nrecent to permit the recollection of his late deplorable condition to\r\nbe at all weakened. Had he lived a century, the occurrences of the few\r\nmomentous minutes during which he was in the lake would have produced a\r\nchastening effect on his character, if not always on his manner.\r\n\r\nHurry was not only shocked when he found his late associate in this\r\ndesperate situation, but he was greatly surprised. During the struggle\r\nin the building, he had been far too much occupied himself to learn what\r\nhad befallen his comrade, and, as no deadly weapon had been used in his\r\nparticular case, but every effort had been made to capture him without\r\ninjury, he naturally believed that Hutter had been overcome, while he\r\nowed his own escape to his great bodily strength, and to a fortunate\r\nconcurrence of extraordinary circumstances. Death, in the silence and\r\nsolemnity of a chamber, was a novelty to him. Though accustomed to\r\nscenes of violence, he had been unused to sit by the bedside and watch\r\nthe slow beating of the pulse, as it gradually grew weaker and weaker.\r\nNotwithstanding the change in his feelings, the manners of a life could\r\nnot be altogether cast aside in a moment, and the unexpected scene\r\nextorted a characteristic speech from the borderer.\r\n\r\n"How now! old Tom," he said, "have the vagabonds got you at an\r\nadvantage, where you\'re not only down, but are likely to be kept down!\r\nI thought you a captyve it\'s true, but never supposed you so hard run as\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\nHutter opened his glassy eyes, and stared wildly at the speaker. A flood\r\nof confused recollections rushed on his wavering mind at the sight of\r\nhis late comrade. It was evident that he struggled with his own images,\r\nand knew not the real from the unreal.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" he asked in a husky whisper, his failing strength\r\nrefusing to aid him in a louder effort of his voice.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?--You look like the mate of \'The Snow\'--he was a giant,\r\ntoo, and near overcoming us."\r\n\r\n"I\'m your mate, Floating Tom, and your comrade, but have nothing to do\r\nwith any snow. It\'s summer now, and Harry March always quits the hills\r\nas soon after the frosts set in, as is convenient."\r\n\r\n"I know you--Hurry Skurry--I\'ll sell you a scalp!--a sound one, and of a\r\nfull grown man--What\'ll you give?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Tom! That scalp business hasn\'t turned out at all profitable, and\r\nI\'ve pretty much concluded to give it up; and to follow a less bloody\r\ncalling."\r\n\r\n"Have you got any scalp? Mine\'s gone--How does it feel to have a scalp?\r\nI know how it feels to lose one--fire and flames about the brain--and\r\na wrenching at the heart--no--no--kill first, Hurry, and scalp\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"What does the old fellow mean, Judith? He talks like one that is\r\ngetting tired of the business as well as myself. Why have you bound up\r\nhis head? or, have the savages tomahawked him about the brains?"\r\n\r\n"They have done that for him which you and he, Harry March, would have\r\nso gladly done for them. His skin and hair have been torn from his head\r\nto gain money from the governor of Canada, as you would have torn theirs\r\nfrom the heads of the Hurons, to gain money from the Governor of York."\r\n\r\nJudith spoke with a strong effort to appear composed, but it was neither\r\nin her nature, nor in the feeling of the moment to speak altogether\r\nwithout bitterness. The strength of her emphasis, indeed, as well as her\r\nmanner, caused Hetty to look up reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"These are high words to come from Thomas Hutter\'s darter, as Thomas\r\nHutter lies dying before her eyes," retorted Hurry.\r\n\r\n"God be praised for that!--whatever reproach it may bring on my poor\r\nmother, I am not Thomas Hutter\'s daughter."\r\n\r\n"Not Thomas Hutter\'s darter!--Don\'t disown the old fellow in his last\r\nmoments, Judith, for that\'s a sin the Lord will never overlook. If\r\nyou\'re not Thomas Hutter\'s darter, whose darter be you?"\r\n\r\nThis question rebuked the rebellious spirit of Judith, for, in getting\r\nrid of a parent whom she felt it was a relief to find she might own\r\nshe had never loved, she overlooked the important circumstance that no\r\nsubstitute was ready to supply his place.\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you, Harry, who my father was," she answered more mildly;\r\n"I hope he was an honest man, at least."\r\n\r\n"Which is more than you think was the case with old Hutter? Well,\r\nJudith, I\'ll not deny that hard stories were in circulation consarning\r\nFloating Tom, but who is there that doesn\'t get a scratch, when an inimy\r\nholds the rake? There\'s them that say hard things of me, and even you,\r\nbeauty as you be, don\'t always escape."\r\n\r\nThis was said with a view to set up a species of community of character\r\nbetween the parties, and as the politicians are wont to express it, with\r\nulterior intentions. What might have been the consequences with one of\r\nJudith\'s known spirit, as well as her assured antipathy to the speaker,\r\nit is not easy to say, for, just then, Hutter gave unequivocal signs\r\nthat his last moment was nigh. Judith and Hetty had stood by the dying\r\nbed of their mother, and neither needed a monitor to warn them of the\r\ncrisis, and every sign of resentment vanished from the face of the\r\nfirst. Hutter opened his eyes, and even tried to feel about him with his\r\nhands, a sign that sight was failing. A minute later, his breathing\r\ngrew ghastly; a pause totally without respiration followed; and, then,\r\nsucceeded the last, long drawn sigh, on which the spirit is supposed\r\nto quit the body. This sudden termination of the life of one who had\r\nhitherto filled so important a place in the narrow scene on which he had\r\nbeen an actor, put an end to all discussion.\r\n\r\nThe day passed by without further interruption, the Hurons, though\r\npossessed of a canoe, appearing so far satisfied with their success as\r\nto have relinquished all immediate designs on the castle. It would not\r\nhave been a safe undertaking, indeed, to approach it under the rifles of\r\nthose it was now known to contain, and it is probable that the truce was\r\nmore owing to this circumstance than to any other. In the mean while the\r\npreparations were made for the interment of Hutter. To bury him on the\r\nland was impracticable, and it was Hetty\'s wish that his body should lie\r\nby the side of that of her mother, in the lake. She had it in her power\r\nto quote one of his speeches, in which he himself had called the lake\r\nthe "family burying ground," and luckily this was done without the\r\nknowledge of her sister, who would have opposed the plan, had she known\r\nit, with unconquerable disgust. But Judith had not meddled with the\r\narrangement, and every necessary disposition was made without her\r\nprivity or advice.\r\n\r\nThe hour chosen for the rude ceremony was just as the sun was setting,\r\nand a moment and a scene more suited to paying the last offices to one\r\nof calm and pure spirit could not have been chosen. There are a mystery\r\nand a solemn dignity in death, that dispose the living to regard the\r\nremains of even a malefactor with a certain degree of reverence. All\r\nworldly distinctions have ceased; it is thought that the veil has been\r\nremoved, and that the character and destiny of the departed are now as\r\nmuch beyond human opinions, as they are beyond human ken. In nothing\r\nis death more truly a leveller than in this, since, while it may be\r\nimpossible absolutely to confound the great with the low, the worthy\r\nwith the unworthy, the mind feels it to be arrogant to assume a right to\r\njudge of those who are believed to be standing at the judgment seat\r\nof God. When Judith was told that all was ready, she went upon the\r\nplatform, passive to the request of her sister, and then she first took\r\nheed of the arrangement. The body was in the scow, enveloped in a sheet,\r\nand quite a hundred weight of stones, that had been taken from the fire\r\nplace, were enclosed with it, in order that it might sink. No other\r\npreparation seemed to be thought necessary, though Hetty carried her\r\nBible beneath her arm.\r\n\r\nWhen all were on board the Ark, the singular habitation of the man whose\r\nbody it now bore to its final abode, was set in motion. Hurry was at the\r\noars. In his powerful hands, indeed, they seemed little more than a pair\r\nof sculls, which were wielded without effort, and, as he was expert in\r\ntheir use, the Delaware remained a passive spectator of the proceedings.\r\nThe progress of the Ark had something of the stately solemnity of a\r\nfuneral procession, the dip of the oars being measured, and the movement\r\nslow and steady. The wash of the water, as the blades rose and fell,\r\nkept time with the efforts of Hurry, and might have been likened to the\r\nmeasured tread of mourners. Then the tranquil scene was in beautiful\r\naccordance with a rite that ever associates with itself the idea of God.\r\nAt that instant, the lake had not even a single ripple on its glassy\r\nsurface, and the broad panorama of woods seemed to look down on the holy\r\ntranquillity of the hour and ceremony in melancholy stillness. Judith\r\nwas affected to tears, and even Hurry, though he hardly knew why, was\r\ntroubled. Hetty preserved the outward signs of tranquillity, but\r\nher inward grief greatly surpassed that of her sister, since her\r\naffectionate heart loved more from habit and long association, than\r\nfrom the usual connections of sentiment and taste. She was sustained by\r\nreligious hope, however, which in her simple mind usually occupied the\r\nspace that worldly feelings filled in that of Judith, and she was not\r\nwithout an expectation of witnessing some open manifestation of divine\r\npower, on an occasion so solemn. Still she was neither mystical nor\r\nexaggerated; her mental imbecility denying both. Nevertheless her\r\nthoughts had generally so much of the purity of a better world about\r\nthem that it was easy for her to forget earth altogether, and to think\r\nonly of heaven. Hist was serious, attentive and interested, for she\r\nhad often seen the interments of the pale-faces, though never one that\r\npromised to be as peculiar as this; while the Delaware, though grave,\r\nand also observant, in his demeanor was stoical and calm.\r\n\r\nHetty acted as pilot, directing Hurry how to proceed, to find that spot\r\nin the lake which she was in the habit of terming "mother\'s grave." The\r\nreader will remember that the castle stood near the southern extremity\r\nof a shoal that extended near half a mile northerly, and it was at the\r\nfarthest end of this shallow water that Floating Tom had seen fit to\r\ndeposit the remains of his wife and child. His own were now in the\r\ncourse of being placed at their side. Hetty had marks on the land\r\nby which she usually found the spot, although the position of the\r\nbuildings, the general direction of the shoal, and the beautiful\r\ntransparency of the water all aided her, the latter even allowing the\r\nbottom to be seen. By these means the girl was enabled to note their\r\nprogress, and at the proper time she approached March, whispering, "Now,\r\nHurry you can stop rowing. We have passed the stone on the bottom, and\r\nmother\'s grave is near."\r\n\r\nMarch ceased his efforts, immediately dropping the kedge and taking the\r\nwarp in his hand in order to check the scow. The Ark turned slowly round\r\nunder this restraint, and when it was quite stationary, Hetty was seen\r\nat its stern, pointing into the water, the tears streaming from her\r\neyes, in ungovernable natural feeling. Judith had been present at the\r\ninterment of her mother, but she had never visited the spot since. The\r\nneglect proceeded from no indifference to the memory of the deceased;\r\nfor she had loved her mother, and bitterly had she found occasion to\r\nmourn her loss; but she was averse to the contemplation of death; and\r\nthere had been passages in her own life since the day of that interment\r\nwhich increased this feeling, and rendered her, if possible, still more\r\nreluctant to approach the spot that contained the remains of one whose\r\nsevere lessons of female morality and propriety had been deepened and\r\nrendered doubly impressive by remorse for her own failings. With Hetty,\r\nthe case had been very different. To her simple and innocent mind, the\r\nremembrance of her mother brought no other feeling than one of gentle\r\nsorrow; a grief that is so often termed luxurious even, because it\r\nassociates with itself the images of excellence and the purity of a\r\nbetter state of existence. For an entire summer, she had been in\r\nthe habit of repairing to the place after night-fall; and carefully\r\nanchoring her canoe so as not to disturb the body, she would sit and\r\nhold fancied conversations with the deceased, sing sweet hymns to the\r\nevening air, and repeat the orisons that the being who now slumbered\r\nbelow had taught her in infancy. Hetty had passed her happiest hours in\r\nthis indirect communion with the spirit of her mother; the wildness\r\nof Indian traditions and Indian opinions, unconsciously to herself,\r\nmingling with the Christian lore received in childhood. Once she had\r\neven been so far influenced by the former as to have bethought her of\r\nperforming some of those physical rites at her mother\'s grave which the\r\nredmen are known to observe; but the passing feeling had been obscured\r\nby the steady, though mild light of Christianity, which never ceased\r\nto burn in her gentle bosom. Now her emotions were merely the natural\r\noutpourings of a daughter that wept for a mother whose love was\r\nindelibly impressed on the heart, and whose lessons had been too\r\nearnestly taught to be easily forgotten by one who had so little\r\ntemptation to err.\r\n\r\nThere was no other priest than nature at that wild and singular funeral\r\nrite. March cast his eyes below, and through the transparent medium of\r\nthe clear water, which was almost as pure as air, he saw what Hetty was\r\naccustomed to call "mother\'s grave." It was a low, straggling mound of\r\nearth, fashioned by no spade, out of a corner of which gleamed a bit of\r\nthe white cloth that formed the shroud of the dead. The body had been\r\nlowered to the bottom, and Hutter brought earth from the shore and let\r\nit fall upon it, until all was concealed. In this state the place had\r\nremained until the movement of the waters revealed the solitary sign of\r\nthe uses of the spot that has just been mentioned.\r\n\r\nEven the most rude and brawling are chastened by the ceremonies of a\r\nfuneral. March felt no desire to indulge his voice in any of its coarse\r\noutbreakings, and was disposed to complete the office he had undertaken\r\nin decent sobriety. Perhaps he reflected on the retribution that\r\nhad alighted on his late comrade, and bethought him of the frightful\r\njeopardy in which his own life had so lately been placed. He signified\r\nto Judith that all was ready, received her directions to proceed, and,\r\nwith no other assistant than his own vast strength, raised the body and\r\nbore it to the end of the scow. Two parts of a rope were passed beneath\r\nthe legs and shoulders, as they are placed beneath coffins, and then the\r\ncorpse was slowly lowered beneath the surface of the lake.\r\n\r\n"Not there--Harry March--no, not there," said Judith, shuddering\r\ninvoluntarily; "do not lower it quite so near the spot where mother\r\nlies!"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Judith?" asked Hetty, earnestly. "They lived together in life,\r\nand should lie together in death."\r\n\r\n"No--no--Harry March, further off--further off. Poor Hetty, you know not\r\nwhat you say. Leave me to order this."\r\n\r\n"I know I am weak-minded, Judith, and that you are clever--but, surely\r\na husband should be placed near a wife. Mother always said that this was\r\nthe way they bury in Christian churchyards."\r\n\r\nThis little controversy was conducted earnestly, but in smothered\r\nvoices, as if the speakers feared that the dead might overhear them.\r\nJudith could not contend with her sister at such a moment, but a\r\nsignificant gesture induced March to lower the body at a little distance\r\nfrom that of his wife; when he withdrew the cords, and the act was\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n"There\'s an end of Floating Tom!" exclaimed Hurry, bending over\r\nthe scow, and gazing through the water at the body. "He was a brave\r\ncompanion on a scout, and a notable hand with traps. Don\'t weep, Judith,\r\ndon\'t be overcome, Hetty, for the righteousest of us all must die; and\r\nwhen the time comes, lamentations and tears can\'t bring the dead to\r\nlife. Your father will be a loss to you, no doubt; most fathers are a\r\nloss, especially to onmarried darters; but there\'s a way to cure that\r\nevil, and you\'re both too young and handsome to live long without\r\nfinding it out. When it\'s agreeable to hear what an honest and\r\nonpretending man has to say, Judith, I should like to talk a little with\r\nyou, apart."\r\n\r\nJudith had scarce attended to this rude attempt of Hurry\'s at\r\nconsolation, although she necessarily understood its general drift, and\r\nhad a tolerably accurate notion of its manner. She was weeping at the\r\nrecollection of her mother\'s early tenderness, and painful images of\r\nlong forgotten lessons and neglected precepts were crowding her mind.\r\nThe words of Hurry, however, recalled her to the present time, and\r\nabrupt and unseasonable as was their import, they did not produce\r\nthose signs of distaste that one might have expected from the girl\'s\r\ncharacter. On the contrary, she appeared to be struck with some sudden\r\nidea, gazed intently for a moment at the young man, dried her eyes, and\r\nled the way to the other end of the scow, signifying her wish for him to\r\nfollow. Here she took a seat and motioned for March to place himself at\r\nher side. The decision and earnestness with which all this was done a\r\nlittle intimidated her companion, and Judith found it necessary to open\r\nthe subject herself.\r\n\r\n"You wish to speak to me of marriage, Harry March," she said, "and\r\nI have come here, over the grave of my parents, as it might\r\nbe--no--no--over the grave of my poor, dear, dear, mother, to hear what\r\nyou have to say."\r\n\r\n"This is oncommon, and you have a skearful way with you this evening,\r\nJudith," answered Hurry, more disturbed than he would have cared to own,\r\n"but truth is truth, and it shall come out, let what will follow. You\r\nwell know, gal, that I\'ve long thought you the comeliest young woman my\r\neyes ever beheld, and that I\'ve made no secret of that fact, either here\r\non the lake, out among the hunters and trappers, or in the settlements."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes, I\'ve heard this before, and I suppose it to be true,"\r\nanswered Judith with a sort of feverish impatience.\r\n\r\n"When a young man holds such language of any particular young woman,\r\nit\'s reasonable to calculate he sets store by her."\r\n\r\n"True--true, Hurry--all this you\'ve told me, again and again."\r\n\r\n"Well, if it\'s agreeable, I should think a woman coul\'n\'t hear it too\r\noften. They all tell me this is the way with your sex, that nothing\r\npleases them more than to repeat over and over, for the hundredth time,\r\nhow much you like \'em, unless it be to talk to \'em of their good looks!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt--we like both, on most occasions, but this is an uncommon\r\nmoment, Hurry, and vain words should not be too freely used. I would\r\nrather hear you speak plainly."\r\n\r\n"You shall have your own way, Judith, and I some suspect you always\r\nwill. I\'ve often told you that I not only like you better than any other\r\nyoung woman going, or, for that matter, better than all the young women\r\ngoing, but you must have obsarved, Judith, that I\'ve never asked you, in\r\nup and down tarms, to marry me."\r\n\r\n"I have observed both," returned the girl, a smile struggling about\r\nher beautiful mouth, in spite of the singular and engrossing intentness\r\nwhich caused her cheeks to flush and lighted her eyes with a brilliancy\r\nthat was almost dazzling--"I have observed both, and have thought the\r\nlast remarkable for a man of Harry March\'s decision and fearlessness."\r\n\r\n"There\'s been a reason, gal, and it\'s one that troubles me even now--nay,\r\ndon\'t flush up so, and look fiery like, for there are thoughts which\r\nwill stick long in any man\'s mind, as there be words that will stick in\r\nhis throat--but, then ag\'in, there\'s feelin\'s that will get the better\r\nof \'em all, and to these feelin\'s I find I must submit. You\'ve no longer\r\na father, or a mother, Judith, and it\'s morally unpossible that you and\r\nHetty could live here, alone, allowing it was peace and the Iroquois was\r\nquiet; but, as matters stand, not only would you starve, but you\'d both\r\nbe prisoners, or scalped, afore a week was out. It\'s time to think of a\r\nchange and a husband, and, if you\'ll accept of me, all that\'s past shall\r\nbe forgotten, and there\'s an end on\'t."\r\n\r\nJudith had difficulty in repressing her impatience until this rude\r\ndeclaration and offer were made, which she evidently wished to hear,\r\nand which she now listened to with a willingness that might well have\r\nexcited hope. She hardly allowed the young man to conclude, so eager was\r\nshe to bring him to the point, and so ready to answer.\r\n\r\n"There--Hurry--that\'s enough," she said, raising a hand as if to stop\r\nhim--"I understand you as well as if you were to talk a month. You\r\nprefer me to other girls, and you wish me to become your wife."\r\n\r\n"You put it in better words than I can do, Judith, and I wish you to\r\nfancy them said just as you most like to hear \'em."\r\n\r\n"They\'re plain enough, Harry, and \'tis fitting they should be so. This\r\nis no place to trifle or deceive in. Now, listen to my answer, which\r\nshall be, in every tittle, as sincere as your offer. There is a reason,\r\nMarch, why I should never--\r\n\r\n"I suppose I understand you, Judith, but if I\'m willing to overlook that\r\nreason, it\'s no one\'s consarn but mine--Now, don\'t brighten up like the\r\nsky at sundown, for no offence is meant, and none should be taken."\r\n\r\n"I do not brighten up, and will not take offence," said Judith,\r\nstruggling to repress her indignation, in a way she had never found it\r\nnecessary to exert before. "There is a reason why I should not, cannot,\r\never be your wife, Hurry, that you seem to overlook, and which it is\r\nmy duty now to tell you, as plainly as you have asked me to consent to\r\nbecome so. I do not, and I am certain that I never shall, love you well\r\nenough to marry you. No man can wish for a wife who does not prefer\r\nhim to all other men, and when I tell you this frankly, I suppose you\r\nyourself will thank me for my sincerity."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Judith, them flaunting, gay, scarlet-coated officers of the\r\ngarrisons have done all this mischief!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, March; do not calumniate a daughter over her mother\'s grave! Do\r\nnot, when I only wish to treat you fairly, give me reason to call for\r\nevil on your head in bitterness of heart! Do not forget that I am a\r\nwoman, and that you are a man; and that I have neither father, nor\r\nbrother, to revenge your words!"\r\n\r\n"Well, there is something in the last, and I\'ll say no more. Take time,\r\nJudith, and think better on this."\r\n\r\n"I want no time--my mind has long been made up, and I have only waited\r\nfor you to speak plainly, to answer plainly. We now understand each\r\nother, and there is no use in saying any more."\r\n\r\nThe impetuous earnestness of the girl awed the young man, for never\r\nbefore had he seen her so serious and determined. In most, of their\r\nprevious interviews she had met his advances with evasion or sarcasm,\r\nbut these Hurry had mistaken for female coquetry, and had supposed might\r\neasily be converted into consent. The struggle had been with himself,\r\nabout offering, nor had he ever seriously believed it possible that\r\nJudith would refuse to become the wife of the handsomest man on all that\r\nfrontier. Now that the refusal came, and that in terms so decided as to\r\nput all cavilling out of the question; if not absolutely dumbfounded,\r\nhe was so much mortified and surprised as to feel no wish to attempt to\r\nchange her resolution.\r\n\r\n"The Glimmerglass has now no great call for me," he exclaimed after\r\na minute\'s silence. "Old Tom is gone, the Hurons are as plenty on the\r\nshore as pigeons in the woods, and altogether it is getting to be an\r\nonsuitable place."\r\n\r\n"Then leave it. You see it is surrounded by dangers, and there is no\r\nreason why you should risk your life for others. Nor do I know that\r\nyou can be of any service to us. Go, to-night; we\'ll never accuse you of\r\nhaving done any thing forgetful, or unmanly."\r\n\r\n"If I do go, \'twill be with a heavy heart on your account, Judith; I\r\nwould rather take you with me."\r\n\r\n"That is not to be spoken of any longer, March; but, I will land you in\r\none of the canoes, as soon as it is dark and you can strike a trail for\r\nthe nearest garrison. When you reach the fort, if you send a party--"\r\n\r\nJudith smothered the words, for she felt that it was humiliating to be\r\nthus exposing herself to the comments and reflections of one who was not\r\ndisposed to view her conduct in connection with all in those garrisons,\r\nwith an eye of favor. Hurry, however, caught the idea, and without\r\nperverting it, as the girl dreaded, he answered to the purpose.\r\n\r\n"I understand what you would say, and why you don\'t say it." he replied.\r\n"If I get safe to the fort, a party shall start on the trail of these\r\nvagabonds, and I\'ll come with it, myself, for I should like to see you\r\nand Hetty in a place of safety, before we part forever."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Harry March, had you always spoken thus, felt thus, my feelings\r\ntowards you might have been different!"\r\n\r\n"Is it too late, now, Judith? I\'m rough and a woodsman, but we all\r\nchange under different treatment from what we have been used to."\r\n\r\n"It is too late, March. I can never feel towards you, or any other man\r\nbut one, as you would wish to have me. There, I\'ve said enough, surely,\r\nand you will question me no further. As soon as it is dark, I or the\r\nDelaware will put you on the shore. You will make the best of your way\r\nto the Mohawk, and the nearest garrison, and send all you can to our\r\nassistance. And, Hurry, we are now friends, and I may trust in you, may\r\nI not?"\r\n\r\n"Sartain, Judith; though our fri\'ndship would have been all the warmer,\r\ncould you look upon me as I look upon you."\r\n\r\nJudith hesitated, and some powerful emotion was struggling within her.\r\nThen, as if determined to look down all weaknesses, and accomplish her\r\npurposes at every hazard, she spoke more plainly.\r\n\r\n"You will find a captain of the name of Warley at the nearest post," she\r\nsaid, pale as death, and even trembling as she spoke; "I think it likely\r\nhe will wish to head the party, but I would greatly prefer it should\r\nbe another. If Captain Warley can be kept back, \'t would make me very\r\nhappy!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s easier said than done, Judith, for these officers do pretty much\r\nas they please. The Major will order, and captains, and lieutenants, and\r\nensigns must obey. I know the officer you mean, a red faced, gay, oh!\r\nbe joyful sort of a gentleman, who swallows madeira enough to drown the\r\nMohawk, and yet a pleasant talker. All the gals in the valley admire\r\nhim, and they say he admires all the gals. I don\'t wonder he is your\r\ndislike, Judith, for he\'s a very gin\'ral lover, if he isn\'t a gin\'ral\r\nofficer."\r\n\r\nJudith did not answer, though her frame shook, and her colour changed\r\nfrom pale to crimson, and from crimson back again to the hue of death.\r\n\r\n"Alas! my poor mother!" she ejaculated mentally instead of uttering it\r\naloud, "We are over thy grave, but little dost thou know how much thy\r\nlessons have been forgotten; thy care neglected; thy love defeated!"\r\n\r\nAs this goading of the worm that never dies was felt, she arose and\r\nsignified to Hurry, that she had no more to communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "That point in misery, which makes the oppressed man regardless\r\n     of his own life, makes him too Lord of the oppressor\'s."\r\n\r\n    Coleridge, Remorse, V.i.201-04.\r\n\r\nAll this time Hetty had remained seated in the head of the scow, looking\r\nsorrowfully into the water which held the body of her mother, as well\r\nas that of the man whom she had been taught to consider her father.\r\nHist stood near her in gentle quiet, but had no consolation to offer in\r\nwords. The habits of her people taught her reserve in this respect, and\r\nthe habits of her sex induced her to wait patiently for a moment when\r\nshe might manifest some soothing sympathy by means of acts, rather than\r\nof speech. Chingachgook held himself a little aloof, in grave reserve,\r\nlooking like a warrior, but feeling like a man.\r\n\r\nJudith joined her sister with an air of dignity and solemnity it was not\r\nher practice to show, and, though the gleamings of anguish were still\r\nvisible on her beautiful face, when she spoke it was firmly and without\r\ntremor. At that instant Hist and the Delaware withdrew, moving towards\r\nHurry, in the other end of the boat.\r\n\r\n"Sister," said Judith kindly, "I have much to say to you; we will get\r\ninto this canoe, and paddle off to a distance from the Ark--The secrets\r\nof two orphans ought not to be heard by every ear."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Judith, by the ears of their parents? Let Hurry lift the\r\ngrapnel and move away with the Ark, and leave us here, near the graves\r\nof father and mother, to say what we may have to say."\r\n\r\n"Father!" repeated Judith slowly, the blood for the first time since her\r\nparting with March mounting to her cheeks--"He was no father of ours,\r\nHetty! That we had from his own mouth, and in his dying moments."\r\n\r\n"Are you glad, Judith, to find you had no father! He took care of us,\r\nand fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have done no\r\nmore. I don\'t understand why he wasn\'t a father."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, dear child, but let us do as you have said. It may be well\r\nto remain here, and let the Ark move a little away. Do you prepare the\r\ncanoe, and I will tell Hurry and the Indians our wishes."\r\n\r\nThis was soon and simply done, the Ark moving with measured strokes of\r\nthe sweeps a hundred yards from the spot, leaving the girls floating,\r\nseemingly in air, above the place of the dead; so buoyant was the\r\nlight vessel that held them, and so limpid the element by which it was\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n"The death of Thomas Hutter," Judith commenced, after a short pause had\r\nprepared her sister to receive her communications, "has altered all our\r\nprospects, Hetty. If he was not our father, we are sisters, and must\r\nfeel alike and live together."\r\n\r\n"How do I know, Judith, that you wouldn\'t be as glad to find I am not\r\nyour sister, as you are in finding that Thomas Hutter, as you call him,\r\nwas not your father. I am only half witted, and few people like to\r\nhave half witted relations; and then I\'m not handsome--at least, not as\r\nhandsome as you--and you may wish a handsomer sister."\r\n\r\n"No, no Hetty. You and you only are my sister--my heart, and my love for\r\nyou tell me that--and mother was my mother--of that too am I glad, and\r\nproud; for she was a mother to be proud of--but father was not father!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Judith! His spirit may be near; it would grieve it to hear his\r\nchildren talking so, and that, too, over his very grave. Children should\r\nnever grieve parents, mother often told me, and especially when they are\r\ndead!"\r\n\r\n"Poor Hetty! They are happily removed beyond all cares on our account.\r\nNothing that I can do or say will cause mother any sorrow now--there is\r\nsome consolation in that, at least! And nothing you can say or do will\r\nmake her smile, as she used to smile on your good conduct when living."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know that, Judith. Spirits can see, and mother may see as\r\nwell as any spirit. She always told us that God saw all we did, and that\r\nwe should do nothing to offend him; and now she has left us, I strive to\r\ndo nothing that can displease her. Think how her spirit would mourn and\r\nfeel sorrow, Judith, did it see either of us doing what is not right;\r\nand spirits may see, after all; especially the spirits of parents that\r\nfeel anxious about their children."\r\n\r\n"Hetty--Hetty--you know not what you say!" murmured Judith, almost livid\r\nwith emotion--"The dead cannot see, and know nothing of what passes\r\nhere! But, we will not talk of this any longer. The bodies of Mother\r\nand Thomas Hutter lie together in the lake, and we will hope that the\r\nspirits of both are with God. That we, the children of one of them,\r\nremain on earth is certain; it is now proper to know what we are to do\r\nin future."\r\n\r\n"If we are not Thomas Hutter\'s children, Judith, no one will dispute our\r\nright to his property. We have the castle and the Ark, and the canoes,\r\nand the woods, and the lakes, the same as when he was living, and what\r\ncan prevent us from staying here, and passing our lives just as we ever\r\nhave done?"\r\n\r\n"No, no poor sister--this can no longer be. Two girls would not be safe\r\nhere, even should these Hurons fail in getting us into their power.\r\nEven father had as much as he could sometimes do, to keep peace upon the\r\nlake, and we should fail altogether. We must quit this spot, Hetty, and\r\nremove into the settlements."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you think so, Judith," returned Hetty, dropping her head on\r\nher bosom, and looking thoughtfully down at the spot where the funeral\r\npile of her mother could just be seen. "I am very sorry to hear it. I\r\nwould rather stay here, where, if I wasn\'t born, I\'ve passed my life.\r\nI don\'t like the settlements--they are full of wickedness and heart\r\nburnings, while God dwells unoffended in these hills! I love the trees,\r\nand the mountains, and the lake, and the springs; all that his bounty\r\nhas given us, and it would grieve me sorely, Judith, to be forced to\r\nquit them. You are handsome, and not at all half-witted, and one day you\r\nwill marry, and then you will have a husband, and I a brother to take\r\ncare of us, if women can\'t really take care of themselves in such a\r\nplace as this."\r\n\r\n"Ah! if this could be so, Hetty, then, indeed, I could now be a thousand\r\ntimes happier in these woods, than in the settlements. Once I did not\r\nfeel thus, but now I do. Yet where is the man to turn this beautiful\r\nplace into such a garden of Eden for us?"\r\n\r\n"Harry March loves you, sister," returned poor Hetty, unconsciously\r\npicking the bark off the canoe as she spoke. "He would be glad to be\r\nyour husband, I\'m sure, and a stouter and a braver youth is not to be\r\nmet with the whole country round."\r\n\r\n"Harry March and I understand each other, and no more need be said about\r\nhim. There is one--but no matter. It is all in the hands of providence,\r\nand we must shortly come to some conclusion about our future manner of\r\nliving. Remain here--that is, remain here, alone, we cannot--and perhaps\r\nno occasion will ever offer for remaining in the manner you think of. It\r\nis time, too, Hetty, we should learn all we can concerning our relations\r\nand family. It is not probable we are altogether without relations, and\r\nthey may be glad to see us. The old chest is now our property, and we\r\nhave a right to look into it, and learn all we can by what it holds.\r\nMother was so very different from Thomas Hutter, that, now I know we are\r\nnot his children, I burn with a desire to know whose children we can be.\r\nThere are papers in that chest, I am certain, and those papers may tell\r\nus all about our parents and natural friends."\r\n\r\n"Well, Judith, you know best, for you are cleverer than common, mother\r\nalways said, and I am only half-witted. Now father and mother are dead,\r\nI don\'t much care for any relation but you, and don\'t think I could love\r\nthem I never saw, as well as I ought. If you don\'t like to marry Hurry,\r\nI don\'t see who you can choose for a husband, and then I fear we shall\r\nhave to quit the lake, after all."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Deerslayer, Hetty?" asked Judith, bending\r\nforward like her unsophisticated sister, and endeavoring to conceal her\r\nembarrassment in a similar manner. "Would he not make a brother-in-law\r\nto your liking?"\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer!" repeated the other, looking up in unfeigned surprise.\r\n"Why, Judith, Deerslayer isn\'t in the least comely, and is altogether\r\nunfit for one like you!"\r\n\r\n"He is not ill-looking, Hetty, and beauty in a man is not of much\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so, Judith? I know that beauty is of no great matter, in\r\nman or woman, in the eyes of God, for mother has often told me so, when\r\nshe thought I might have been sorry I was not as handsome as you, though\r\nshe needn\'t have been uneasy on that account, for I never coveted any\r\nthing that is yours, sister--but, tell me so she did--still, beauty is\r\nvery pleasant to the eye, in both! I think, if I were a man, I should\r\npine more for good looks than I do as a girl. A handsome man is a more\r\npleasing sight than a handsome woman."\r\n\r\n"Poor child! You scarce know what you say, or what you mean! Beauty in\r\nour sex is something, but in men, it passes for little. To be sure,\r\na man ought to be tall, but others are tall, as well as Hurry; and\r\nactive--and I think I know those that are more active--and strong; well,\r\nhe hasn\'t all the strength in the world--and brave--I am certain I can\r\nname a youth who is braver!"\r\n\r\n"This is strange, Judith!--I didn\'t think the earth held a handsomer, or\r\na stronger, or a more active or a braver man than Hurry Harry! I\'m sure\r\nI never met his equal in either of these things."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Hetty--say no more of this. I dislike to hear you talking\r\nin this manner. \'Tis not suitable to your innocence, and truth, and\r\nwarm-hearted sincerity. Let Harry March go. He quits us to-night, and no\r\nregret of mine will follow him, unless it be that he has staid so long,\r\nand to so little purpose."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Judith; that is what I\'ve long feared--and I did so hope he might\r\nbe my brother-in-law!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind it now. Let us talk of our poor mother--and of Thomas\r\nHutter."\r\n\r\n"Speak kindly then, sister, for you can\'t be quite certain that spirits\r\ndon\'t both hear and see. If father wasn\'t father, he was good to us,\r\nand gave us food and shelter. We can\'t put any stones over their graves,\r\nhere in the water, to tell people all this, and so we ought to say it\r\nwith our tongues."\r\n\r\n"They will care little for that, girl. \'Tis a great consolation to know,\r\nHetty, that if mother ever did commit any heavy fault when young, she\r\nlived sincerely to repent of it; no doubt her sins were forgiven her."\r\n\r\n"Tisn\'t right, Judith, for children to talk of their parents\' sins. We\r\nhad better talk of our own."\r\n\r\n"Talk of your sins, Hetty!--If there ever was a creature on earth\r\nwithout sin, it is you! I wish I could say, or think the same of myself;\r\nbut we shall see. No one knows what changes affection for a good husband\r\ncan make in a woman\'s heart. I don\'t think, child, I have even now the\r\nsame love for finery I once had."\r\n\r\n"It would be a pity, Judith, if you did think of clothes, over your\r\nparents\' graves! We will never quit this spot, if you say so, and will\r\nlet Hurry go where he pleases."\r\n\r\n"I am willing enough to consent to the last, but cannot answer for the\r\nfirst, Hetty. We must live, in future, as becomes respectable young\r\nwomen, and cannot remain here, to be the talk and jest of all the rude\r\nand foul tongu\'d trappers and hunters that may come upon the lake. Let\r\nHurry go by himself, and then I\'ll find the means to see Deerslayer,\r\nwhen the future shall be soon settled. Come, girl, the sun has set,\r\nand the Ark is drifting away from us; let us paddle up to the scow, and\r\nconsult with our friends. This night I shall look into the chest, and\r\nto-morrow shall determine what we are to do. As for the Hurons, now we\r\ncan use our stores without fear of Thomas Hutter, they will be easily\r\nbought off. Let me get Deerslayer once out of their hands, and a single\r\nhour shall bring things to an understanding."\r\n\r\nJudith spoke with decision, and she spoke with authority, a habit she\r\nhad long practised towards her feeble-minded sister. But, while thus\r\naccustomed to have her way, by the aid of manner and a readier command\r\nof words, Hetty occasionally checked her impetuous feelings and hasty\r\nacts by the aid of those simple moral truths that were so deeply\r\nengrafted in all her own thoughts and feelings; shining through both\r\nwith a mild and beautiful lustre that threw a sort of holy halo around\r\nso much of what she both said and did. On the present occasion, this\r\nhealthful ascendancy of the girl of weak intellect, over her of a\r\ncapacity that, in other situations, might have become brilliant and\r\nadmired, was exhibited in the usual simple and earnest manner.\r\n\r\n"You forget, Judith, what has brought us here," she said reproachfully.\r\n"This is mother\'s grave, and we have just laid the body of father by her\r\nside. We have done wrong to talk so much of ourselves at such a spot,\r\nand ought now to pray God to forgive us, and ask him to teach us where\r\nwe are to go, and what we are to do."\r\n\r\nJudith involuntarily laid aside her paddle, while Hetty dropped on her\r\nknees, and was soon lost in her devout but simple petitions. Her sister\r\ndid not pray. This she had long ceased to do directly, though anguish of\r\nspirit frequently wrung from her mental and hasty appeals to the great\r\nsource of benevolence, for support, if not for a change of spirit.\r\nStill she never beheld Hetty on her knees, that a feeling of tender\r\nrecollection, as well as of profound regret at the deadness of her own\r\nheart, did not come over her. Thus had she herself done in childhood,\r\nand even down to the hour of her ill fated visits to the garrisons, and\r\nshe would willingly have given worlds, at such moments, to be able to\r\nexchange her present sensations for the confiding faith, those pure\r\naspirations, and the gentle hope that shone through every lineament\r\nand movement of her otherwise, less favored sister. All she could do,\r\nhowever, was to drop her head to her bosom, and assume in her attitude\r\nsome of that devotion in which her stubborn spirit refused to unite.\r\nWhen Hetty rose from her knees, her countenance had a glow and serenity\r\nthat rendered a face that was always agreeable, positively handsome.\r\nHer mind was at peace, and her conscience acquitted her of a neglect of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n"Now, you may go if you want to, Judith," she said, "for God has been\r\nkind to me, and lifted a burden off my heart. Mother had many such\r\nburdens, she used to tell me, and she always took them off in this\r\nway. \'Tis the only way, sister, such things can be done. You may raise\r\na stone, or a log, with your hands; but the heart must be lightened by\r\nprayer. I don\'t think you pray as often as you used to do, when younger,\r\nJudith!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind--never mind, child," answered the other huskily, "\'tis no\r\nmatter, now. Mother is gone, and Thomas Hutter is gone, and the time has\r\ncome when we must think and act for ourselves."\r\n\r\nAs the canoe moved slowly away from the place, under the gentle\r\nimpulsion of the elder sister\'s paddle, the younger sat musing, as was\r\nher wont whenever her mind was perplexed by any idea more abstract and\r\ndifficult of comprehension than common.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by \'future\', Judith," she at length,\r\nsuddenly observed. "Mother used to call Heaven the future, but you seem\r\nto think it means next week, or to-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"It means both, dear sister--every thing that is yet to come, whether in\r\nthis world or another. It is a solemn word, Hetty, and most so, I fear,\r\nto them that think the least about it. Mother\'s future is eternity; ours\r\nmay yet mean what will happen while we live in this world--Is not that a\r\ncanoe just passing behind the castle--here, more in the direction of\r\nthe point, I mean; it is hid, now; but certainly I saw a canoe stealing\r\nbehind the logs!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen it some time," Hetty quietly answered, for the Indians had\r\nfew terrors for her, "but I didn\'t think it right to talk about such\r\nthings over mother\'s grave! The canoe came from the camp, Judith,\r\nand was paddled by a single man. He seemed to be Deerslayer, and no\r\nIroquois."\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer!" returned the other, with much of her native\r\nimpetuosity--"That cannot be! Deerslayer is a prisoner, and I have\r\nbeen thinking of the means of setting him free. Why did you fancy it\r\nDeerslayer, child?"\r\n\r\n"You can look for yourself, sister, for there comes the canoe in sight,\r\nagain, on this side of the hut."\r\n\r\nSure enough, the light boat had passed the building, and was now\r\nsteadily advancing towards the Ark; the persons on board of which were\r\nalready collecting in the head of the scow to receive their visitor. A\r\nsingle glance sufficed to assure Judith that her sister was right, and\r\nthat Deerslayer was alone in the canoe. His approach was so calm and\r\nleisurely, however, as to fill her with wonder, since a man who had\r\neffected his escape from enemies by either artifice or violence, would\r\nnot be apt to move with the steadiness and deliberation with which his\r\npaddle swept the water. By this time the day was fairly departing, and\r\nobjects were already seen dimly under the shores. In the broad lake,\r\nhowever, the light still lingered, and around the immediate scene of the\r\npresent incidents, which was less shaded than most of the sheet, being\r\nin its broadest part, it cast a glow that bore some faint resemblance to\r\nthe warm tints of an Italian or Grecian sunset. The logs of the hut and\r\nArk had a sort of purple hue, blended with the growing obscurity, and\r\nthe bark of the hunter\'s boat was losing its distinctness in colours\r\nricher, but more mellowed, than those it showed under a bright sun.\r\nAs the two canoes approached each other--for Judith and her sister had\r\nplied their paddles so as to intercept the unexpected visiter ere\r\nhe reached the Ark--even Deerslayer\'s sun-burned countenance wore a\r\nbrighter aspect than common, under the pleasing tints that seemed to\r\ndance in the atmosphere. Judith fancied that delight at meeting her had\r\nsome share in this unusual and agreeable expression. She was not aware\r\nthat her own beauty appeared to more advantage than common, from the\r\nsame natural cause, nor did she understand what it would have given her\r\nso much pleasure to know, that the young man actually thought her, as\r\nshe drew nearer, the loveliest creature of her sex his eyes had ever\r\ndwelt on.\r\n\r\n"Welcome--welcome, Deerslayer!" exclaimed the girl, as the canoes\r\nfloated at each other\'s side; "we have had a melancholy--a frightful\r\nday--but your return is, at least, one misfortune the less! Have the\r\nHurons become more human, and let you go; or have you escaped from the\r\nwretches, by your own courage and skill?"\r\n\r\n"Neither, Judith--neither one nor t\'other. The Mingos are Mingos still,\r\nand will live and die Mingos; it is not likely their natur\'s will ever\r\nundergo much improvement. Well! They\'ve their gifts, and we\'ve our\'n,\r\nJudith, and it doesn\'t much become either to speak ill of what the Lord\r\nhas created; though, if the truth must be said, I find it a sore trial\r\nto think kindly or to talk kindly of them vagabonds. As for outwitting\r\nthem, that might have been done, and it was done, too, atween the\r\nSarpent, yonder, and me, when we were on the trail of Hist--" here the\r\nhunter stopped to laugh in his own silent fashion--"but it\'s no easy\r\nmatter to sarcumvent the sarcumvented. Even the fa\'ans get to know the\r\ntricks of the hunters afore a single season is over, and an Indian whose\r\neyes have once been opened by a sarcumvention never shuts them ag\'in\r\nin precisely the same spot. I\'ve known whites to do that, but never a\r\nred-skin. What they l\'arn comes by practice, and not by books, and\r\nof all schoolmasters exper\'ence gives lessons that are the longest\r\nremembered."\r\n\r\n"All this is true, Deerslayer, but if you have not escaped from the\r\nsavages, how came you here?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a nat\'ral question, and charmingly put. You are wonderful\r\nhandsome this evening, Judith, or Wild Rose, as the Sarpent calls you,\r\nand I may as well say it, since I honestly think it! You may well call\r\nthem Mingos, savages too, for savage enough do they feel, and savage\r\nenough will they act, if you once give them an opportunity. They feel\r\ntheir loss here, in the late skrimmage, to their hearts\' cores, and are\r\nready to revenge it on any creatur\' of English blood that may fall in\r\ntheir way. Nor, for that matter do I much think they would stand at\r\ntaking their satisfaction out of a Dutch man."\r\n\r\n"They have killed father; that ought to satisfy their wicked cravings\r\nfor blood," observed Hetty reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"I know it, gal--I know the whole story--partly from what I\'ve seen\r\nfrom the shore, since they brought me up from the point, and partly from\r\ntheir threats ag\'in myself, and their other discourse. Well, life is\r\nunsartain at the best, and we all depend on the breath of our nostrils\r\nfor it, from day to day. If you\'ve lost a staunch fri\'nd, as I make\r\nno doubt you have, Providence will raise up new ones in his stead, and\r\nsince our acquaintance has begun in this oncommon manner, I shall take\r\nit as a hint that it will be a part of my duty in futur\', should the\r\noccasion offer, to see you don\'t suffer for want of food in the wigwam.\r\nI can\'t bring the dead to life, but as to feeding the living, there\'s\r\nfew on all this frontier can outdo me, though I say it in the way\r\nof pity and consolation, like, and in no particular, in the way of\r\nboasting."\r\n\r\n"We understand you, Deerslayer," returned Judith, hastily, "and take all\r\nthat falls from your lips, as it is meant, in kindness and friendship.\r\nWould to Heaven all men had tongues as true, and hearts as honest!"\r\n\r\n"In that respect men do differ, of a sartainty, Judith. I\'ve known them\r\nthat wasn\'t to be trusted any farther than you can see them; and others\r\nag\'in whose messages, sent with a small piece of wampum, perhaps, might\r\njust as much be depended on, as if the whole business was finished afore\r\nyour face. Yes, Judith, you never said truer word, than when you said\r\nsome men might be depended on, and other some might not."\r\n\r\n"You are an unaccountable being, Deerslayer," returned the girl, not a\r\nlittle puzzled with the childish simplicity of character that the hunter\r\nso often betrayed--a simplicity so striking that it frequently appeared\r\nto place him nearly on a level with the fatuity of poor Hetty, though\r\nalways relieved by the beautiful moral truth that shone through all that\r\nthis unfortunate girl both said and did--"You are a most unaccountable\r\nman, and I often do not know how to understand you. But never mind, just\r\nnow; you have forgotten to tell us by what means you are here."\r\n\r\n"I!--Oh! That\'s not very onaccountable, if I am myself, Judith. I\'m out\r\non furlough."\r\n\r\n"Furlough!--That word has a meaning among the soldiers that I\r\nunderstand; but I cannot tell what it signifies when used by a\r\nprisoner."\r\n\r\n"It means just the same. You\'re right enough; the soldiers do use it,\r\nand just in the same way as I use it. A furlough is when a man has leave\r\nto quit a camp or a garrison for a sartain specified time; at the end\r\nof which he is to come back and shoulder his musket, or submit to his\r\ntorments, just as he may happen to be a soldier, or a captyve. Being the\r\nlast, I must take the chances of a prisoner."\r\n\r\n"Have the Hurons suffered you to quit them in this manner, without watch\r\nor guard."\r\n\r\n"Sartain--I woul\'n\'t have come in any other manner, unless indeed it had\r\nbeen by a bold rising, or a sarcumvention."\r\n\r\n"What pledge have they that you will ever return?"\r\n\r\n"My word," answered the hunter simply. "Yes, I own I gave \'em that, and\r\nbig fools would they have been to let me come without it! Why in\r\nthat case, I shouldn\'t have been obliged to go back and ondergo any\r\ndeviltries their fury may invent, but might have shouldered my rifle,\r\nand made the best of my way to the Delaware villages. But, Lord! Judith,\r\nthey know\'d this, just as well as you and I do, and would no more let me\r\ncome away, without a promise to go back, than they would let the wolves\r\ndig up the bones of their fathers!"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible you mean to do this act of extraordinary\r\nself-destruction and recklessness?"\r\n\r\n"Anan!"\r\n\r\n"I ask if it can be possible that you expect to be able to put yourself\r\nagain in the power of such ruthless enemies, by keeping your word."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer looked at his fair questioner for a moment with stern\r\ndispleasure. Then the expression of his honest and guileless face\r\nsuddenly changed, lighting as by a quick illumination of thought, after\r\nwhich he laughed in his ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t understand you, at first, Judith; no, I didn\'t! You believe\r\nthat Chingachgook and Hurry Harry won\'t suffer it; but you don\'t know\r\nmankind thoroughly yet, I see. The Delaware would be the last man on\r\n\'arth to offer any objections to what he knows is a duty, and, as for\r\nMarch, he doesn\'t care enough about any creatur\' but himself to\r\nspend many words on such a subject. If he did, \'twould make no great\r\ndifference howsever; but not he, for he thinks more of his gains than\r\nof even his own word. As for my promises, or your\'n, Judith, or any\r\nbody else\'s, they give him no consarn. Don\'t be under any oneasiness,\r\ntherefore, gal; I shall be allowed to go back according to the furlough;\r\nand if difficulties was made, I\'ve not been brought up, and edicated as\r\none may say, in the woods, without knowing how to look \'em down."\r\n\r\nJudith made no answer for some little time. All her feelings as a woman,\r\nand as a woman who, for the first time in her life was beginning to\r\nsubmit to that sentiment which has so much influence on the happiness\r\nor misery of her sex, revolted at the cruel fate that she fancied\r\nDeerslayer was drawing down upon himself, while the sense of right,\r\nwhich God has implanted in every human breast, told her to admire an\r\nintegrity as indomitable and as unpretending as that which the other so\r\nunconsciously displayed. Argument, she felt, would be useless, nor was\r\nshe at that moment disposed to lessen the dignity and high principle\r\nthat were so striking in the intentions of the hunter, by any attempt to\r\nturn him from his purpose. That something might yet occur to supersede\r\nthe necessity for this self immolation she tried to hope, and then she\r\nproceeded to ascertain the facts in order that her own conduct might be\r\nregulated by her knowledge of circumstances.\r\n\r\n"When is your furlough out, Deerslayer," she asked, after both canoes\r\nwere heading towards the Ark, and moving, with scarcely a perceptible\r\neffort of the paddles, through the water.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow noon; not a minute afore; and you may depend on it, Judith,\r\nI shan\'t quit what I call Christian company, to go and give myself up\r\nto them vagabonds, an instant sooner than is downright necessary. They\r\nbegin to fear a visit from the garrisons, and wouldn\'t lengthen the time\r\na moment, and it\'s pretty well understood atween us that, should I fail\r\nin my ar\'n\'d, the torments are to take place when the sun begins to\r\nfall, that they may strike upon their home trail as soon as it is dark."\r\n\r\nThis was said solemnly, as if the thought of what was believed to be\r\nin reserve duly weighed on the prisoner\'s mind, and yet so simply, and\r\nwithout a parade of suffering, as rather to repel than to invite any\r\nopen manifestations of sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Are they bent on revenging their losses?" Judith asked faintly, her own\r\nhigh spirit yielding to the influence of the other\'s quiet but dignified\r\nintegrity of purpose.\r\n\r\n"Downright, if I can judge of Indian inclinations by the symptoms. They\r\nthink howsever I don\'t suspect their designs, I do believe, but one that\r\nhas lived so long among men of red-skin gifts, is no more likely to be\r\nmisled in Injin feelin\'s, than a true hunter is like to lose his trail,\r\nor a stanch hound his scent. My own judgment is greatly ag\'in my own\r\nescape, for I see the women are a good deal enraged on behalf of Hist,\r\nthough I say it, perhaps, that shouldn\'t say it, seein\' that I had a\r\nconsiderable hand myself in getting the gal off. Then there was a cruel\r\nmurder in their camp last night, and that shot might just as well have\r\nbeen fired into my breast. Howsever, come what will, the Sarpent and his\r\nwife will be safe, and that is some happiness in any case."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Deerslayer, they will think better of this, since they have given\r\nyou until to-morrow noon to make up your mind!"\r\n\r\n"I judge not, Judith; yes, I judge not. An Injin is an Injin, gal, and\r\nit\'s pretty much hopeless to think of swarving him, when he\'s got the\r\nscent and follows it with his nose in the air. The Delawares, now, are a\r\nhalf Christianized tribe--not that I think such sort of Christians much\r\nbetter than your whole blooded onbelievers--but, nevertheless, what good\r\nhalf Christianizing can do to a man, some among \'em have got, and yet\r\nrevenge clings to their hearts like the wild creepers here to the tree!\r\nThen, I slew one of the best and boldest of their warriors, they say,\r\nand it is too much to expect that they should captivate the man who did\r\nthis deed, in the very same scouting on which it was performed, and\r\nthey take no account of the matter. Had a month, or so, gone by, their\r\nfeelin\'s would have been softened down, and we might have met in a more\r\nfriendly way, but it is as it is. Judith, this is talking of nothing but\r\nmyself, and my own consarns, when you have had trouble enough, and may\r\nwant to consult a fri\'nd a little about your own matters. Is the old man\r\nlaid in the water, where I should think his body would like to rest?"\r\n\r\n"It is, Deerslayer," answered Judith, almost inaudibly. "That duty has\r\njust been performed. You are right in thinking that I wish to consult a\r\nfriend; and that friend is yourself. Hurry Harry is about to leave us;\r\nwhen he is gone, and we have got a little over the feelings of this\r\nsolemn office, I hope you will give me an hour alone. Hetty and I are at\r\na loss what to do."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite nat\'ral, coming as things have, suddenly and fearfully.\r\nBut here\'s the Ark, and we\'ll say more of this when there is a better\r\nopportunity."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "The winde is great upon the highest hilles;\r\n    The quiet life is in the dale below;\r\n    Who tread on ice shall slide against their willes;\r\n    They want not cares, that curious arts should know.\r\n    Who lives at ease and can content him so,\r\n    Is perfect wise, and sets us all to schoole:\r\n    Who hates this lore may well be called a foole."\r\n\r\n    Thomas Churchyard, "Shore\'s Wife," xlvii.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Deerslayer and his friends in the Ark was grave and\r\nanxious. The two Indians, in particular, read in his manner that he was\r\nnot a successful fugitive, and a few sententious words sufficed to\r\nlet them comprehend the nature of what their friend had termed his\r\n\'furlough.\' Chingachgook immediately became thoughtful, while Hist,\r\nas usual, had no better mode of expressing her sympathy than by those\r\nlittle attentions which mark the affectionate manner of woman.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, however, something like a general plan for the\r\nproceedings of the night was adopted, and to the eye of an uninstructed\r\nobserver things would be thought to move in their ordinary train. It was\r\nnow getting to be dark, and it was decided to sweep the Ark up to the\r\ncastle, and secure it in its ordinary berth. This decision was come to,\r\nin some measure on account of the fact that all the canoes were again\r\nin the possession of their proper owners, but principally, from the\r\nsecurity that was created by the representations of Deerslayer. He had\r\nexamined the state of things among the Hurons, and felt satisfied that\r\nthey meditated no further hostilities during the night, the loss they\r\nhad met having indisposed them to further exertions for the moment.\r\nThen, he had a proposition to make; the object of his visit; and, if\r\nthis were accepted, the war would at once terminate between the parties;\r\nand it was improbable that the Hurons would anticipate the failure of a\r\nproject on which their chiefs had apparently set their hearts, by having\r\nrecourse to violence previously to the return of their messenger. As\r\nsoon as the Ark was properly secured, the different members of the party\r\noccupied themselves in their several peculiar manners, haste in council,\r\nor in decision, no more characterizing the proceedings of these border\r\nwhites, than it did those of their red neighbors. The women busied\r\nthemselves in preparations for the evening meal, sad and silent, but\r\never attentive to the first wants of nature. Hurry set about repairing\r\nhis moccasins, by the light of a blazing knot; Chingachgook seated\r\nhimself in gloomy thought, while Deerslayer proceeded, in a manner\r\nequally free from affectation and concern, to examine \'Killdeer\', the\r\nrifle of Hutter that has been already mentioned, and which subsequently\r\nbecame so celebrated, in the hands of the individual who was now making\r\na survey of its merits. The piece was a little longer than usual, and\r\nhad evidently been turned out from the work shops of some manufacturer\r\nof a superior order. It had a few silver ornaments, though, on the\r\nwhole, it would have been deemed a plain piece by most frontier men, its\r\ngreat merit consisting in the accuracy of its bore, the perfection of\r\nthe details, and the excellence of the metal. Again and again did the\r\nhunter apply the breech to his shoulder, and glance his eye along the\r\nsights, and as often did he poise his body and raise the weapon slowly,\r\nas if about to catch an aim at a deer, in order to try the weight, and\r\nto ascertain its fitness for quick and accurate firing. All this was\r\ndone, by the aid of Hurry\'s torch, simply, but with an earnestness and\r\nabstraction that would have been found touching by any spectator who\r\nhappened to know the real situation of the man.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a glorious we\'pon, Hurry!" Deerslayer at length exclaimed, "and it\r\nmay be thought a pity that it has fallen into the hands of women. The\r\nhunters have told me of its expl\'ites, and by all I have heard, I should\r\nset it down as sartain death in exper\'enced hands. Hearken to the tick\r\nof this lock--a wolf trap has\'n\'t a livelier spring; pan and cock speak\r\ntogether, like two singing masters undertaking a psalm in meetin\'. I\r\nnever did see so true a bore, Hurry, that\'s sartain!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Old Tom used to give the piece a character, though he wasn\'t the\r\nman to particularize the ra\'al natur\' of any sort of fire arms, in\r\npractise," returned March, passing the deer\'s thongs through the\r\nmoccasin with the coolness of a cobbler. "He was no marksman, that we\r\nmust all allow; but he had his good p\'ints, as well as his bad ones. I\r\nhave had hopes that Judith might consait the idee of giving Killdeer to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no saying what young women may do, that\'s a truth, Hurry, and I\r\nsuppose you\'re as likely to own the rifle as another. Still, when things\r\nare so very near perfection, it\'s a pity not to reach it entirely."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?--Would not that piece look as well on my\r\nshoulder, as on any man\'s?"\r\n\r\n"As for looks, I say nothing. You are both good-looking, and might\r\nmake what is called a good-looking couple. But the true p\'int is as to\r\nconduct. More deer would fall in one day, by that piece, in some man\'s\r\nhands, than would fall in a week in your\'n, Hurry! I\'ve seen you try;\r\nyes, remember the buck t\'other day."\r\n\r\n"That buck was out of season, and who wishes to kill venison out of\r\nseason. I was merely trying to frighten the creatur\', and I think you\r\nwill own that he was pretty well skeared, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, have it as you say. But this is a lordly piece, and would\r\nmake a steady hand and quick eye the King of the Woods!"\r\n\r\n"Then keep it, Deerslayer, and become King of the Woods," said Judith,\r\nearnestly, who had heard the conversation, and whose eye was never long\r\naverted from the honest countenance of the hunter. "It can never be in\r\nbetter hands than it is, at this moment, and there I hope it will remain\r\nthese fifty years.\r\n\r\n"Judith you can\'t be in \'arnest!" exclaimed Deerslayer, taken so much\r\nby surprise, as to betray more emotion than it was usual for him to\r\nmanifest on ordinary occasions. "Such a gift would be fit for a ra\'al\r\nKing to make; yes, and for a ra\'al King to receive."\r\n\r\n"I never was more in earnest, in my life, Deerslayer, and I am as much\r\nin earnest in the wish as in the gift."\r\n\r\n"Well, gal, well; we\'ll find time to talk of this ag\'in. You mustn\'t be\r\ndown hearted, Hurry, for Judith is a sprightly young woman, and she has\r\na quick reason; she knows that the credit of her father\'s rifle is\r\nsafer in my hands, than it can possibly be in yourn; and, therefore,\r\nyou mustn\'t be down hearted. In other matters, more to your liking, too,\r\nyou\'ll find she\'ll give you the preference."\r\n\r\nHurry growled out his dissatisfaction, but he was too intent on quitting\r\nthe lake, and in making his preparations, to waste his breath on a\r\nsubject of this nature. Shortly after, the supper was ready, and it was\r\neaten in silence as is so much the habit of those who consider the table\r\nas merely a place of animal refreshment. On this occasion, however,\r\nsadness and thought contributed their share to the general desire not to\r\nconverse, for Deerslayer was so far an exception to the usages of men of\r\nhis cast, as not only to wish to hold discourse on such occasions, but\r\nas often to create a similar desire in his companions.\r\n\r\nThe meal ended, and the humble preparations removed, the whole party\r\nassembled on the platform to hear the expected intelligence from\r\nDeerslayer on the subject of his visit. It had been evident he was in\r\nno haste to make his communication, but the feelings of Judith would no\r\nlonger admit of delay. Stools were brought from the Ark and the hut,\r\nand the whole six placed themselves in a circle, near the door, watching\r\neach other\'s countenances, as best they could, by the scanty means that\r\nwere furnished by a lovely star-light night. Along the shores, beneath\r\nthe mountains, lay the usual body of gloom, but in the broad lake no\r\nshadow was cast, and a thousand mimic stars were dancing in the limpid\r\nelement, that was just stirred enough by the evening air to set them all\r\nin motion.\r\n\r\n"Now, Deerslayer," commenced Judith, whose impatience resisted further\r\nrestraint--"now, Deerslayer, tell us all the Hurons have to say, and the\r\nreason why they have sent you on parole, to make us some offer."\r\n\r\n"Furlough, Judith; furlough is the word; and it carries the same meaning\r\nwith a captyve at large, as it does with a soldier who has leave to quit\r\nhis colors. In both cases the word is passed to come back, and now\r\nI remember to have heard that\'s the ra\'al signification; \'furlough\'\r\nmeaning a \'word\' passed for the doing of any thing of the like. Parole\r\nI rather think is Dutch, and has something to do with the tattoos of\r\nthe garrisons. But this makes no great difference, since the vartue of a\r\npledge lies in the idee, and not in the word. Well, then, if the message\r\nmust be given, it must; and perhaps there is no use in putting it off.\r\nHurry will soon be wanting to set out on his journey to the river, and\r\nthe stars rise and set, just as if they cared for neither Injin nor\r\nmessage. Ah\'s! me; \'Tisn\'t a pleasant, and I know it\'s a useless ar\'n\'d,\r\nbut it must be told."\r\n\r\n"Harkee, Deerslayer," put in Hurry, a little authoritatively--"You\'re\r\na sensible man in a hunt, and as good a fellow on a march, as a\r\nsixty-miler-a-day could wish to meet with, but you\'re oncommon slow\r\nabout messages; especially them that you think won\'t be likely to be\r\nwell received. When a thing is to be told, why tell it; and don\'t hang\r\nback like a Yankee lawyer pretending he can\'t understand a Dutchman\'s\r\nEnglish, just to get a double fee out of him."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Hurry, and well are you named to-night, seeing you\'ve\r\nno time to lose. But let us come at once to the p\'int, seeing that\'s the\r\nobject of this council--for council it may be called, though women have\r\nseats among us. The simple fact is this. When the party came back\r\nfrom the castle, the Mingos held a council, and bitter thoughts were\r\nuppermost, as was plain to be seen by their gloomy faces. No one likes\r\nto be beaten, and a red-skin as little as a pale-face. Well, when they\r\nhad smoked upon it, and made their speeches, and their council fire had\r\nburnt low, the matter came out. It seems the elders among \'em consaited\r\nI was a man to be trusted on a furlough--They\'re wonderful obsarvant,\r\nthem Mingos; that their worst mimics must allow--but they consaited I\r\nwas such a man; and it isn\'t often--" added the hunter, with a pleasing\r\nconsciousness that his previous life justified this implicit reliance\r\non his good faith--"it isn\'t often they consait any thing so good of a\r\npale-face; but so they did with me, and, therefore, they didn\'t hesitate\r\nto speak their minds, which is just this: You see the state of things.\r\nThe lake, and all on it, they fancy, lie at their marcy. Thomas Hutter\r\nis deceased, and, as for Hurry, they\'ve got the idee he has been near\r\nenough to death to-day, not to wish to take another look at him\r\nthis summer. Therefore, they account all your forces as reduced to\r\nChingachgook and the two young women, and, while they know the Delaware\r\nto be of a high race, and a born warrior, they know he\'s now on his\r\nfirst war path. As for the gals, of course they set them down much as\r\nthey do women in gin\'ral."\r\n\r\n"You mean that they despise us!" interrupted Judith, with eyes that\r\nflashed so brightly as to be observed by all present.\r\n\r\n"That will be seen in the end. They hold that all on the lake lies\r\nat their marcy, and, therefore, they send by me this belt of wampum,"\r\nshowing the article in question to the Delaware, as he spoke, "with\r\nthese words. \'Tell the Sarpent, they say, that he has done well for a\r\nbeginner; he may now strike across the mountains for his own villages,\r\nand no one shall look for his trail. If he has found a scalp, let him\r\ntake it with him, for the Huron braves have hearts, and can feel for a\r\nyoung warrior who doesn\'t wish to go home empty-handed. If he is nimble,\r\nhe is welcome to lead out a party in pursuit. Hist, howsever, must go\r\nback to the Hurons, for, when she left there in the night, she carried\r\naway by mistake, that which doesn\'t belong to her."\r\n\r\n"That can\'t be true!" said Hetty earnestly. "Hist is no such girl, but\r\none that gives every body his due--"\r\n\r\nHow much more she would have said in remonstrance cannot be known,\r\ninasmuch as Hist, partly laughing and partly hiding her face in shame,\r\npassed her own hand across the speaker\'s mouth in a way to check the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand Mingo messages, poor Hetty--" resumed Deerslayer,\r\n"which seldom mean what lies exactly uppermost. Hist has brought away\r\nwith her the inclinations of a young Huron, and they want her back\r\nagain, that the poor young man may find them where he last saw them! The\r\nSarpent they say is too promising a young warrior not to find as many\r\nwives as he wants, but this one he cannot have. That\'s their meaning,\r\nand nothing else, as I understand it."\r\n\r\n"They are very obliging and thoughtful, in supposing a young woman can\r\nforget all her own inclinations in order to let this unhappy youth find\r\nhis!" said Judith, ironically; though her manner became more bitter as\r\nshe proceeded. "I suppose a woman is a woman, let her colour be white,\r\nor red, and your chiefs know little of a woman\'s heart, Deerslayer,\r\nif they think it can ever forgive when wronged, or ever forget when it\r\nfairly loves."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s pretty much the truth with some women, Judith, though\r\nI\'ve known them that could do both. The next message is to you. They say\r\nthe Muskrat, as they called your father, has dove to the bottom of the\r\nlake; that he will never come up again, and that his young will soon\r\nbe in want of wigwams if not of food. The Huron huts, they think, are\r\nbetter than the huts of York, and they wish you to come and try them.\r\nYour colour is white, they own, but they think young women who\'ve lived\r\nso long in the woods would lose their way in the clearin\'s. A great\r\nwarrior among them has lately lost his wife, and he would be glad to put\r\nthe Wild Rose on her bench at his fireside. As for the Feeble Mind, she\r\nwill always be honored and taken care of by red warriors. Your father\'s\r\ngoods they think ought to go to enrich the tribe, but your own property,\r\nwhich is to include everything of a female natur\', will go like that\r\nof all wives, into the wigwam of the husband. Moreover, they\'ve lost a\r\nyoung maiden by violence, lately, and \'twill take two pale-faces to fill\r\nher seat."\r\n\r\n"And do you bring such a message to me," exclaimed Judith, though the\r\ntone in which the words were uttered had more in it of sorrow than of\r\nanger. "Am I a girl to be an Indian\'s slave?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish my honest thoughts on this p\'int, Judith, I shall answer\r\nthat I don\'t think you\'ll, willingly, ever become any man\'s slave;\r\nred-skin or white. You\'re not to think hard, howsever, of my bringing\r\nthe message, as near as I could, in the very words in which it was given\r\nto me. Them was the conditions on which I got my furlough, and a bargain\r\nis a bargain, though it is made with a vagabond. I\'ve told you what\r\nthey\'ve said, but I\'ve not yet told you what I think you ought, one and\r\nall, to answer."\r\n\r\n"Ay; let\'s hear that, Deerslayer," put in Hurry. "My cur\'osity is up on\r\nthat consideration, and I should like, right well, to hear your idees\r\nof the reasonableness of the reply. For my part, though, my own mind is\r\npretty much settled on the p\'int of my own answer, which shall be made\r\nknown as soon as necessary."\r\n\r\n"And so is mine, Hurry, on all the different heads, and on no one is\r\nit more sartainly settled that on your\'n. If I was you, I should\r\nsay--\'Deerslayer, tell them scamps they don\'t know Harry March! He is\r\nhuman; and having a white skin, he has also a white natur\', which natur\'\r\nwon\'t let him desart females of his own race and gifts in their greatest\r\nneed. So set me down as one that will refuse to come into your treaty,\r\nthough you should smoke a hogshead of tobacco over it.\'"\r\n\r\nMarch was a little embarrassed at this rebuke, which was uttered with\r\nsufficient warmth of manner, and with a point that left no doubt of the\r\nmeaning. Had Judith encouraged him, he would not have hesitated about\r\nremaining to defend her and her sister, but under the circumstances a\r\nfeeling of resentment rather urged him to abandon them. At all events,\r\nthere was not a sufficiency of chivalry in Hurry Harry to induce him\r\nto hazard the safety of his own person unless he could see a direct\r\nconnection between the probable consequences and his own interests.\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that his answer partook equally of his\r\nintention, and of the reliance he so boastingly placed on his gigantic\r\nstrength, which if it did not always make him outrageous, usually made\r\nhim impudent, as respects those with whom he conversed.\r\n\r\n"Fair words make long friendships, Master Deerslayer," he said a little\r\nmenacingly. "You\'re but a stripling, and you know by exper\'ence what you\r\nare in the hands of a man. As you\'re not me, but only a go between sent\r\nby the savages to us Christians, you may tell your empl\'yers that they\r\ndo know Harry March, which is a proof of their sense as well as his.\r\nHe\'s human enough to follow human natur\', and that tells him to see the\r\nfolly of one man\'s fighting a whole tribe. If females desart him, they\r\nmust expect to be desarted by him, whether they\'re of his own gifts or\r\nanother man\'s gifts. Should Judith see fit to change her mind, she\'s\r\nwelcome to my company to the river, and Hetty with her; but shouldn\'t\r\nshe come to this conclusion, I start as soon as I think the enemy\'s\r\nscouts are beginning to nestle themselves in among the brush and leaves\r\nfor the night."\r\n\r\n"Judith will not change her mind, and she does not ask your company,\r\nMaster March," returned the girl with spirit.\r\n\r\n"That p\'int\'s settled, then," resumed Deerslayer, unmoved by the other\'s\r\nwarmth. "Hurry Harry must act for himself, and do that which will be\r\nmost likely to suit his own fancy. The course he means to take will give\r\nhim an easy race, if it don\'t give him an easy conscience. Next comes\r\nthe question with Hist--what say you gal?--Will you desart your duty,\r\ntoo, and go back to the Mingos and take a Huron husband, and all not\r\nfor the love of the man you\'re to marry, but for the love of your own\r\nscalp?"\r\n\r\n"Why you talk so to Hist!" demanded the girl half-offended. "You t\'ink\r\na red-skin girl made like captain\'s lady, to laugh and joke with any\r\nofficer that come."\r\n\r\n"What I think, Hist, is neither here nor there in this matter. I must\r\ncarry back your answer, and in order to do so it is necessary that you\r\nshould send it. A faithful messenger gives his ar\'n\'d, word for word."\r\n\r\nHist no longer hesitated to speak her mind fully. In the excitement she\r\nrose from her bench, and naturally recurring to that language in which\r\nshe expressed herself the most readily, she delivered her thoughts\r\nand intentions, beautifully and with dignity, in the tongue of her own\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n"Tell the Hurons, Deerslayer," she said, "that they are as ignorant as\r\nmoles; they don\'t know the wolf from the dog. Among my people, the rose\r\ndies on the stem where it budded, the tears of the child fall on the\r\ngraves of its parents; the corn grows where the seed has been planted.\r\nThe Delaware girls are not messengers to be sent, like belts of wampum,\r\nfrom tribe to tribe. They are honeysuckles, that are sweetest in their\r\nown woods; their own young men carry them away in their bosoms, because\r\nthey are fragrant; they are sweetest when plucked from their native\r\nstems. Even the robin and the martin come back, year after year, to\r\ntheir old nests; shall a woman be less true hearted than a bird? Set the\r\npine in the clay and it will turn yellow; the willow will not flourish\r\non the hill; the tamarack is healthiest in the swamp; the tribes of the\r\nsea love best to hear the winds that blow over the salt water. As for\r\na Huron youth, what is he to a maiden of the Lenni Lenape. He may\r\nbe fleet, but her eyes do not follow him in the race; they look back\r\ntowards the lodges of the Delawares. He may sing a sweet song for the\r\ngirls of Canada, but there is no music for Wah, but in the tongue she\r\nhas listened to from childhood. Were the Huron born of the people that\r\nonce owned the shores of the salt lake, it would be in vain, unless he\r\nwere of the family of Uncas. The young pine will rise to be as high as\r\nany of its fathers. Wah-ta-Wah has but one heart, and it can love but\r\none husband."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer listened to this characteristic message, which was given\r\nwith an earnestness suited to the feelings from which it sprung, with\r\nundisguised delight, meeting the ardent eloquence of the girl, as she\r\nconcluded, with one of his own heartfelt, silent, and peculiar fits of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"That\'s worth all the wampum in the woods!" he exclaimed. "You don\'t\r\nunderstand it, I suppose, Judith, but if you\'ll look into your feelin\'s,\r\nand fancy that an inimy had sent to tell you to give up the man of your\r\nch\'ice, and to take up with another that wasn\'t the man of your ch\'ice,\r\nyou\'ll get the substance of it, I\'ll warrant! Give me a woman for ra\'al\r\neloquence, if they\'ll only make up their minds to speak what they feel.\r\nBy speakin\', I don\'t mean chatterin\', howsever; for most of them will do\r\nthat by the hour; but comm\' out with their honest, deepest feelin\'s in\r\nproper words. And now, Judith, having got the answer of a red-skin girl,\r\nit is fit I should get that of a pale-face, if, indeed, a countenance\r\nthat is as blooming as your\'n can in any wise so be tarmed. You are well\r\nnamed the Wild Rose, and so far as colour goes, Hetty ought to be called\r\nthe Honeysuckle."\r\n\r\n"Did this language come from one of the garrison gallants, I should\r\nderide it, Deerslayer, but coming from you, I know it can be depended\r\non," returned Judith, deeply gratified by his unmeditated and\r\ncharacteristic compliments. "It is too soon, however, to ask my answer;\r\nthe Great Serpent has not yet spoken."\r\n\r\n"The Sarpent! Lord; I could carry back his speech without hearing a\r\nword of it! I didn\'t think of putting the question to him at all, I\r\nwill allow; though \'twould be hardly right either, seeing that truth is\r\ntruth, and I\'m bound to tell these Mingos the fact and nothing else. So,\r\nChingachgook, let us hear your mind on this matter--are you inclined\r\nto strike across the hills towards your village, to give up Hist to\r\na Huron, and to tell the chiefs at home that, if they\'re actyve and\r\nsuccessful, they may possibly get on the end of the Iroquois trail some\r\ntwo or three days a\'ter the inimy has got off of it?"\r\n\r\nLike his betrothed, the young chief arose, that his answer might be\r\ngiven with due distinctness and dignity. Hist had spoken with her hands\r\ncrossed upon her bosom, as if to suppress the emotions within, but the\r\nwarrior stretched an arm before him with a calm energy that aided in\r\ngiving emphasis to his expressions. "Wampum should be sent for wampum,"\r\nhe said; "a message must be answered by a message. Hear what the Great\r\nSerpent of the Delawares has to say to the pretended wolves from the\r\ngreat lakes, that are howling through our woods. They are no wolves;\r\nthey are dogs that have come to get their tails and ears cropped by the\r\nhands of the Delawares. They are good at stealing young women; bad at\r\nkeeping them. Chingachgook takes his own where he finds it; he asks\r\nleave of no cur from the Canadas. If he has a tender feeling in his\r\nheart, it is no business of the Hurons. He tells it to her who most\r\nlikes to know it; he will not bellow it in the forest, for the ears of\r\nthose that only understand yells of terror. What passes in his lodge\r\nis not for the chiefs of his own people to know; still less for Mingo\r\nrogues--"\r\n\r\n"Call \'em vagabonds, Sarpent--" interrupted Deerslayer, unable to\r\nrestrain his delight--"yes, just call \'em up-and-down vagabonds, which\r\nis a word easily intarpreted, and the most hateful of all to their ears,\r\nit\'s so true. Never fear me; I\'ll give em your message, syllable for\r\nsyllable, sneer for sneer, idee for idee, scorn for scorn, and they\r\ndesarve no better at your hands--only call \'em vagabonds, once or twice,\r\nand that will set the sap mounting in \'em, from their lowest roots to\r\nthe uppermost branches!"\r\n\r\n"Still less for Mingo vagabonds," resumed Chingachgook, quite willingly\r\ncomplying with his friend\'s request. "Tell the Huron dogs to howl\r\nlouder, if they wish a Delaware to find them in the woods, where they\r\nburrow like foxes, instead of hunting like warriors. When they had a\r\nDelaware maiden in their camp, there was a reason for hunting them up;\r\nnow they will be forgotten unless they make a noise. Chingachgook don\'t\r\nlike the trouble of going to his villages for more warriors; he can\r\nstrike their run-a-way trail; unless they hide it under ground, he will\r\nfollow it to Canada alone. He will keep Wah-ta-Wah with him to cook his\r\ngame; they two will be Delawares enough to scare all the Hurons back to\r\ntheir own country."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a grand despatch, as the officers call them things!"\r\ncried Deerslayer; "\'twill set all the Huron blood in motion; most\r\nparticularily that part where he tells \'em Hist, too, will keep on their\r\nheels \'til they\'re fairly driven out of the country. Ahs! me; big words\r\nain\'t always big deeds, notwithstanding! The Lord send that we be able\r\nto be only one half as good as we promise to be! And now, Judith, it\'s\r\nyour turn to speak, for them miscreants will expect an answer from each\r\nperson, poor Hetty, perhaps, excepted."\r\n\r\n"And why not Hetty, Deerslayer? She often speaks to the purpose;\r\nthe Indians may respect her words, for they feel for people in her\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"That is true, Judith, and quick-thoughted in you. The red-skins do\r\nrespect misfortunes of all kinds, and Hetty\'s in particular. So, Hetty,\r\nif you have any thing to say, I\'ll carry it to the Hurons as faithfully\r\nas if it was spoken by a schoolmaster, or a missionary."\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment, and then she answered in her own gentle,\r\nsoft tones, as earnestly as any who had preceded her.\r\n\r\n"The Hurons can\'t understand the difference between white people and\r\nthemselves," she said, "or they wouldn\'t ask Judith and me to go and\r\nlive in their villages. God has given one country to the red men and\r\nanother to us. He meant us to live apart. Then mother always said that\r\nwe should never dwell with any but Christians, if possible, and that\r\nis a reason why we can\'t go. This lake is ours, and we won\'t leave it.\r\nFather and mother\'s graves are in it, and even the worst Indians love to\r\nstay near the graves of their fathers. I will come and see them again,\r\nif they wish me to, and read more out of the Bible to them, but I can\'t\r\nquit father\'s and mother\'s graves."\r\n\r\n"That will do--that will do, Hetty, just as well as if you sent them\r\na message twice as long," interrupted the hunter. "I\'ll tell \'em all\r\nyou\'ve said, and all you mean, and I\'ll answer for it that they\'ll be\r\neasily satisfied. Now, Judith, your turn comes next, and then this part\r\nof my ar\'n\'d will be tarminated for the night."\r\n\r\nJudith manifested a reluctance to give her reply, that had awakened a\r\nlittle curiosity in the messenger. Judging from her known spirit, he had\r\nnever supposed the girl would be less true to her feelings and principles\r\nthan Hist, or Hetty, and yet there was a visible wavering of purpose\r\nthat rendered him slightly uneasy. Even now when directly required\r\nto speak, she seemed to hesitate, nor did she open her lips until the\r\nprofound silence told her how anxiously her words were expected. Then,\r\nindeed, she spoke, but it was doubtingly and with reluctance.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, first--tell us, first, Deerslayer," she commenced, repeating\r\nthe words merely to change the emphasis--"what effect will our answers\r\nhave on your fate? If you are to be the sacrifice of our spirit, it\r\nwould have been better had we all been more wary as to the language we\r\nuse. What, then, are likely to be the consequences to yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Lord, Judith, you might as well ask me which way the wind will blow\r\nnext week, or what will be the age of the next deer that will be shot! I\r\ncan only say that their faces look a little dark upon me, but it doesn\'t\r\nthunder every time a black cloud rises, nor does every puff of wind\r\nblow up rain. That\'s a question, therefore, much more easily put than\r\nanswered."\r\n\r\n"So is this message of the Iroquois to me," answered Judith rising,\r\nas if she had determined on her own course for the present. "My answer\r\nshall be given, Deerslayer, after you and I have talked together alone,\r\nwhen the others have laid themselves down for the night."\r\n\r\nThere was a decision in the manner of the girl that disposed Deerslayer\r\nto comply, and this he did the more readily as the delay could produce\r\nno material consequences one way or the other. The meeting now broke up,\r\nHurry announcing his resolution to leave them speedily. During the hour\r\nthat was suffered to intervene, in order that the darkness might deepen\r\nbefore the frontierman took his departure, the different individuals\r\noccupied themselves in their customary modes, the hunter, in particular,\r\npassing most of the time in making further enquiries into the perfection\r\nof the rifle already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe hour of nine soon arrived, however, and then it had been determined\r\nthat Hurry should commence his journey. Instead of making his adieus\r\nfrankly, and in a generous spirit, the little he thought it necessary\r\nto say was uttered sullenly and in coldness. Resentment at what he\r\nconsidered Judith\'s obstinacy was blended with mortification at the\r\ncareer he had since reaching the lake, and, as is usual with the vulgar\r\nand narrow-minded, he was more disposed to reproach others with his\r\nfailures than to censure himself. Judith gave him her hand, but it was\r\nquite as much in gladness as with regret, while the two Delawares were\r\nnot sorry to find he was leaving them. Of the whole party, Hetty alone\r\nbetrayed any real feeling. Bashfulness, and the timidity of her sex and\r\ncharacter, kept even her aloof, so that Hurry entered the canoe, where\r\nDeerslayer was already waiting for him, before she ventured near enough\r\nto be observed. Then, indeed, the girl came into the Ark and approached\r\nits end, just as the little bark was turning from it, with a movement\r\nso light and steady as to be almost imperceptible. An impulse of feeling\r\nnow overcame her timidity, and Hetty spoke.\r\n\r\n"Goodbye Hurry--" she called out, in her sweet voice--"goodbye, dear\r\nHurry. Take care of yourself in the woods, and don\'t stop once, \'til you\r\nreach the garrison. The leaves on the trees are scarcely plentier than\r\nthe Hurons round the lake, and they\'ll not treat a strong man like you\r\nas kindly as they treat me."\r\n\r\nThe ascendency which March had obtained over this feebleminded, but\r\nright-thinking, and right-feeling girl, arose from a law of nature. Her\r\nsenses had been captivated by his personal advantages, and her moral\r\ncommunications with him had never been sufficiently intimate to\r\ncounteract an effect that must have been otherwise lessened, even with\r\none whose mind was as obtuse as her own. Hetty\'s instinct of right, if\r\nsuch a term can be applied to one who seemed taught by some kind spirit\r\nhow to steer her course with unerring accuracy, between good and evil,\r\nwould have revolted at Hurry\'s character on a thousand points, had there\r\nbeen opportunities to enlighten her, but while he conversed and trifled\r\nwith her sister, at a distance from herself, his perfection of form\r\nand feature had been left to produce their influence on her simple\r\nimagination and naturally tender feelings, without suffering by the\r\nalloy of his opinions and coarseness. It is true she found him rough and\r\nrude; but her father was that, and most of the other men she had seen,\r\nand that which she believed to belong to all of the sex struck her less\r\nunfavorably in Hurry\'s character than it might otherwise have done.\r\nStill, it was not absolutely love that Hetty felt for Hurry, nor do\r\nwe wish so to portray it, but merely that awakening sensibility and\r\nadmiration, which, under more propitious circumstances, and always\r\nsupposing no untoward revelations of character on the part of the young\r\nman had supervened to prevent it, might soon have ripened into that\r\nengrossing feeling. She felt for him an incipient tenderness, but\r\nscarcely any passion. Perhaps the nearest approach to the latter that\r\nHetty had manifested was to be seen in the sensitiveness which had\r\ncaused her to detect March\'s predilection for her sister, for, among\r\nJudith\'s many admirers, this was the only instance in which the\r\ndull mind of the girl had been quickened into an observation of the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHurry received so little sympathy at his departure that the gentle tones\r\nof Hetty, as she thus called after him, sounded soothingly. He checked\r\nthe canoe, and with one sweep of his powerful arm brought it back to the\r\nside of the Ark. This was more than Hetty, whose courage had risen with\r\nthe departure of her hero, expected, and she now shrunk timidly back at\r\nthis unexpected return.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good gal, Hetty, and I can\'t quit you without shaking hands,"\r\nsaid March kindly. "Judith, a\'ter all, isn\'t worth as much as you,\r\nthough she may be a trifle better looking. As to wits, if honesty and\r\nfair dealing with a young man is a sign of sense in a young woman,\r\nyou\'re worth a dozen Judiths; ay, and for that matter, most young women\r\nof my acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say any thing against Judith, Harry," returned Hetty imploringly.\r\n"Father\'s gone, and mother\'s gone, and nobody\'s left but Judith and me,\r\nand it isn\'t right for sisters to speak evil, or to hear evil of each\r\nother. Father\'s in the lake, and so is mother, and we should all fear\r\nGod, for we don\'t know when we may be in the lake, too."\r\n\r\n"That sounds reasonable, child, as does most you say. Well, if we ever\r\nmeet ag\'in, Hetty, you\'ll find a fri\'nd in me, let your sister do what\r\nshe may. I was no great fri\'nd of your mother I\'ll allow, for we didn\'t\r\nthink alike on most p\'ints, but then your father, Old Tom, and I,\r\nfitted each other as remarkably as a buckskin garment will fit any\r\nreasonable-built man. I\'ve always been unanimous of opinion that Old\r\nFloating Tom Hutter, at the bottom, was a good fellow, and will maintain\r\nthat ag\'in all inimies for his sake, as well as for your\'n."\r\n\r\n"Goodbye, Hurry," said Hetty, who now wanted to hasten the young man\r\noff, as ardently as she had wished to keep him only the moment before,\r\nthough she could give no clearer account of the latter than of the\r\nformer feeling; "goodbye, Hurry; take care of yourself in the woods;\r\ndon\'t halt \'til you reach the garrison. I\'ll read a chapter in the Bible\r\nfor you before I go to bed, and think of you in my prayers."\r\n\r\nThis was touching a point on which March had no sympathies, and without\r\nmore words, he shook the girl cordially by the hand and re-entered the\r\ncanoe. In another minute the two adventurers were a hundred feet from\r\nthe Ark, and half a dozen had not elapsed before they were completely\r\nlost to view. Hetty sighed deeply, and rejoined her sister and Hist.\r\n\r\nFor some time Deerslayer and his companion paddled ahead in silence.\r\nIt had been determined to land Hurry at the precise point where he is\r\nrepresented, in the commencement of our tale, as having embarked, not\r\nonly as a place little likely to be watched by the Hurons, but because\r\nhe was sufficiently familiar with the signs of the woods, at that spot,\r\nto thread his way through them in the dark. Thither, then, the light\r\ncraft proceeded, being urged as diligently and as swiftly as two\r\nvigorous and skilful canoemen could force their little vessel through,\r\nor rather over, the water. Less than a quarter of an hour sufficed for\r\nthe object, and, at the end of that time, being within the shadows of\r\nthe shore, and quite near the point they sought, each ceased his efforts\r\nin order to make their parting communications out of earshot of any\r\nstraggler who might happen to be in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n"You will do well to persuade the officers at the garrison to lead out\r\na party ag\'in these vagabonds as soon as you git in, Hurry," Deerslayer\r\ncommenced; "and you\'ll do better if you volunteer to guide it up\r\nyourself. You know the paths, and the shape of the lake, and the natur\'\r\nof the land, and can do it better than a common, gin\'ralizing scout.\r\nStrike at the Huron camp first, and follow the signs that will then show\r\nthemselves. A few looks at the hut and the Ark will satisfy you as to\r\nthe state of the Delaware and the women, and, at any rate, there\'ll be\r\na fine opportunity to fall on the Mingo trail, and to make a mark on the\r\nmemories of the blackguards that they\'ll be apt to carry with \'em a long\r\ntime. It won\'t be likely to make much difference with me, since that\r\nmatter will be detarmined afore to-morrow\'s sun has set, but it may make\r\na great change in Judith and Hetty\'s hopes and prospects!"\r\n\r\n"And as for yourself, Nathaniel," Hurry enquired with more interest\r\nthan he was accustomed to betray in the welfare of others--"And, as for\r\nyourself, what do you think is likely to turn up?"\r\n\r\n"The Lord, in his wisdom, only can tell, Henry March! The clouds look\r\nblack and threatening, and I keep my mind in a state to meet the worst.\r\nVengeful feelin\'s are uppermost in the hearts of the Mingos, and any\r\nlittle disapp\'intment about the plunder, or the prisoners, or Hist, may\r\nmake the torments sartain. The Lord, in his wisdom, can only detarmine\r\nmy fate, or your\'n!"\r\n\r\n"This is a black business, and ought to be put a stop to in some way or\r\nother--" answered Hurry, confounding the distinctions between right and\r\nwrong, as is usual with selfish and vulgar men. "I heartily wish old\r\nHutter and I had scalped every creatur\' in their camp, the night\r\nwe first landed with that capital object! Had you not held back,\r\nDeerslayer, it might have been done, and then you wouldn\'t have found\r\nyourself, at the last moment, in the desperate condition you mention."\r\n\r\n"\'Twould have been better had you said you wished you had never\r\nattempted to do what it little becomes any white man\'s gifts to\r\nundertake; in which case, not only might we have kept from coming to\r\nblows, but Thomas Hutter would now have been living, and the hearts of\r\nthe savages would be less given to vengeance. The death of that young\r\nwoman, too, was on-called for, Henry March, and leaves a heavy load on\r\nour names if not on our consciences!"\r\n\r\nThis was so apparent, and it seemed so obvious to Hurry himself, at the\r\nmoment, that he dashed his paddle into the water, and began to urge the\r\ncanoe towards the shore, as if bent only on running away from his own\r\nlively remorse. His companion humoured this feverish desire for change,\r\nand, in a minute or two, the bows of the boat grated lightly on the\r\nshingle of the beach. To land, shoulder his pack and rifle, and to get\r\nready for his march occupied Hurry but an instant, and with a growling\r\nadieu, he had already commenced his march, when a sudden twinge of\r\nfeeling brought him to a dead stop, and immediately after to the other\'s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"You cannot mean to give yourself up ag\'in to them murdering savages,\r\nDeerslayer!" he said, quite as much in angry remonstrance, as with\r\ngenerous feeling. "\'Twould be the act of a madman or a fool!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s them that thinks it madness to keep their words, and there\'s\r\nthem that don\'t, Hurry Harry. You may be one of the first, but I\'m one\r\nof the last. No red-skin breathing shall have it in his power to say\r\nthat a Mingo minds his word more than a man of white blood and white\r\ngifts, in any thing that consarns me. I\'m out on a furlough, and if I\'ve\r\nstrength and reason, I\'ll go in on a furlough afore noon to-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s an Injin, or a word passed, or a furlough taken from creatur\'s\r\nlike them, that have neither souls, nor reason!"\r\n\r\n"If they\'ve got neither souls nor reason, you and I have both, Henry\r\nMarch, and one is accountable for the other. This furlough is not, as\r\nyou seem to think, a matter altogether atween me and the Mingos, seeing\r\nit is a solemn bargain made atween me and God. He who thinks that he\r\ncan say what he pleases, in his distress, and that twill all pass for\r\nnothing, because \'tis uttered in the forest, and into red men\'s ears,\r\nknows little of his situation, and hopes, and wants. The woods are but\r\nthe ears of the Almighty, the air is his breath, and the light of the\r\nsun is little more than a glance of his eye. Farewell, Harry; we may not\r\nmeet ag\'in, but I would wish you never to treat a furlough, or any other\r\nsolemn thing that your Christian God has been called on to witness, as\r\na duty so light that it may be forgotten according to the wants of the\r\nbody, or even accordin\' to the cravings of the spirit."\r\n\r\nMarch was now glad again to escape. It was quite impossible that he\r\ncould enter into the sentiments that ennobled his companion, and he\r\nbroke away from both with an impatience that caused him secretly to\r\ncurse the folly that could induce a man to rush, as it were, on his own\r\ndestruction. Deerslayer, on the contrary, manifested no such excitement.\r\nSustained by his principles, inflexible in the purpose of acting up to\r\nthem, and superior to any unmanly apprehension, he regarded all before\r\nhim as a matter of course, and no more thought of making any unworthy\r\nattempt to avoid it, than a Mussulman thinks of counteracting the\r\ndecrees of Providence. He stood calmly on the shore, listening to\r\nthe reckless tread with which Hurry betrayed his progress through the\r\nbushes, shook his head in dissatisfaction at the want of caution, and\r\nthen stepped quietly into his canoe. Before he dropped the paddle again\r\ninto the water, the young man gazed about him at the scene presented by\r\nthe star-lit night. This was the spot where he had first laid his eyes\r\non the beautiful sheet of water on which he floated. If it was then\r\nglorious in the bright light of a summer\'s noon-tide, it was now sad and\r\nmelancholy under the shadows of night. The mountains rose around it like\r\nblack barriers to exclude the outer world, and the gleams of pale light\r\nthat rested on the broader parts of the basin were no bad symbols of\r\nthe faintness of the hopes that were so dimly visible in his own future.\r\nSighing heavily, he pushed the canoe from the land, and took his way\r\nback with steady diligence towards the Ark and the castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame;\r\n    Thy private feasting to a public fast;\r\n    Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name;\r\n    Thy sugar\'d tongue to bitter worm wood taste:\r\n    Thy violent vanities can never last."\r\n\r\n    Shakespeare, Rape of Lucrece, 11.  890-94.\r\n\r\nJudith was waiting the return of Deerslayer on the platform, with\r\nstifled impatience, when the latter reached the hut. Hist and Hetty were\r\nboth in a deep sleep, on the bed usually occupied by the two daughters\r\nof the house, and the Delaware was stretched on the floor of the\r\nadjoining room, his rifle at his side, and a blanket over him, already\r\ndreaming of the events of the last few days. There was a lamp burning\r\nin the Ark, for the family was accustomed to indulge in this luxury on\r\nextraordinary occasions, and possessed the means, the vessel being of a\r\nform and material to render it probable it had once been an occupant of\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the girl got a glimpse of the canoe, she ceased her hurried\r\nwalk up and down the platform and stood ready to receive the young man,\r\nwhose return she had now been anxiously expecting for some time. She\r\nhelped him to fasten the canoe, and by aiding in the other little\r\nsimilar employments, manifested her desire to reach a moment of liberty\r\nas soon as possible. When this was done, in answer to an inquiry of his,\r\nshe informed him of the manner in which their companions had disposed of\r\nthemselves. He listened attentively, for the manner of the girl was so\r\nearnest and impressive as to apprise him that she had something on her\r\nmind of more than common concern.\r\n\r\n"And now, Deerslayer," Judith continued, "you see I have lighted the\r\nlamp, and put it in the cabin of the Ark. That is never done with\r\nus, unless on great occasions, and I consider this night as the most\r\nimportant of my life. Will you follow me and see what I have to show\r\nyou--hear what I have to say."\r\n\r\nThe hunter was a little surprised, but, making no objections, both were\r\nsoon in the scow, and in the room that contained the light. Here two\r\nstools were placed at the side of the chest, with the lamp on another,\r\nand a table near by to receive the different articles as they might\r\nbe brought to view. This arrangement had its rise in the feverish\r\nimpatience of the girl, which could brook no delay that it was in\r\nher power to obviate. Even all the padlocks were removed, and it only\r\nremained to raise the heavy lid, again, to expose all the treasures of\r\nthis long secreted hoard.\r\n\r\n"I see, in part, what all this means," observed Deerslayer--"yes, I see\r\nthrough it, in part. But why is not Hetty present? Now Thomas Hutter is\r\ngone, she is one of the owners of these cur\'osities, and ought to see\r\nthem opened and handled."\r\n\r\n"Hetty sleeps--" answered Judith, huskily. "Happily for her, fine\r\nclothes and riches have no charms. Besides she has this night given her\r\nshare of all that the chest may hold to me, that I may do with it as I\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"Is poor Hetty compass enough for that, Judith?" demanded the\r\njust-minded young man. "It\'s a good rule and a righteous one, never to\r\ntake when them that give don\'t know the valie of their gifts; and such\r\nas God has visited heavily in their wits ought to be dealt with as\r\ncarefully as children that haven\'t yet come to their understandings."\r\n\r\nJudith was hurt at this rebuke, coming from the person it did, but\r\nshe would have felt it far more keenly had not her conscience fully\r\nacquitted her of any unjust intentions towards her feeble-minded but\r\nconfiding sister. It was not a moment, however, to betray any of her\r\nusual mountings of the spirit, and she smothered the passing sensation\r\nin the desire to come to the great object she had in view.\r\n\r\n"Hetty will not be wronged," she mildly answered; "she even knows not\r\nonly what I am about to do, Deerslayer, but why I do it. So take your\r\nseat, raise the lid of the chest, and this time we will go to the\r\nbottom. I shall be disappointed if something is not found to tell us\r\nmore of the history of Thomas Hutter and my mother."\r\n\r\n"Why Thomas Hutter, Judith, and not your father? The dead ought to meet\r\nwith as much reverence as the living!"\r\n\r\n"I have long suspected that Thomas Hutter was not my father, though I\r\ndid think he might have been Hetty\'s, but now we know he was the father\r\nof neither. He acknowledged that much in his dying moments. I am old\r\nenough to remember better things than we have seen on this lake, though\r\nthey are so faintly impressed on my memory that the earlier part of my\r\nlife seems like a dream."\r\n\r\n"Dreams are but miserable guides when one has to detarmine about\r\nrealities, Judith," returned the other admonishingly. "Fancy nothing and\r\nhope nothing on their account, though I\'ve known chiefs that thought \'em\r\nuseful."\r\n\r\n"I expect nothing for the future from them, my good friend, but cannot\r\nhelp remembering what has been. This is idle, however, when half an hour\r\nof examination may tell us all, or even more than I want to know."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer, who comprehended the girl\'s impatience, now took his seat\r\nand proceeded once more to bring to light the different articles that\r\nthe chest contained. As a matter of course, all that had been previously\r\nexamined were found where they had been last deposited, and they excited\r\nmuch less interest or comment than when formerly exposed to view. Even\r\nJudith laid aside the rich brocade with an air of indifference, for she\r\nhad a far higher aim before her than the indulgence of vanity, and was\r\nimpatient to come at the still hidden, or rather unknown, treasures.\r\n\r\n"All these we have seen before," she said, "and will not stop to open.\r\nThe bundle under your hand, Deerslayer, is a fresh one; that we will\r\nlook into. God send it may contain something to tell poor Hetty and\r\nmyself who we really are!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, if some bundles could speak, they might tell wonderful secrets,"\r\nreturned the young man deliberately undoing the folds of another piece\r\nof course canvass, in order to come at the contents of the roll that lay\r\non his knees: "though this doesn\'t seem to be one of that family, seeing\r\n\'tis neither more nor less than a sort of flag, though of what nation,\r\nit passes my l\'arnin\' to say."\r\n\r\n"That flag must have some meaning to it--" Judith hurriedly interposed.\r\n"Open it wider, Deerslayer, that we may see the colours."\r\n\r\n"Well, I pity the ensign that has to shoulder this cloth, and to parade\r\nit about on the field. Why \'tis large enough, Judith, to make a dozen of\r\nthem colours the King\'s officers set so much store by. These can be no\r\nensign\'s colours, but a gin\'ral\'s!"\r\n\r\n"A ship might carry it, Deerslayer, and ships I know do use such things.\r\nHave you never heard any fearful stories about Thomas Hutter\'s having\r\nonce been concerned with the people they call buccaneers?"\r\n\r\n"Buck-ah-near! Not I--not I--I never heard him mentioned as good at a\r\nbuck far off, or near by. Hurry Harry did till me something about its\r\nbeing supposed that he had formerly, in some way or other, dealings with\r\nsartain sea robbers, but, Lord, Judith, it can\'t surely give you any\r\nsatisfaction to make out that ag\'in your mother\'s own husband, though he\r\nisn\'t your father."\r\n\r\n"Anything will give me satisfaction that tells me who I am, and helps to\r\nexplain the dreams of childhood. My mother\'s husband! Yes, he must have\r\nbeen that, though why a woman like her, should have chosen a man like\r\nhim, is more than mortal reason can explain. You never saw mother,\r\nDeerslayer, and can\'t feel the vast, vast difference there was between\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Such things do happen, howsever;--yes, they do happen; though why\r\nprovidence lets them come to pass is more than I understand. I\'ve knew\r\nthe f\'ercest warriors with the gentlest wives of any in the tribe, and\r\nawful scolds fall to the lot of Injins fit to be missionaries."\r\n\r\n"That was not it, Deerslayer; that was not it. Oh! if it should prove\r\nthat--no; I cannot wish she should not have been his wife at all. That\r\nno daughter can wish for her own mother! Go on, now, and let us see what\r\nthe square looking bundle holds."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer complied, and he found that it contained a small trunk of\r\npretty workmanship, but fastened. The next point was to find a key; but,\r\nsearch proving ineffectual, it was determined to force the lock. This\r\nDeerslayer soon effected by the aid of an iron instrument, and it\r\nwas found that the interior was nearly filled with papers. Many were\r\nletters; some fragments of manuscripts, memorandums, accounts, and other\r\nsimilar documents. The hawk does not pounce upon the chicken with a more\r\nsudden swoop than Judith sprang forward to seize this mine of hitherto\r\nconcealed knowledge. Her education, as the reader will have perceived,\r\nwas far superior to her situation in life, and her eye glanced over page\r\nafter page of the letters with a readiness that her schooling supplied,\r\nand with an avidity that found its origin in her feelings. At first it\r\nwas evident that the girl was gratified; and we may add with reason, for\r\nthe letters written by females, in innocence and affection, were of a\r\ncharacter to cause her to feel proud of those with whom she had every\r\nreason to think she was closely connected by the ties of blood. It does\r\nnot come within the scope of our plan to give more of these epistles,\r\nhowever, than a general idea of their contents, and this will best be\r\ndone by describing the effect they produced on the manner, appearance,\r\nand feeling of her who was so eagerly perusing them.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, already, that Judith was much gratified with the\r\nletters that first met her eye. They contained the correspondence of\r\nan affectionate and inteffigent mother to an absent daughter, with such\r\nallusions to the answers as served in a great measure to fill up the\r\nvacuum left by the replies. They were not without admonitions and\r\nwarnings, however, and Judith felt the blood mounting to her temples,\r\nand a cold shudder succeeding, as she read one in which the propriety\r\nof the daughter\'s indulging in as much intimacy as had evidently been\r\ndescribed in one of the daughter\'s own letters, with an officer "who\r\ncame from Europe, and who could hardly be supposed to wish to form an\r\nhonorable connection in America," was rather coldly commented on by the\r\nmother. What rendered it singular was the fact that the signatures had\r\nbeen carefully cut from every one of these letters, and wherever a name\r\noccurred in the body of the epistles it had been erased with so much\r\ndiligence as to render it impossible to read it. They had all been\r\nenclosed in envelopes, according to the fashion of the age, and not an\r\naddress either was to be found. Still the letters themselves had been\r\nreligiously preserved, and Judith thought she could discover traces of\r\ntears remaining on several. She now remembered to have seen the little\r\ntrunk in her mother\'s keeping, previously to her death, and she supposed\r\nit had first been deposited in the chest, along with the other forgotten\r\nor concealed objects, when the letters could no longer contribute to\r\nthat parent\'s grief or happiness.\r\n\r\nNext came another bundle, and these were filled with the protestations\r\nof love, written with passion certainly, but also with that deceit which\r\nmen so often think it justifiable to use to the other sex. Judith\r\nhad shed tears abundantly over the first packet, but now she felt a\r\nsentiment of indignation and pride better sustaining her. Her hand\r\nshook, however, and cold shivers again passed through her frame, as she\r\ndiscovered a few points of strong resemblance between these letters and\r\nsome it had been her own fate to receive. Once, indeed, she laid the\r\npacket down, bowed her head to her knees, and seemed nearly convulsed.\r\nAll this time Deerslayer sat a silent but attentive observer of every\r\nthing that passed. As Judith read a letter she put it into his hands to\r\nhold until she could peruse the next; but this served in no degree to\r\nenlighten her companion, as he was totally unable to read. Nevertheless\r\nhe was not entirely at fault in discovering the passions that were\r\ncontending in the bosom of the fair creature by his side, and, as\r\noccasional sentences escaped her in murmurs, he was nearer the truth, in\r\nhis divinations, or conjectures, than the girl would have been pleased\r\nat discovering.\r\n\r\nJudith had commenced with the earliest letters, luckily for a ready\r\ncomprehension of the tale they told, for they were carefully arranged in\r\nchronological order, and to any one who would take the trouble to peruse\r\nthem, would have revealed a sad history of gratified passion, coldness,\r\nand finally of aversion. As she obtained the clue to their import, her\r\nimpatience would not admit of delay, and she soon got to glancing her\r\neyes over a page by way of coming at the truth in the briefest manner\r\npossible. By adopting this expedient, one to which all who are eager to\r\narrive at results without encumbering themselves with details are so apt\r\nto resort, Judith made a rapid progress in these melancholy revelations\r\nof her mother\'s failing and punishment. She saw that the period of her\r\nown birth was distinctly referred to, and even learned that the homely\r\nname she bore was given her by the father, of whose person she retained\r\nso faint an impression as to resemble a dream. This name was not\r\nobliterated from the text of the letters, but stood as if nothing was to\r\nbe gained by erasing it. Hetty\'s birth was mentioned once, and in that\r\ninstance the name was the mother\'s, but ere this period was reached came\r\nthe signs of coldness, shadowing forth the desertion that was so soon to\r\nfollow. It was in this stage of the correspondence that her mother had\r\nrecourse to the plan of copying her own epistles. They were but few, but\r\nwere eloquent with the feelings of blighted affection, and contrition.\r\nJudith sobbed over them, until again and again she felt compelled to\r\nlay them aside from sheer physical inability to see; her eyes being\r\nliterally obscured with tears. Still she returned to the task, with\r\nincreasing interest, and finally succeeded in reaching the end of the\r\nlatest communication that had probably ever passed between her parents.\r\n\r\nAll this occupied fully an hour, for near a hundred letters were glanced\r\nat, and some twenty had been closely read. The truth now shone clear\r\nupon the acute mind of Judith, so far as her own birth and that of Hetty\r\nwere concerned. She sickened at the conviction, and for the moment\r\nthe rest of the world seemed to be cut off from her, and she had now\r\nadditional reasons for wishing to pass the remainder of her life on the\r\nlake, where she had already seen so many bright and so many sorrowing\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThere yet remained more letters to examine. Judith found these were a\r\ncorrespondence between her mother and Thomas Hovey. The originals of\r\nboth parties were carefully arranged, letter and answer, side by\r\nside; and they told the early history of the connection between the\r\nill-assorted pair far more plainly than Judith wished to learn it. Her\r\nmother made the advances towards a marriage, to the surprise, not to\r\nsay horror of her daughter, and she actually found a relief when\r\nshe discovered traces of what struck her as insanity--or a morbid\r\ndesperation, bordering on that dire calamity--in the earlier letters of\r\nthat ill-fated woman. The answers of Hovey were coarse and illiterate,\r\nthough they manifested a sufficient desire to obtain the hand of a woman\r\nof singular personal attractions, and whose great error he was willing\r\nto overlook for the advantage of possessing one every way so much his\r\nsuperior, and who it also appeared was not altogether destitute of\r\nmoney. The remainder of this part of the correspondence was brief, and\r\nit was soon confined to a few communications on business, in which\r\nthe miserable wife hastened the absent husband in his preparations to\r\nabandon a world which there was a sufficient reason to think was as\r\ndangerous to one of the parties as it was disagreeable to the other. But\r\na sincere expression had escaped her mother, by which Judith could get a\r\nclue to the motives that had induced her to marry Hovey, or Hutter, and\r\nthis she found was that feeling of resentment which so often tempts the\r\ninjured to inflict wrongs on themselves by way of heaping coals on the\r\nheads of those through whom they have suffered. Judith had enough of the\r\nspirit of that mother to comprehend this sentiment, and for a moment did\r\nshe see the exceeding folly which permitted such revengeful feelings to\r\nget the ascendancy.\r\n\r\nThere what may be called the historical part of the papers ceased. Among\r\nthe loose fragments, however, was an old newspaper that contained\r\na proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension of certain\r\nfree-booters by name, among which was that of Thomas Hovey. The\r\nattention of the girl was drawn to the proclamation and to this\r\nparticular name by the circumstance that black lines had been drawn\r\nunder both, in ink. Nothing else was found among the papers that could\r\nlead to a discovery of either the name or the place of residence of the\r\nwife of Hutter. All the dates, signatures, and addresses had been\r\ncut from the letters, and wherever a word occurred in the body of the\r\ncommunications that might furnish a clue, it was scrupulously erased.\r\nThus Judith found all her hopes of ascertaining who her parents were\r\ndefeated, and she was obliged to fall back on her own resources and\r\nhabits for everything connected with the future. Her recollection of her\r\nmother\'s manners, conversation, and sufferings filled up many a gap\r\nin the historical facts she had now discovered, and the truth, in\r\nits outlines, stood sufficiently distinct before her to take away all\r\ndesire, indeed, to possess any more details. Throwing herself back in\r\nher seat, she simply desired her companion to finish the examination of\r\nthe other articles in the chest, as it might yet contain something of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it, Judith; I\'ll do it," returned the patient Deerslayer, "but\r\nif there\'s many more letters to read, we shall see the sun ag\'in afore\r\nyou\'ve got through with the reading of them! Two good hours have you\r\nbeen looking at them bits of papers!"\r\n\r\n"They tell me of my parents, Deerslayer, and have settled my plans for\r\nlife. A girl may be excused, who reads about her own father and mother,\r\nand that too for the first time in her life! I am sorry to have kept you\r\nwaiting."\r\n\r\n"Never mind me, gal; never mind me. It matters little whether I sleep\r\nor watch; but though you be pleasant to look at, and are so handsome,\r\nJudith, it is not altogether agreeable to sit so long to behold you\r\nshedding tears. I know that tears don\'t kill, and that some people are\r\nbetter for shedding a few now and then, especially young women; but I\'d\r\nrather see you smile any time, Judith, than see you weep."\r\n\r\nThis gallant speech was rewarded with a sweet, though a melancholy\r\nsmile; and then the girl again desired her companion to finish the\r\nexamination of the chest. The search necessarily continued some time,\r\nduring which Judith collected her thoughts and regained her composure.\r\nShe took no part in the search, leaving everything to the young\r\nman, looking listlessly herself at the different articles that came\r\nuppermost. Nothing further of much interest or value, however, was\r\nfound. A sword or two, such as were then worn by gentlemen, some buckles\r\nof silver, or so richly plated as to appear silver, and a few handsome\r\narticles of female dress, composed the principal discoveries. It struck\r\nboth Judith and the Deerslayer, notwithstanding, that some of these\r\nthings might be made useful in effecting a negotiation with the\r\nIroquois, though the latter saw a difficulty in the way that was not so\r\napparent to the former. The conversation was first renewed in connection\r\nwith this point.\r\n\r\n"And now, Deerslayer," said Judith, "we may talk of yourself, and of the\r\nmeans of getting you out of the hands of the Hurons. Any part, or all\r\nof what you have seen in the chest, will be cheerfully given by me and\r\nHetty to set you at liberty."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s gin\'rous,--yes, \'tis downright free-hearted, and\r\nfree-handed, and gin\'rous. This is the way with women; when they take up\r\na fri\'ndship, they do nothing by halves, but are as willing to part with\r\ntheir property as if it had no value in their eyes. However, while I\r\nthank you both, just as much as if the bargain was made, and Rivenoak,\r\nor any of the other vagabonds, was here to accept and close the treaty,\r\nthere\'s two principal reasons why it can never come to pass, which may\r\nbe as well told at once, in order no onlikely expectations may be raised\r\nin you, or any onjustifiable hopes in me."\r\n\r\n"What reason can there be, if Hetty and I are willing to part with the\r\ntrifles for your sake, and the savages are willing to receive them?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, Judith; you\'ve got the idees, but they\'re a little out of\r\ntheir places, as if a hound should take the back\'ard instead of the\r\nleading scent. That the Mingos will be willing to receive them things,\r\nor any more like \'em you may have to offer is probable enough, but\r\nwhether they\'ll pay valie for \'em is quite another matter. Ask yourself,\r\nJudith, if any one should send you a message to say that, for such or\r\nsuch a price, you and Hetty might have that chist and all it holds,\r\nwhether you\'d think it worth your while to waste many words on the\r\nbargain?"\r\n\r\n"But this chest and all it holds, are already ours; there is no reason\r\nwhy we should purchase what is already our own."\r\n\r\n"Just so the Mingos caculate! They say the chist is theirn, already; or,\r\nas good as theirn, and they\'ll not thank anybody for the key."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Deerslayer; surely we are yet in possession of the\r\nlake, and we can keep possession of it until Hurry sends troops to drive\r\noff the enemy. This we may certainly do provided you will stay with us,\r\ninstead of going back and giving yourself up a prisoner, again, as you\r\nnow seem determined on."\r\n\r\n"That Hurry Harry should talk in this-a-way, is nat\'ral, and according to\r\nthe gifts of the man. He knows no better, and, therefore, he is little\r\nlikely to feel or to act any better; but, Judith, I put it to your heart\r\nand conscience--would you, could you think of me as favorably, as I hope\r\nand believe you now do, was I to forget my furlough and not go back to\r\nthe camp?"\r\n\r\n"To think more favorably of you than I now do, Deerslayer, would not\r\nbe easy; but I might continue to think as favorably--at least it seems\r\nso--I hope I could, for a world wouldn\'t tempt me to let you do anything\r\nthat might change my real opinion of you."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t try to entice me to overlook my furlough, gal! A furlough\r\nis a sacred thing among warriors and men that carry their lives in their\r\nhands, as we of the forests do, and what a grievous disapp\'intment would\r\nit be to old Tamenund, and to Uncas, the father of the Sarpent, and to\r\nmy other fri\'nds in the tribe, if I was so to disgrace myself on my very\r\nfirst war-path. This you will pairceive, moreover, Judith, is without\r\nlaying any stress on nat\'ral gifts, and a white man\'s duties, to say\r\nnothing of conscience. The last is king with me, and I try never to\r\ndispute his orders."\r\n\r\n"I believe you are right, Deerslayer," returned the girl, after a little\r\nreflection and in a saddened voice: "a man like you ought not to act\r\nas the selfish and dishonest would be apt to act; you must, indeed,\r\ngo back. We will talk no more of this, then. Should I persuade you to\r\nanything for which you would be sorry hereafter, my own regret would not\r\nbe less than yours. You shall not have it to say, Judith--I scarce know\r\nby what name to call myself, now!"\r\n\r\n"And why not? Why not, gal? Children take the names of their parents,\r\nnat\'rally, and by a sort of gift, like, and why shouldn\'t you and Hetty\r\ndo as others have done afore ye? Hutter was the old man\'s name, and\r\nHutter should be the name of his darters;--at least until you are given\r\naway in lawful and holy wedlock."\r\n\r\n"I am Judith, and Judith only," returned the girl positively--"until the\r\nlaw gives me a right to another name. Never will I use that of Thomas\r\nHutter again; nor, with my consent, shall Hetty! Hutter was not even his\r\nown name, I find, but had he a thousand rights to it, it would give none\r\nto me. He was not my father, thank heaven; though I may have no reason\r\nto be proud of him that was!"\r\n\r\n"This is strange!" said Deerslayer, looking steadily at the excited\r\ngirl, anxious to know more, but unwilling to inquire into matters that\r\ndid not properly concern him; "yes, this is very strange and oncommon!\r\nThomas Hutter wasn\'t Thomas Hutter, and his darters weren\'t his darters!\r\nWho, then, could Thomas Hutter be, and who are his darters?"\r\n\r\n"Did you never hear anything whispered against the former life of this\r\nperson, Deerslayer?" demanded Judith "Passing, as I did, for his child,\r\nsuch reports reached even me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not deny it, Judith; no, I\'ll not deny it. Sartain things have\r\nbeen said, as I\'ve told you, but I\'m not very credible as to reports.\r\nYoung as I am, I\'ve lived long enough to l\'arn there\'s two sorts of\r\ncharacters in the world--them that is \'arned by deeds, and them that is\r\n\'arned by tongues, and so I prefar to see and judge for myself, instead\r\nof letting every jaw that chooses to wag become my judgment. Hurry Harry\r\nspoke pretty plainly of the whole family, as we journeyed this-a-way,\r\nand he did hint something consarning Thomas Hutter\'s having been a\r\nfree-liver on the water, in his younger days. By free-liver, I mean that\r\nhe made free to live on other men\'s goods."\r\n\r\n"He told you he was a pirate--there is no need of mincing matters\r\nbetween friends. Read that, Deerslayer, and you will see that he told\r\nyou no more than the truth. This Thomas Hovey was the Thomas Hutter you\r\nknew, as is seen by these letters."\r\n\r\nAs Judith spoke, with a flushed cheek and eyes dazzling with the\r\nbrilliancy of excitement, she held the newspaper towards her companion,\r\npointing to the proclamation of a Colonial Governor, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n"Bless you, Judith!" answered the other laughing, "you might as well ask\r\nme to print that--or, for that matter to write it. My edication has been\r\naltogether in the woods; the only book I read, or care about reading,\r\nis the one which God has opened afore all his creatur\'s in the noble\r\nforests, broad lakes, rolling rivers, blue skies, and the winds and\r\ntempests, and sunshine, and other glorious marvels of the land! This\r\nbook I can read, and I find it full of wisdom and knowledge."\r\n\r\n"I crave your pardon, Deerslayer," said Judith, earnestly, more abashed\r\nthan was her wont, in finding that she had in advertently made an appeal\r\nthat might wound her compan ion\'s pride. "I had forgotten your manner of\r\nlife, and least of all did I wish to hurt your feelings."\r\n\r\n"Hurt my feelin\'s? Why should it hurt my feelin\'s to ask me to read,\r\nwhen I can\'t read. I\'m a hunter--and I may now begin to say a warrior,\r\nand no missionary, and therefore books and papers are of no account with\r\nsuch as I--No, no--Judith," and here the young man laughed cordially,\r\n"not even for wads, seeing that your true deerkiller always uses the\r\nhide of a fa\'a\'n, if he\'s got one, or some other bit of leather suitably\r\nprepared. There\'s some that do say, all that stands in print is true,\r\nin which case I\'ll own an unl\'arned man must be somewhat of a loser;\r\nnevertheless, it can\'t be truer than that which God has printed with his\r\nown hand in the sky, and the woods, and the rivers, and the springs."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Hutter, or Hovey, was a pirate, and being no father of\r\nmine, I cannot wish to call him one. His name shall no longer be my\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"If you dislike the name of that man, there\'s the name of your mother,\r\nJudith. Her\'n may sarve you just as good a turn."\r\n\r\n"I do not know it. I\'ve look\'d through those papers, Deerslayer, in the\r\nhope of finding some hint by which I might discover who my mother was,\r\nbut there is no more trace of the past, in that respect, than the bird\r\nleaves in the air."\r\n\r\n"That\'s both oncommon, and onreasonable. Parents are bound to give their\r\noffspring a name, even though they give \'em nothing else. Now I come of\r\na humble stock, though we have white gifts and a white natur\', but we\r\nare not so poorly off as to have no name. Bumppo we are called, and I\'ve\r\nheard it said--" a touch of human vanity glowing on his cheek, "that the\r\ntime has been when the Bumppos had more standing and note among mankind\r\nthan they have just now."\r\n\r\n"They never deserved them more, Deerslayer, and the name is a good one;\r\neither Hetty, or myself, would a thousand times rather be called Hetty\r\nBumppo, or Judith Bumppo, than to be called Hetty or Judith Hutter."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a moral impossible," returned the hunter, good humouredly,\r\n"onless one of you should so far demean herself as to marry me."\r\n\r\nJudith could not refrain from smiling, when she found how simply and\r\nnaturally the conversation had come round to the very point at which she\r\nhad aimed to bring it. Although far from unfeminine or forward, either\r\nin her feelings or her habits, the girl was goaded by a sense of wrongs\r\nnot altogether merited, incited by the hopelessness of a future that\r\nseemed to contain no resting place, and still more influenced by\r\nfeelings that were as novel to her as they proved to be active and\r\nengrossing. The opening was too good, therefore, to be neglected,\r\nthough she came to the subject with much of the indirectness and perhaps\r\njustifiable address of a woman.\r\n\r\n"I do not think Hetty will ever marry, Deerslayer," she said, "and if\r\nyour name is to be borne by either of us, it must be borne by me."\r\n\r\n"There\'s been handsome women too, they tell me, among the Bumppos,\r\nJudith, afore now, and should you take up with the name, oncommon as you\r\nbe in this particular, them that knows the family won\'t be altogether\r\nsurprised."\r\n\r\n"This is not talking as becomes either of us, Deerslayer, for whatever\r\nis said on such a subject, between man and woman, should be said\r\nseriously and in sincerity of heart. Forgetting the shame that ought to\r\nkeep girls silent until spoken to, in most cases, I will deal with you\r\nas frankly as I know one of your generous nature will most like to be\r\ndealt by. Can you--do you think, Deerslayer, that you could be happy\r\nwith such a wife as a woman like myself would make?"\r\n\r\n"A woman like you, Judith! But where\'s the sense in trifling about such\r\na thing? A woman like you, that is handsome enough to be a captain\'s\r\nlady, and fine enough, and so far as I know edicated enough, would be\r\nlittle apt to think of becoming my wife. I suppose young gals that\r\nfeel themselves to be smart, and know themselves to be handsome, find a\r\nsartain satisfaction in passing their jokes ag\'in them that\'s neither,\r\nlike a poor Delaware hunter."\r\n\r\nThis was said good naturedly, but not without a betrayal of feeling\r\nwhich showed that something like mortified sensibility was blended\r\nwith the reply. Nothing could have occurred more likely to awaken all\r\nJudith\'s generous regrets, or to aid her in her purpose, by adding the\r\nstimulant of a disinterested desire to atone to her other impulses, and\r\ncloaking all under a guise so winning and natural, as greatly to lessen\r\nthe unpleasant feature of a forwardness unbecoming the sex.\r\n\r\n"You do me injustice if you suppose I have any such thought, or wish,"\r\nshe answered, earnestly. "Never was I more serious in my life, or more\r\nwilling to abide by any agreement that we may make to-night. I have had\r\nmany suitors, Deerslayer--nay, scarce an unmarried trapper or hunter\r\nhas been in at the Lake these four years, who has not offered to take me\r\naway with him, and I fear some that were married, too--"\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'ll warrant that!" interrupted the other--"I\'ll warrant all that!\r\nTake \'em as a body, Judith, \'arth don\'t hold a set of men more given to\r\ntheirselves, and less given to God and the law."\r\n\r\n"Not one of them would I--could I listen to; happily for myself perhaps,\r\nhas it been that such was the case. There have been well looking youths\r\namong them too, as you may have seen in your acquaintance, Henry March."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Harry is sightly to the eye, though, to my idees, less so to the\r\njudgment. I thought, at first, you meant to have him, Judith, I did; but\r\nafore he went, it was easy enough to verify that the same lodge wouldn\'t\r\nbe big enough for you both."\r\n\r\n"You have done me justice in that at least, Deerslayer. Hurry is a man I\r\ncould never marry, though he were ten times more comely to the eye, and\r\na hundred times more stout of heart than he really is."\r\n\r\n"Why not, Judith, why not? I own I\'m cur\'ous to know why a youth like\r\nHurry shouldn\'t find favor with a maiden like you?"\r\n\r\n"Then you shall know, Deerslayer," returned the girl, gladly availing\r\nherself of the opportunity of indirectly extolling the qualities which\r\nhad so strongly interested her in her listener; hoping by these means\r\ncovertly to approach the subject nearest her heart. "In the first place,\r\nlooks in a man are of no importance with a woman, provided he is manly,\r\nand not disfigured, or deformed."\r\n\r\n"There I can\'t altogether agree with you," returned the other\r\nthoughtfully, for he had a very humble opinion of his own personal\r\nappearance; "I have noticed that the comeliest warriors commonly get the\r\nbest-looking maidens of the tribe for wives, and the Sarpent, yonder,\r\nwho is sometimes wonderful in his paint, is a gineral favorite with all\r\nthe Delaware young women, though he takes to Hist, himself, as if she\r\nwas the only beauty on \'arth!"\r\n\r\n"It may be so with Indians; but it is different with white girls. So\r\nlong as a young man has a straight and manly frame, that promises to\r\nmake him able to protect a woman, and to keep want from the door, it is\r\nall they ask of the figure. Giants like Hurry may do for grenadiers, but\r\nare of little account as lovers. Then as to the face, an honest look,\r\none that answers for the heart within, is of more value than any shape\r\nor colour, or eyes, or teeth, or trifles like them. The last may do for\r\ngirls, but who thinks of them at all, in a hunter, or a warrior, or a\r\nhusband? If there are women so silly, Judith is not among them."\r\n\r\n"Well, this is wonderful! I always thought that handsome liked handsome,\r\nas riches love riches!"\r\n\r\n"It may be so with you men, Deerslayer, but it is not always so with us\r\nwomen. We like stout-hearted men, but we wish to see them modest; sure\r\non a hunt, or the war-path, ready to die for the right, and unwilling to\r\nyield to the wrong. Above all we wish for honesty--tongues that are not\r\nused to say what the mind does not mean, and hearts that feel a little\r\nfor others, as well as for themselves. A true-hearted girl could die for\r\nsuch a husband! while the boaster, and the double-tongued suitor gets to\r\nbe as hateful to the sight, as he is to the mind."\r\n\r\nJudith spoke bitterly, and with her usual force, but her listener was\r\ntoo much struck with the novelty of the sensations he experienced to\r\nadvert to her manner. There was something so soothing to the humility of\r\na man of his temperament, to hear qualities that he could not but know\r\nhe possessed himself, thus highly extolled by the loveliest female he\r\nhad ever beheld, that, for the moment, his faculties seemed suspended\r\nin a natural and excusable pride. Then it was that the idea of the\r\npossibility of such a creature as Judith becoming his companion for life\r\nfirst crossed his mind. The image was so pleasant, and so novel, that\r\nhe continued completely absorbed by it for more than a minute, totally\r\nregardless of the beautiful reality that was seated before him, watching\r\nthe expression of his upright and truth-telling countenance with a\r\nkeenness that gave her a very fair, if not an absolutely accurate clue\r\nto his thoughts. Never before had so pleasing a vision floated before\r\nthe mind\'s eye of the young hunter, but, accustomed most to practical\r\nthings, and little addicted to submitting to the power of his\r\nimagination, even while possessed of so much true poetical feeling in\r\nconnection with natural objects in particular, he soon recovered his\r\nreason, and smiled at his own weakness, as the fancied picture faded\r\nfrom his mental sight, and left him the simple, untaught, but highly\r\nmoral being he was, seated in the Ark of Thomas Hutter, at midnight,\r\nwith the lovely countenance of its late owner\'s reputed daughter,\r\nbeaming on him with anxious scrutiny, by the light of the solitary lamp.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wonderful handsome, and enticing, and pleasing to look on,\r\nJudith!" he exclaimed, in his simplicity, as fact resumed its ascendency\r\nover fancy. "Wonderful! I don\'t remember ever to have seen so beautiful\r\na gal, even among the Delawares; and I\'m not astonished that Hurry Harry\r\nwent away soured as well as disapp\'inted!"\r\n\r\n"Would you have had me, Deerslayer, become the wife of such a man as\r\nHenry March?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s that which is in his favor, and there\'s that which is ag\'in\r\nhim. To my taste, Hurry wouldn\'t make the best of husbands, but I fear\r\nthat the tastes of most young women, hereaway, wouldn\'t be so hard upon\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No--no--Judith without a name would never consent to be called Judith\r\nMarch! Anything would be better than that."\r\n\r\n"Judith Bumppo wouldn\'t sound as well, gal; and there\'s many names that\r\nwould fall short of March, in pleasing the ear."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Deerslayer, the pleasantness of the sound, in such cases, doesn\'t\r\ncome through the ear, but through the heart. Everything is agreeable,\r\nwhen the heart is satisfied. Were Natty Bumppo, Henry March, and Henry\r\nMarch, Natty Bumppo, I might think the name of March better than it is;\r\nor were he, you, I should fancy the name of Bumppo horrible!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it--yes, that\'s the reason of the matter. Now, I\'m\r\nnat\'rally avarse to sarpents, and I hate even the word, which, the\r\nmissionaries tell me, comes from human natur\', on account of a sartain\r\nsarpent at the creation of the \'arth, that outwitted the first woman;\r\nyet, ever since Chingachgook has \'arned the title he bears, why the\r\nsound is as pleasant to my ears as the whistle of the whippoorwill of a\r\ncalm evening--it is. The feelin\'s make all the difference in the world,\r\nJudith, in the natur\' of sounds; ay, even in that of looks, too."\r\n\r\n"This is so true, Deerslayer, that I am surprised you should think it\r\nremarkable a girl, who may have some comeliness herself, should not\r\nthink it necessary that her husband should have the same advantage, or\r\nwhat you fancy an advantage. To me, looks in a man is nothing provided\r\nhis countenance be as honest as his heart."\r\n\r\n"Yes, honesty is a great advantage, in the long run; and they that are\r\nthe most apt to forget it in the beginning, are the most apt to l\'arn\r\nit in the ind. Nevertheless, there\'s more, Judith, that look to present\r\nprofit than to the benefit that is to come after a time. One they think\r\na sartainty, and the other an onsartainty. I\'m glad, howsever, that you\r\nlook at the thing in its true light, and not in the way in which so many\r\nis apt to deceive themselves."\r\n\r\n"I do thus look at it, Deerslayer," returned the girl with emphasis,\r\nstill shrinking with a woman\'s sensitiveness from a direct offer of her\r\nhand, "and can say, from the bottom of my heart, that I would rather\r\ntrust my happiness to a man whose truth and feelings may be depended\r\non, than to a false-tongued and false-hearted wretch that had chests\r\nof gold, and houses and lands--yes, though he were even seated on a\r\nthrone!"\r\n\r\n"These are brave words, Judith; they\'re downright brave words; but\r\ndo you think that the feelin\'s would keep \'em company, did the ch\'ice\r\nactually lie afore you? If a gay gallant in a scarlet coat stood on one\r\nside, with his head smelling like a deer\'s foot, his face smooth and\r\nblooming as your own, his hands as white and soft as if God hadn\'t\r\nbestowed \'em that man might live by the sweat of his brow, and his step\r\nas lofty as dancing-teachers and a light heart could make it; and the\r\nother side stood one that has passed his days in the open air till his\r\nforehead is as red as his cheek; had cut his way through swamps and\r\nbushes till his hand was as rugged as the oaks he slept under; had\r\ntrodden on the scent of game till his step was as stealthy as the\r\ncatamount\'s, and had no other pleasant odor about him than such as\r\nnatur\' gives in the free air and the forest--now, if both these men\r\nstood here, as suitors for your feelin\'s, which do you think would win\r\nyour favor?"\r\n\r\nJudith\'s fine face flushed, for the picture that her companion had\r\nso simply drawn of a gay officer of the garrisons had once been\r\nparticularly grateful to her imagination, though experience and\r\ndisappointment had not only chilled all her affections, but given them a\r\nbackward current, and the passing image had a momentary influence on her\r\nfeelings; but the mounting colour was succeeded by a paleness so deadly,\r\nas to make her appear ghastly.\r\n\r\n"As God is my judge," the girl solemnly answered, "did both these men\r\nstand before me, as I may say one of them does, my choice, if I know my\r\nown heart, would be the latter. I have no wish for a husband who is any\r\nway better than myself."\r\n\r\n"This is pleasant to listen to, and might lead a young man in time to\r\nforget his own onworthiness, Judith! Howsever, you hardly think all that\r\nyou say. A man like me is too rude and ignorant for one that has had\r\nsuch a mother to teach her. Vanity is nat\'ral, I do believe, but vanity\r\nlike that, would surpass reason."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not know of what a woman\'s heart is capable! Rude you are\r\nnot, Deerslayer, nor can one be called ignorant that has studied what\r\nis before his eyes as closely as you have done. When the affections are\r\nconcerned, all things appear in their pleasantest colors, and trifles\r\nare overlooked, or are forgotten. When the heart feels sunshine, nothing\r\nis gloomy, even dull looking objects, seeming gay and bright, and so it\r\nwould be between you and the woman who should love you, even though your\r\nwife might happen, in some matters, to possess what the world calls the\r\nadvantage over you."\r\n\r\n"Judith, you come of people altogether above mine, in the world, and\r\nonequal matches, like onequal fri\'ndships can\'t often tarminate kindly.\r\nI speak of this matter altogether as a fanciful thing, since it\'s not\r\nvery likely that you, at least, would be apt to treat it as a matter\r\nthat can ever come to pass."\r\n\r\nJudith fastened her deep blue eyes on the open, frank countenance of\r\nher companion, as if she would read his soul. Nothing there betrayed\r\nany covert meaning, and she was obliged to admit to herself, that he\r\nregarded the conversation as argumentative, rather than positive, and\r\nthat he was still without any active suspicion that her feelings were\r\nseriously involved in the issue. At first, she felt offended; then she\r\nsaw the injustice of making the self-abasement and modesty of the hunter\r\na charge against him, and this novel difficulty gave a piquancy to the\r\nstate of affairs that rather increased her interest in the young man. At\r\nthat critical instant, a change of plan flashed on her mind, and with\r\na readiness of invention that is peculiar to the quick-witted and\r\ningenious, she adopted a scheme by which she hoped effectually to bind\r\nhim to her person. This scheme partook equally of her fertility of\r\ninvention, and of the decision and boldness of her character. That the\r\nconversation might not terminate too abruptly, however, or any suspicion\r\nof her design exist, she answered the last remark of Deerslayer, as\r\nearnestly and as truly as if her original intention remained unaltered.\r\n\r\n"I, certainly, have no reason to boast of parentage, after what I have\r\nseen this night," said the girl, in a saddened voice. "I had a mother,\r\nit is true; but of her name even, I am ignorant--and, as for my father,\r\nit is better, perhaps, that I should never know who he was, lest I speak\r\ntoo bitterly of him!"\r\n\r\n"Judith," said Deerslayer, taking her hand kindly, and with a manly\r\nsincerity that went directly to the girl\'s heart, "tis better to say no\r\nmore to-night. Sleep on what you\'ve seen and felt; in the morning\r\nthings that now look gloomy, may look more che\'rful. Above all, never\r\ndo anything in bitterness, or because you feel as if you\'d like to take\r\nrevenge on yourself for other people\'s backslidings. All that has been\r\nsaid or done atween us, this night, is your secret, and shall never be\r\ntalked of by me, even with the Sarpent, and you may be sartain if he\r\ncan\'t get it out of me no man can. If your parents have been faulty, let\r\nthe darter be less so; remember that you\'re young, and the youthful may\r\nalways hope for better times; that you\'re more quick-witted than usual,\r\nand such gin\'rally get the better of difficulties, and that, as for\r\nbeauty, you\'re oncommon, which is an advantage with all. It is time to\r\nget a little rest, for to-morrow is like to prove a trying day to some\r\nof us."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer arose as he spoke, and Judith had no choice but to comply.\r\nThe chest was closed and secured, and they parted in silence, she to\r\ntake her place by the side of Hist and Hetty, and he to seek a blanket\r\non the floor of the cabin he was in. It was not five minutes ere the\r\nyoung man was in a deep sleep, but the girl continued awake for a long\r\ntime. She scarce knew whether to lament, or to rejoice, at having\r\nfailed in making herself understood. On the one hand were her womanly\r\nsensibilities spared; on the other was the disappointment of defeated,\r\nor at least of delayed expectations, and the uncertainty of a future\r\nthat looked so dark. Then came the new resolution, and the bold project\r\nfor the morrow, and when drowsiness finally shut her eyes, they closed\r\non a scene of success and happiness, that was pictured by the fancy,\r\nunder the influence of a sanguine temperament, and a happy invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n    "But, mother, now a shade has past,\r\n    Athwart my brightest visions here,\r\n    A cloud of darkest gloom has wrapt,\r\n    The remnant of my brief career!\r\n    No song, no echo can I win,\r\n    The sparkling fount has died within."\r\n\r\n    Margaret Davidson, "To my Mother," 11.  7-12.\r\n\r\nHist and Hetty arose with the return of light, leaving Judith still\r\nburied in sleep. It took but a minute for the first to complete her\r\ntoilet. Her long coal-black hair was soon adjusted in a simple knot,\r\nthe calico dress belted tight to her slender waist, and her little feet\r\nconcealed in their gaudily ornamented moccasins. When attired, she left\r\nher companion employed in household affairs, and went herself on\r\nthe platform to breathe the pure air of the morning. Here she found\r\nChingachgook studying the shores of the lake, the mountains and the\r\nheavens, with the sagacity of a man of the woods, and the gravity of an\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between the two lovers was simple, but affectionate. The\r\nchief showed a manly kindness, equally removed from boyish weakness and\r\nhaste, while the girl betrayed, in her smile and half averted looks, the\r\nbashful tenderness of her sex. Neither spoke, unless it were with the\r\neyes, though each understood the other as fully as if a vocabulary of\r\nwords and protestations had been poured out. Hist seldom appeared\r\nto more advantage than at that moment, for just from her rest and\r\nablutions, there was a freshness about her youthful form and face that\r\nthe toils of the wood do not always permit to be exhibited, by even the\r\njuvenile and pretty. Then Judith had not only imparted some of her\r\nown skill in the toilet, during their short intercourse, but she had\r\nactually bestowed a few well selected ornaments from her own stores,\r\nthat contributed not a little to set off the natural graces of the\r\nIndian maid. All this the lover saw and felt, and for a moment his\r\ncountenance was illuminated with a look of pleasure, but it soon grew\r\ngrave again, and became saddened and anxious. The stools used the\r\nprevious night were still standing on the platform; placing two against\r\nthe walls of the hut, he seated himself on one, making a gesture to\r\nhis companion to take the other. This done, he continued thoughtful and\r\nsilent for quite a minute, maintaining the reflecting dignity of one\r\nborn to take his seat at the council-fire, while Hist was furtively\r\nwatching the expression of his face, patient and submissive, as became\r\na woman of her people. Then the young warrior stretched his arm before\r\nhim, as if to point out the glories of the scene at that witching\r\nhour, when the whole panorama, as usual, was adorned by the mellow\r\ndistinctness of early morning, sweeping with his hand slowly over lake,\r\nhills and heavens. The girl followed the movement with pleased wonder,\r\nsmiling as each new beauty met her gaze.\r\n\r\n"Hugh!" exclaimed the chief, in admiration of a scene so unusual even\r\nto him, for this was the first lake he had ever beheld. "This is the\r\ncountry of the Manitou! It is too good for Mingos, Hist; but the curs of\r\nthat tribe are howling in packs through the woods. They think that the\r\nDelawares are asleep, over the mountains."\r\n\r\n"All but one of them is, Chingachgook. There is one here; and he is of\r\nthe blood of Uncas!"\r\n\r\n"What is one warrior against a tribe? The path to our villages is\r\nvery long and crooked, and we shall travel it under a cloudy sky. I am\r\nafraid, too, Honeysuckle of the Hills, that we shall travel it alone!"\r\n\r\nHist understood the allusion, and it made her sad; though it sounded\r\nsweet to her ears to be compared, by the warrior she so loved, to the\r\nmost fragrant and the pleasantest of all the wild flowers of her native\r\nwoods. Still she continued silent, as became her when the allusion was\r\nto a grave interest that men could best control, though it exceeded the\r\npower of education to conceal the smile that gratified feeling brought\r\nto her pretty mouth.\r\n\r\n"When the sun is thus," continued the Delaware, pointing to the zenith,\r\nby simply casting upward a hand and finger, by a play of the wrist, "the\r\ngreat hunter of our tribe will go back to the Hurons to be treated like\r\na bear, that they roast and skin even on full stomachs."\r\n\r\n"The Great Spirit may soften their hearts, and not suffer them to be so\r\nbloody minded. I have lived among the Hurons, and know them. They have\r\nhearts, and will not forget their own children, should they fall into\r\nthe hands of the Delawares."\r\n\r\n"A wolf is forever howling; a hog will always eat. They have lost\r\nwarriors; even their women will call out for vengeance. The pale-face\r\nhas the eyes of an eagle, and can see into a Mingo\'s heart; he looks for\r\nno mercy. There is a cloud over his spirit, though it is not before his\r\nface."\r\n\r\nA long, thoughtful pause succeeded, during which Hist stealthily took\r\nthe hand of the chief, as if seeking his support, though she scarce\r\nventured to raise her eyes to a countenance that was now literally\r\nbecoming terrible, under the conflicting passions and stern resolution\r\nthat were struggling in the breast of its owner.\r\n\r\n"What will the Son of Uncas do?" the girl at length timidly asked. "He\r\nis a chief, and is already celebrated in council, though so young; what\r\ndoes his heart tell him is wisest; does the head, too, speak the same\r\nwords as the heart?"\r\n\r\n"What does Wah-ta-Wah say, at a moment when my dearest friend is in such\r\ndanger. The smallest birds sing the sweetest; it is always pleasant to\r\nhearken to their songs. I wish I could hear the Wren of the Woods in my\r\ndifficulty; its note would reach deeper than the ear."\r\n\r\nAgain Hist experienced the profound gratification that the language of\r\npraise can always awaken when uttered by those we love. The \'Honeysuckle\r\nof the Hills\' was a term often applied to the girl by the young men of\r\nthe Delawares, though it never sounded so sweet in her ears as from the\r\nlips of Chingachgook; but the latter alone had ever styled her the Wren\r\nof the Woods. With him, however, it had got to be a familiar phrase, and\r\nit was past expression pleasant to the listener, since it conveyed to\r\nher mind the idea that her advice and sentiments were as acceptable to\r\nher future husband, as the tones of her voice and modes of conveying\r\nthem were agreeable; uniting the two things most prized by an Indian\r\ngirl, as coming from her betrothed, admiration for a valued physical\r\nadvantage, with respect for her opinion. She pressed the hand she held\r\nbetween both her own, and answered--\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah says that neither she nor the Great Serpent could ever\r\nlaugh again, or ever sleep without dreaming of the Hurons, should the\r\nDeerslayer die under a Mingo tomahawk, and they do nothing to save him.\r\nShe would rather go back, and start on her long path alone, than let\r\nsuch a dark cloud pass before her happiness."\r\n\r\n"Good! The husband and the wife will have but one heart; they will see\r\nwith the same eyes, and feel with the same feelings."\r\n\r\nWhat further was said need not be related here. That the conversation\r\nwas of Deerslayer, and his hopes, has been seen already, but the\r\ndecision that was come to will better appear in the course of the\r\nnarrative. The youthful pair were yet conversing when the sun appeared\r\nabove the tops of the pines, and the light of a brilliant American\r\nday streamed down into the valley, bathing "in deep joy" the lake, the\r\nforests and the mountain sides. Just at this instant Deerslayer came out\r\nof the cabin of the Ark and stepped upon the platform. His first look\r\nwas at the cloudless heavens, then his rapid glance took in the entire\r\npanorama of land and water, when he had leisure for a friendly nod at\r\nhis friends, and a cheerful smile for Hist.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, in his usual, composed manner, and pleasant voice, "he\r\nthat sees the sun set in the west, and wakes \'arly enough in the morning\r\nwill be sartain to find him coming back ag\'in in the east, like a buck\r\nthat is hunted round his ha\'nt. I dare say, now, Hist, you\'ve beheld\r\nthis, time and ag\'in, and yet it never entered into your galish mind to\r\nask the reason?"\r\n\r\nBoth Chingachgook and his betrothed looked up at the luminary, with an\r\nair that betokened sudden wonder, and then they gazed at each other,\r\nas if to seek the solution of the difficulty. Familiarity deadens the\r\nsensibilities even as connected with the gravest natural phenomena,\r\nand never before had these simple beings thought of enquiring into a\r\nmovement that was of daily occurrence, however puzzling it might appear\r\non investigation. When the subject was thus suddenly started, it struck\r\nboth alike, and at the same instant, with some such force, as any new\r\nand brilliant proposition in the natural sciences would strike the\r\nscholar. Chingachgook alone saw fit to answer.\r\n\r\n"The pale-faces know everything," he said; "can they tell us why the sun\r\nhides his face, when he goes back, at night."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that is downright red-skin l\'arnin\'" returned the other, laughing,\r\nthough he was not altogether insensible to the pleasure of proving the\r\nsuperiority of his race by solving the difficulty, which he set about\r\ndoing in his own peculiar manner. "Harkee, Sarpent," he continued more\r\ngravely, though too simply for affectation; "this is easierly explained\r\nthan an Indian brain may fancy. The sun, while he seems to keep\r\ntraveling in the heavens, never budges, but it is the \'arth that turns\r\nround, and any one can understand, if he is placed on the side of a\r\nmill-wheel, for instance, when it\'s in motion, that he must some times\r\nsee the heavens, while he is at other times under water. There\'s no\r\ngreat secret in that; but plain natur\'; the difficulty being in setting\r\nthe \'arth in motion."\r\n\r\n"How does my brother know that the earth turns round?" demanded the\r\nIndian. "Can he see it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s been a puzzler, I will own, Delaware, for I\'ve often\r\ntried, but never could fairly make it out. Sometimes I\'ve consaited that\r\nI could; and then ag\'in, I\'ve been obliged to own it an onpossibility.\r\nHowsever, turn it does, as all my people say, and you ought to believe\r\n\'em, since they can foretell eclipses, and other prodigies, that used\r\nto fill the tribes with terror, according to your own traditions of such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Good. This is true; no red man will deny it. When a wheel turns, my\r\neyes can see it--they do not see the earth turn."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s what I call sense obstinacy! Seeing is believing, they say,\r\nand what they can\'t see, some men won\'t in the least give credit to.\r\nNeverthless, chief, that isn\'t quite as good reason as it mayat first\r\nseem. You believe in the Great Spirit, I know, and yet, I conclude, it\r\nwould puzzle you to show where you see him!"\r\n\r\n"Chingachgook can see Him everywhere--everywhere in good things--the Evil\r\nSpirit in bad. Here, in the lake; there, in the forest; yonder, in the\r\nclouds; in Hist, in the Son of Uncas, in Tannemund, in Deerslayer. The\r\nEvil Spirit is in the Mingos. That I see; I do not see the earth turn\r\nround."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder they call you the Sarpent, Delaware; no, I don\'t!\r\nThere\'s always a meaning in your words, and there\'s often a meaning in\r\nyour countenance, too! Notwithstanding, your answers doesn\'t quite meet\r\nmy idee. That God is observable in all nat\'ral objects is allowable, but\r\nthen he is not perceptible in the way I mean. You know there is a Great\r\nSpirit by his works, and the pale-faces know that the \'arth turns round\r\nby its works. This is the reason of the matter, though how it is to\r\nbe explained is more than I can exactly tell you. This I know; all my\r\npeople consait that fact, and what all the pale-faces consait, is very\r\nlikely to be true."\r\n\r\n"When the sun is in the top of that pine to-morrow, where will my\r\nbrother Deerslayer be?"\r\n\r\nThe hunter started, and he looked intently, though totally without\r\nalarm, at his friend. Then he signed for him to follow, and led the way\r\ninto the Ark, where he might pursue the subject unheard by those whose\r\nfeelings he feared might get the mastery over their reason. Here he\r\nstopped, and pursued the conversation in a more confidential tone.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas a little onreasonable in you Sarpent," he said, "to bring up such\r\na subject afore Hist, and when the young women of my own colour might\r\noverhear what was said. Yes, \'twas a little more onreasonable than most\r\nthings that you do. No matter; Hist didn\'t comprehend, and the other\r\ndidn\'t hear. Howsever, the question is easier put than answered. No\r\nmortal can say where he will be when the sun rises to-morrow. I will ask\r\nyou the same question, Sarpent, and should like to hear what answer you\r\ncan give."\r\n\r\n"Chingachgook will be with his friend Deerslayer--if he be in the land\r\nof spirits, the Great Serpent will crawl at his side; if beneath yonder\r\nsun, its warmth and light shall fall on both."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Delaware," returned the other, touched with the\r\nsimple self-devotion of his friend, "Such language is as plain in one\r\ntongue as in another. It comes from the heart, and goes to the heart,\r\ntoo. \'Tis well to think so, and it may be well to say so, for that\r\nmatter, but it would not be well to do so, Sarpent. You are no longer\r\nalone in life, for though you have the lodges to change, and other\r\nceremonies to go through, afore Hist becomes your lawful wife, yet are\r\nyou as good as married in all that bears on the feelin\'s, and joy, and\r\nmisery. No--no--Hist must not be desarted, because a cloud is passing\r\natween you and me, a little onexpectedly and a little darker than we may\r\nhave looked for."\r\n\r\n"Hist is a daughter of the Mohicans. She knows how to obey her husband.\r\nWhere he goes, she will follow. Both will be with the Great Hunter of\r\nthe Delawares, when the sun shall be in the pine to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"The Lord bless and protect you! Chief, this is downright madness. Can\r\neither, or both of you, alter a Mingo natur\'? Will your grand looks,\r\nor Hist\'s tears and beauty, change a wolf into a squirrel, or make a\r\ncatamount as innocent as a fa\'an? No--Sarpent, you will think better\r\nof this matter, and leave me in the hands of God. A\'ter all, it\'s by no\r\nmeans sartain that the scamps design the torments, for they may yet be\r\npitiful, and bethink them of the wickedness of such a course--though it\r\nis but a hopeless expectation to look forward to a Mingo\'s turning aside\r\nfrom evil, and letting marcy get uppermost in his heart. Nevertheless,\r\nno one knows to a sartainty what will happen, and young creatur\'s, like\r\nHist, a\'n\'t to be risked on onsartainties. This marrying is altogether\r\na different undertaking from what some young men fancy. Now, if you was\r\nsingle, or as good as single, Delaware, I should expect you to be actyve\r\nand stirring about the camp of the vagabonds, from sunrise to sunset,\r\nsarcumventing and contriving, as restless as a hound off the scent, and\r\ndoing all manner of things to help me, and to distract the inimy, but\r\ntwo are oftener feebler than one, and we must take things as they are,\r\nand not as we want \'em to be."\r\n\r\n"Listen, Deerslayer," returned the Indian with an emphasis so decided as\r\nto show how much he was in earnest. "If Chingachgook was in the hands\r\nof the Hurons, what would my pale-face brother do? Sneak off to the\r\nDelaware villages, and say to the chiefs, and old men, and young\r\nwarriors--\'see, here is Wah-ta-Wah; she is safe, but a little tired;\r\nand here is the Son of Uncas, not as tired as the Honeysuckle, being\r\nstronger, but just as safe.\' Would he do this?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s oncommon ingen\'ous; it\'s cunning enough for a Mingo,\r\nhimself! The Lord only knows what put it into your head to ask such a\r\nquestion. What would I do? Why, in the first place, Hist wouldn\'t be\r\nlikely to be in my company at all, for she would stay as near you as\r\npossible, and therefore all that part about her couldn\'t be said without\r\ntalking nonsense. As for her being tired, that would fall through too,\r\nif she didn\'t go, and no part of your speech would be likely to come\r\nfrom me; so, you see, Sarpent, reason is ag\'in you, and you may as well\r\ngive it up, since to hold out ag\'in reason, is no way becoming a chief\r\nof your character and repitation."\r\n\r\n"My brother is not himself; he forgets that he is talking to one who has\r\nsat at the Council Fire of his nation," returned the other kindly. "When\r\nmen speak, they should say that which does not go in at one side of the\r\nhead and out at the other. Their words shouldn\'t be feathers, so light\r\nthat a wind which does not ruffle the water can blow them away. He\r\nhas not answered my question; when a chief puts a question, his friend\r\nshould not talk of other things."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Delaware; I understand well enough what you mean, and\r\ntruth won\'t allow me to say otherwise. Still it\'s not as easy to answer\r\nas you seem to think, for this plain reason. You wish me to say what\r\nI would do if I had a betrothed as you have, here, on the lake, and a\r\nfri\'nd yonder in the Huron camp, in danger of the torments. That\'s it,\r\nisn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe Indian bowed his head silently, and always with unmoved gravity,\r\nthough his eye twinkled at the sight of the other\'s embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never had a betrothed--never had the kind of feelin\'s toward\r\nany young woman that you have towards Hist, though the Lord knows my\r\nfeelin\'s are kind enough towards \'em all! Still my heart, as they call\r\nit in such matters, isn\'t touched, and therefore I can\'t say what I\r\nwould do. A fri\'nd pulls strong, that I know by exper\'ence, Sarpent,\r\nbut, by all that I\'ve seen and heard consarning love, I\'m led to think\r\nthat a betrothed pulls stronger."\r\n\r\n"True; but the betrothed of Chingachgook does not pull towards the\r\nlodges of the Delawares; she pulls towards the camp of the Hurons."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a noble gal, for all her little feet, and hands that an\'t bigger\r\nthan a child\'s, and a voice that is as pleasant as a mocker\'s; she\'s a\r\nnoble gal, and like the stock of her sires! Well, what is it, Sarpent;\r\nfor I conclude she hasn\'t changed her mind, and means to give herself\r\nup, and turn Huron wife. What is it you want?"\r\n\r\n"Wah-ta-Wah will never live in the wigwam of an Iroquois," answered\r\nthe Delaware drily. "She has little feet, but they can carry her to the\r\nvillages of her people; she has small hands, too, but her mind is large.\r\nMy brother will see what we can do, when the time shall come, rather\r\nthan let him die under Mingo torments."\r\n\r\n"Attempt nothing heedlessly, Delaware," said the other earnestly; "I\r\nsuppose you must and will have your way; and, on the whole it\'s right\r\nyou should, for you\'d neither be happy, unless something was undertaken.\r\nBut attempt nothing heedlessly--I didn\'t expect you\'d quit the lake,\r\nwhile my matter remained in unsartainty, but remember, Sarpent, that no\r\ntorments that Mingo ingenuity can invent, no ta\'ntings and revilings;\r\nno burnings and roastings and nail-tearings, nor any other onhuman\r\ncontrivances can so soon break down my spirit, as to find that you and\r\nHist have fallen into the power of the inimy in striving to do something\r\nfor my good."\r\n\r\n"The Delawares are prudent. The Deerslayer will not find them running\r\ninto a strange camp with their eyes shut."\r\n\r\nHere the dialogue terminated. Hetty announced that the breakfast was\r\nready, and the whole party was soon seated around the simple board, in\r\nthe usual primitive manner of borderers. Judith was the last to take her\r\nseat, pale, silent, and betraying in her countenance that she had passed\r\na painful, if not a sleepless, night. At this meal scarce a syllable was\r\nexchanged, all the females manifesting want of appetites, though the\r\ntwo men were unchanged in this particular. It was early when the\r\nparty arose, and there still remained several hours before it would be\r\nnecessary for the prisoner to leave his friends. The knowledge of this\r\ncircumstance, and the interest all felt in his welfare, induced the\r\nwhole to assemble on the platform again, in the desire to be near the\r\nexpected victim, to listen to his discourse, and if possible to show\r\ntheir interest in him by anticipating his wishes. Deerslayer, himself,\r\nso far as human eyes could penetrate, was wholly unmoved, conversing\r\ncheerfully and naturally, though he avoided any direct allusions to the\r\nexpected and great event of the day. If any evidence could be discovered\r\nof his thought\'s reverting to that painful subject at all, it was in the\r\nmanner in which he spoke of death and the last great change.\r\n\r\n"Grieve not, Hetty," he said, for it was while consoling this\r\nsimple-minded girl for the loss of her parents that he thus betrayed his\r\nfeelings, "since God has app\'inted that all must die. Your parents, or\r\nthem you fancied your parents, which is the same thing, have gone afore\r\nyou; this is only in the order of natur\', my good gal, for the aged\r\ngo first, and the young follow. But one that had a mother like your\'n,\r\nHetty, can be at no loss to hope the best, as to how matters will turn\r\nout in another world. The Delaware, here, and Hist, believe in happy\r\nhunting grounds, and have idees befitting their notions and gifts as\r\nred-skins, but we who are of white blood hold altogether to a different\r\ndoctrine. Still, I rather conclude our heaven is their land of spirits,\r\nand that the path which leads to it will be travelled by all colours\r\nalike. \'Tis onpossible for the wicked to enter on it, I will allow, but\r\nfri\'nds can scarce be separated, though they are not of the same race\r\non \'arth. Keep up your spirits, poor Hetty, and look forward to the\r\nday when you will meet your mother ag\'in, and that without pain, or\r\nsorrowing."\r\n\r\n"I do expect to see mother," returned the truth-telling and simple girl,\r\n"but what will become of father?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a non-plusser, Delaware," said the hunter, in the Indian\r\ndialect--"yes, that is a downright non-plusser! The Muskrat was not\r\na saint on \'arth, and it\'s fair to guess he\'ll not be much of one,\r\nhereafter! Howsever, Hetty," dropping into the English by an easy\r\ntransition, "howsever, Hetty, we must all hope for the best. That is\r\nwisest, and it is much the easiest to the mind, if one can only do it.\r\nI ricommend to you, trusting to God, and putting down all misgivings and\r\nfainthearted feelin\'s. It\'s wonderful, Judith, how different people have\r\ndifferent notions about the futur\', some fancying one change, and some\r\nfancying another. I\'ve known white teachers that have thought all was\r\nspirit, hereafter, and them, ag\'in, that believed the body will be\r\ntransported to another world, much as the red-skins themselves imagine,\r\nand that we shall walk about in the flesh, and know each other, and talk\r\ntogether, and be fri\'nds there as we\'ve been fri\'nds here."\r\n\r\n"Which of these opinions is most pleasing to you, Deerslayer?" asked the\r\ngirl, willing to indulge his melancholy mood, and far from being free\r\nfrom its influence herself. "Would it be disagreeable to think that you\r\nshould meet all who are now on this platform in another world? Or have\r\nyou known enough of us here, to be glad to see us no more.\r\n\r\n"The last would make death a bitter portion; yes it would. It\'s eight\r\ngood years since the Sarpent and I began to hunt together, and the\r\nthought that we were never to meet ag\'in would be a hard thought to me.\r\nHe looks forward to the time when he shall chase a sort of spirit-deer,\r\nin company, on plains where there\'s no thorns, or brambles, or marshes,\r\nor other hardships to overcome, whereas I can\'t fall into all these\r\nnotions, seeing that they appear to be ag\'in reason. Spirits can\'t\r\neat, nor have they any use for clothes, and deer can only rightfully be\r\nchased to be slain, or slain, unless it be for the venison or the\r\nhides. Now, I find it hard to suppose that blessed spirits can be put to\r\nchasing game without an object, tormenting the dumb animals just for the\r\npleasure and agreeableness of their own amusements. I never yet pulled\r\na trigger on buck or doe, Judith, unless when food or clothes was\r\nwanting."\r\n\r\n"The recollection of which, Deerslayer, must now be a great consolation\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"It is the thought of such things, my fri\'nds, that enables a man to\r\nkeep his furlough. It might be done without it, I own; for the worst\r\nred-skins sometimes do their duty in this matter; but it makes that\r\nwhich might otherwise be hard, easy, if not altogether to our liking.\r\nNothing truly makes a bolder heart than a light conscience."\r\n\r\nJudith turned paler than ever, but she struggled for self-command, and\r\nsucceeded in obtaining it. The conflict had been severe, however, and\r\nit left her so little disposed to speak that Hetty pursued the subject.\r\nThis was done in the simple manner natural to the girl.\r\n\r\n"It would be cruel to kill the poor deer," she said, "in this world, or\r\nany other, when you don\'t want their venison, or their skins. No good\r\nwhite man, and no good red man would do it. But it\'s wicked for a\r\nChristian to talk about chasing anything in heaven. Such things are\r\nnot done before the face of God, and the missionary that teaches these\r\ndoctrines can\'t be a true missionary. He must be a wolf in sheep\'s\r\nclothing. I suppose you know what a sheep is, Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"That I do, gal, and a useful creatur\' it is, to such as like cloths\r\nbetter than skins for winter garments. I understand the natur\' of sheep,\r\nthough I\'ve had but little to do with \'em, and the natur\' of wolves too,\r\nand can take the idee of a wolf in the fleece of a sheep, though I think\r\nit would be like to prove a hot jacket for such a beast, in the warm\r\nmonths!"\r\n\r\n"And sin and hypocrisy are hot jackets, as they will find who put them\r\non," returned Hetty, positively, "so the wolf would be no worse off than\r\nthe sinner. Spirits don\'t hunt, nor trap, nor fish, nor do anything that\r\nvain men undertake, since they\'ve none of the longings of this world to\r\nfeed. Oh! Mother told me all that, years ago, and I don\'t wish to hear\r\nit denied."\r\n\r\n"Well, my good Hetty, in that case you\'d better not broach your doctrine\r\nto Hist, when she and you are alone, and the young Delaware maiden is\r\ninclined to talk religion. It\'s her fixed idee, I know, that the good\r\nwarriors do nothing but hunt and fish in the other world, though I don\'t\r\nbelieve that she fancies any of them are brought down to trapping, which\r\nis no empl\'yment for a brave. But of hunting and fishing, accordin\' to\r\nher notion, they\'ve their fill, and that, too, over the most agreeablest\r\nhunting grounds, and among game that is never out of season, and which\r\nis just actyve and instinctyve enough to give a pleasure to death. So I\r\nwouldn\'t ricommend it to you to start Hist on that idee."\r\n\r\n"Hist can\'t be so wicked as to believe any such thing," returned the\r\nother, earnestly. "No Indian hunts after he is dead."\r\n\r\n"No wicked Indian, I grant you; no wicked Indian, sartainly. He is\r\nobliged to carry the ammunition, and to look on without sharing in the\r\nsport, and to cook, and to light the fires, and to do every thing that\r\nisn\'t manful. Now, mind; I don\'t tell you these are my idees, but they\r\nare Hist\'s idees, and, therefore, for the sake of peace the less you say\r\nto her ag\'in \'em, the better."\r\n\r\n"And what are your ideas of the fate of an Indian, in the other world?"\r\ndemanded Judith, who had just found her voice.\r\n\r\n"Ah! gal, any thing but that! I am too Christianized to expect any thing\r\nso fanciful as hunting and fishing after death, nor do I believe there\r\nis one Manitou for the red-skin and another for a pale-face. You find\r\ndifferent colours on \'arth, as any one may see, but you don\'t find\r\ndifferent natur\'s. Different gifts, but only one natur\'."\r\n\r\n"In what is a gift different from a nature? Is not nature itself a gift\r\nfrom God?"\r\n\r\n"Sartain; that\'s quick-thoughted, and creditable, Judith, though the\r\nmain idee is wrong. A natur\' is the creatur\' itself; its wishes, wants,\r\nidees and feelin\'s, as all are born in him. This natur\' never can be\r\nchanged, in the main, though it may undergo some increase, or lessening.\r\nNow, gifts come of sarcumstances. Thus, if you put a man in a town, he\r\ngets town gifts; in a settlement, settlement gifts; in a forest, gifts\r\nof the woods. A soldier has soldierly gifts, and a missionary preaching\r\ngifts. All these increase and strengthen, until they get to fortify\r\nnatur\', as it might be, and excuse a thousand acts and idees. Still\r\nthe creatur\' is the same at the bottom; just as a man who is clad in\r\nregimentals is the same as the man that is clad in skins. The garments\r\nmake a change to the eye, and some change in the conduct, perhaps; but\r\nnone in the man. Herein lies the apology for gifts; seein\' that you\r\nexpect different conduct from one in silks and satins, from one in\r\nhomespun; though the Lord, who didn\'t make the dresses, but who made\r\nthe creatur\'s themselves, looks only at his own work. This isn\'t ra\'al\r\nmissionary doctrine, but it\'s as near it as a man of white colour need\r\nbe. Ah\'s! me; little did I think to be talking of such matters, to-day,\r\nbut it\'s one of our weaknesses never to know what will come to pass.\r\nStep into the Ark with me, Judith, for a minute; I wish to convarse with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nJudith complied with a willingness she could scarce conceal. Following\r\nthe hunter into the cabin, she took a seat on a stool, while the young\r\nman brought Killdeer, the rifle she had given him, out of a corner, and\r\nplaced himself on another, with the weapon laid upon his knees. After\r\nturning the piece round and round, and examining its lock and its breech\r\nwith a sort of affectionate assiduity, he laid it down and proceeded to\r\nthe subject which had induced him to desire the interview.\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Judith, to say that you gave me this rifle," he said.\r\n"I agreed to take it, because a young woman can have no particular use\r\nfor firearms. The we\'pon has a great name, and it desarves it, and\r\nought of right to be carried by some known and sure hand, for the best\r\nrepitation may be lost by careless and thoughtless handling."\r\n\r\n"Can it be in better hands than those in which it is now, Deerslayer?\r\nThomas Hutter seldom missed with it; with you it must turn out to be--"\r\n\r\n"Sartain death!" interrupted the hunter, laughing. "I once know\'d a\r\nbeaver-man that had a piece he called by that very name, but \'twas all\r\nboastfulness, for I\'ve seen Delawares that were as true with arrows,\r\nat a short range. Howsever, I\'ll not deny my gifts--for this is a gift,\r\nJudith, and not natur\'--but, I\'ll not deny my gifts, and therefore allow\r\nthat the rifle couldn\'t well be in better hands than it is at present.\r\nBut, how long will it be likely to remain there? Atween us, the truth\r\nmay be said, though I shouldn\'t like to have it known to the Sarpent and\r\nHist; but, to you the truth may be spoken, since your feelin\'s will not\r\nbe as likely to be tormented by it, as those of them that have known me\r\nlonger and better. How long am I like to own this rifle or any other?\r\nThat is a serious question for our thoughts to rest on, and should\r\nthat happen which is so likely to happen, Killdeer would be without an\r\nowner."\r\n\r\nJudith listened with apparent composure, though the conflict within\r\ncame near overpowering her. Appreciating the singular character of her\r\ncompanion, however, she succeeded in appearing calm, though, had not his\r\nattention been drawn exclusively to the rifle, a man of his keenness of\r\nobservation could scarce have failed to detect the agony of mind with\r\nwhich the girl had hearkened to his words. Her great self-command,\r\nnotwithstanding, enabled her to pursue the subject in a way still to\r\ndeceive him.\r\n\r\n"What would you have me do with the weapon," she asked, "should that\r\nwhich you seem to expect take place?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I wanted to speak to you about, Judith; that\'s just\r\nit. There\'s Chingachgook, now, though far from being parfect sartainty,\r\nwith a rifle--for few red-skins ever get to be that--though far\r\nfrom being parfect sartainty, he is respectable, and is coming on.\r\nNevertheless, he is my fri\'nd, and all the better fri\'nd, perhaps,\r\nbecause there never can be any hard feelin\'s atween us, touchin\' our\r\ngifts, his\'n bein\' red, and mine bein\' altogether white. Now, I should\r\nlike to leave Killdeer to the Sarpent, should any thing happen to keep\r\nme from doing credit and honor to your precious gift, Judith."\r\n\r\n"Leave it to whom you please, Deerslayer. The rifle is your own, to do\r\nwith as you please. Chingachgook shall have it, should you never return\r\nto claim it, if that be your wish."\r\n\r\n"Has Hetty been consulted in this matter? Property goes from the parent\r\nto the children, and not to one child, in partic\'lar!"\r\n\r\n"If you place your right on that of the law, Deerslayer, I fear none of\r\nus can claim to be the owner. Thomas Hutter was no more the father\r\nof Esther, than he was the father of Judith. Judith and Esther we are\r\ntruly, having no other name!"\r\n\r\n"There may be law in that, but there\'s no great reason, gal. Accordin\'\r\nto the custom of families, the goods are your\'n, and there\'s no one\r\nhere to gainsay it. If Hetty would only say that she is willing, my\r\nmind would be quite at ease in the matter. It\'s true, Judith, that\r\nyour sister has neither your beauty, nor your wit; but we should be the\r\ntenderest of the rights and welfare of the most weak-minded."\r\n\r\nThe girl made no answer but placing herself at a window, she summoned\r\nher sister to her side. When the question was put to Hetty, that\r\nsimple-minded and affectionate creature cheerfully assented to the\r\nproposal to confer on Deerslayer a full right of ownership to the\r\nmuch-coveted rifle. The latter now seemed perfectly happy, for the time\r\nbeing at least, and after again examining and re-examining his prize, he\r\nexpressed a determination to put its merits to a practical test, before\r\nhe left the spot. No boy could have been more eager to exhibit the\r\nqualities of his trumpet, or his crossbow, than this simple forester was\r\nto prove those of his rifle. Returning to the platform, he first took\r\nthe Delaware aside, and informed him that this celebrated piece was\r\nto become his property, in the event of any thing serious befalling\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"This is a new reason why you should be wary, Sarpent, and not run into\r\nany oncalculated danger," the hunter added, "for, it will be a victory\r\nof itself to a tribe to own such a piece as this! The Mingos will turn\r\ngreen with envy, and, what is more, they will not ventur\' heedlessly\r\nnear a village where it is known to be kept. So, look well to it,\r\nDelaware, and remember that you\'ve now to watch over a thing that has\r\nall the valie of a creatur\', without its failin\'s. Hist may be,\r\nand should be precious to you, but Killdeer will have the love and\r\nveneration of your whole people."\r\n\r\n"One rifle like another, Deerslayer," returned the Indian, in English,\r\nthe language used by the other, a little hurt at his friend\'s lowering\r\nhis betrothed to the level of a gun. "All kill; all wood and iron. Wife\r\ndear to heart; rifle good to shoot."\r\n\r\n"And what is a man in the woods without something to shoot with?--a\r\nmiserable trapper, or a forlorn broom and basket maker, at the best.\r\nSuch a man may hoe corn, and keep soul and body together, but he can\r\nnever know the savory morsels of venison, or tell a bear\'s ham from a\r\nhog\'s. Come, my fri\'nd, such another occasion may never offer ag\'in,\r\nand I feel a strong craving for a trial with this celebrated piece.\r\nYou shall bring out your own rifle, and I will just sight Killdeer in a\r\ncareless way, in order that we may know a few of its secret vartues."\r\n\r\nAs this proposition served to relieve the thoughts of the whole party,\r\nby giving them a new direction, while it was likely to produce no\r\nunpleasant results, every one was willing to enter into it; the girls\r\nbringing forth the firearms with an alacrity bordering on cheerfulness.\r\nHutter\'s armory was well supplied, possessing several rifles, all of\r\nwhich were habitually kept loaded in readiness to meet any sudden demand\r\nfor their use. On the present occasion it only remained to freshen the\r\nprimings, and each piece was in a state for service. This was soon done,\r\nas all assisted in it, the females being as expert in this part of the\r\nsystem of defence as their male companions.\r\n\r\n"Now, Sarpent, we\'ll begin in a humble way, using Old Tom\'s commoners\r\nfirst, and coming to your we\'pon and Killdeer as the winding up\r\nobservations," said Deerslayer, delighted to be again, weapon in hand,\r\nready to display his skill. "Here\'s birds in abundance, some in, and\r\nsome over the lake, and they keep at just a good range, hovering round\r\nthe hut. Speak your mind, Delaware, and p\'int out the creatur\' you wish\r\nto alarm. Here\'s a diver nearest in, off to the eastward, and that\'s a\r\ncreatur\' that buries itself at the flash, and will be like enough to try\r\nboth piece and powder."\r\n\r\nChingachgook was a man of few words. No sooner was the bird pointed out\r\nto him than he took his aim and fired. The duck dove at the flash, as\r\nhad been expected, and the bullet skipped harmlessly along the surface\r\nof the lake, first striking the water within a few inches of the spot\r\nwhere the bird had so lately swam. Deerslayer laughed, cordially and\r\nnaturally, but at the same time he threw himself into an attitude\r\nof preparation and stood keenly watching the sheet of placid water.\r\nPresently a dark spot appeared, and then the duck arose to breathe, and\r\nshook its wings. While in this act, a bullet passed directly through\r\nits breast, actually turning it over lifeless on its back. At the next\r\nmoment, Deerslayer stood with the breech of his rifle on the platform,\r\nas tranquil as if nothing had happened, though laughing in his own\r\npeculiar manner.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no great trial of the pieces in that!" he said, as if anxious\r\nto prevent a false impression of his own merit. "No, that proof\'s\r\nneither for nor ag\'in the rifles, seeing it was all quickness of hand\r\nand eye. I took the bird at a disadvantage, or he might have got under,\r\nagain, afore the bullet reached him. But the Sarpent is too wise to mind\r\nsuch tricks, having long been used to them. Do you remember the time,\r\nchief, when you thought yourself sartain of the wild-goose, and I took\r\nhim out of your very eyes, as it might be with a little smoke! Howsever,\r\nsuch things pass for nothing atween fri\'nds, and young folk will have\r\ntheir fun, Judith. Ay; here\'s just the bird we want, for it\'s as good\r\nfor the fire, as it is for the aim, and nothing should be lost that can\r\nbe turned to just account. There, further north, Delaware."\r\n\r\nThe latter looked in the required direction, and he soon saw a large\r\nblack duck floating in stately repose on the water. At that distant day,\r\nwhen so few men were present to derange the harmony of the wilderness,\r\nall the smaller lakes with which the interior of New York so abounds\r\nwere places of resort for the migratory aquatic birds, and this sheet\r\nlike the others had once been much frequented by all the varieties of\r\nthe duck, by the goose, the gull, and the loon. On the appearance of\r\nHutter, the spot was comparatively deserted for other sheets, more\r\nretired and remote, though some of each species continued to resort\r\nthither, as indeed they do to the present hour. At that instant, a\r\nhundred birds were visible from the castle, sleeping on the water or\r\nlaying their feathers in the limpid element, though no other offered so\r\nfavorable a mark as that Deerslayer had just pointed out to his friend.\r\nChingachgook, as usual, spared his words, and proceeded to execution.\r\nThis time his aim was more careful than before, and his success in\r\nproportion. The bird had a wing crippled, and fluttered along the water\r\nscreaming, materially increasing its distance from its enemies.\r\n\r\n"That bird must be put out of pain," exclaimed Deerslayer, the moment\r\nthe animal endeavored to rise on the wing, "and this is the rifle and\r\nthe eye to do it."\r\n\r\nThe duck was still floundering along, when the fatal bullet overtook it,\r\nsevering the head from the neck as neatly as if it had been done with\r\nan axe. Hist had indulged in a low cry of delight at the success of the\r\nyoung Indian, but now she affected to frown and resent the greater skill\r\nof his friend. The chief, on the contrary, uttered the usual exclamation\r\nof pleasure, and his smile proved how much he admired, and how little he\r\nenvied.\r\n\r\n"Never mind the gal, Sarpent, never mind Hist\'s feelin\'s, which will\r\nneither choke, nor drown, slay nor beautify," said Deerslayer, laughing.\r\n"\'Tis nat\'ral for women to enter into their husband\'s victories and\r\ndefeats, and you are as good as man and wife, so far as prejudyce and\r\nfri\'ndship go. Here is a bird over head that will put the pieces to the\r\nproof. I challenge you to an upward aim, with a flying target. That\'s\r\na ra\'al proof, and one that needs sartain rifles, as well as sartain\r\neyes."\r\n\r\nThe species of eagle that frequents the water, and lives on fish, was\r\nalso present, and one was hovering at a considerable height above the\r\nhut, greedily watching for an opportunity to make a swoop; its hungry\r\nyoung elevating their heads from a nest that was in sight, in the naked\r\nsummit of a dead pine. Chingachgook silently turned a new piece against\r\nthis bird, and after carefully watching his time, fired. A wider circuit\r\nthan common denoted that the messenger had passed through the air at no\r\ngreat distance from the bird, though it missed its object. Deerslayer,\r\nwhose aim was not more true than it was quick, fired as soon as it was\r\ncertain his friend had missed, and the deep swoop that followed left\r\nit momentarily doubtful whether the eagle was hit or not. The marksman\r\nhimself, however, proclaimed his own want of success, calling on his\r\nfriend to seize another rifle, for he saw signs on the part of the bird\r\nof an intention to quit the spot.\r\n\r\n"I made him wink, Sarpent, I do think his feathers were ruffled, but\r\nno blood has yet been drawn, nor is that old piece fit for so nice and\r\nquick a sight. Quick, Delaware, you\'ve now a better rifle, and, Judith,\r\nbring out Killdeer, for this is the occasion to try his merits, if he\r\nhas \'em."\r\n\r\nA general movement followed, each of the competitors got ready, and the\r\ngirls stood in eager expectation of the result. The eagle had made a\r\nwide circuit after his low swoop, and fanning his way upward, once more\r\nhovered nearly over the hut, at a distance even greater than before.\r\nChingachgook gazed at him, and then expressed his opinion of the\r\nimpossibility of striking a bird at that great height, and while he was\r\nso nearly perpendicular, as to the range. But a low murmur from Hist\r\nproduced a sudden impulse and he fired. The result showed how well he\r\nhad calculated, the eagle not even varying his flight, sailing round and\r\nround in his airy circle, and looking down, as if in contempt, at his\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\n"Now, Judith," cried Deerslayer, laughing, with glistening and delighted\r\neyes, "we\'ll see if Killdeer isn\'t Killeagle, too! Give me room\r\nSarpent, and watch the reason of the aim, for by reason any thing may be\r\nl\'arned."\r\n\r\nA careful sight followed, and was repeated again and again, the bird\r\ncontinuing to rise higher and higher. Then followed the flash and the\r\nreport. The swift messenger sped upward, and, at the next instant, the\r\nbird turned on its side, and came swooping down, now struggling with\r\none wing and then with the other, sometimes whirling in a circuit,\r\nnext fanning desperately as if conscious of its injury, until, having\r\ndescribed several complete circles around the spot, it fell heavily into\r\nthe end of the Ark. On examining the body, it was found that the\r\nbullet had pierced it about half way between one of its wings and the\r\nbreast-bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Upon two stony tables, spread before her,\r\n    She lean\'d her bosom, more than stony hard,\r\n    There slept th\' impartial judge, and strict restorer\r\n    Of wrong, or right, with pain or with reward;\r\n    There hung the score of all our debts, the card\r\n    Where good, and bad, and life, and death, were painted;\r\n    Was never heart of mortal so untainted,\r\n    But when the roll was read, with thousand terrors fainted."\r\n\r\n    Giles Fletcher, Christ\'s Victory in Heaven, lxv.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve done an unthoughtful thing, Sarpent--yes, Judith, we\'ve done an\r\nunthoughtful thing in taking life with an object no better than vanity!"\r\nexclaimed Deerslayer, when the Delaware held up the enormous bird, by\r\nits wings, and exhibited the dying eyes riveted on its enemies with\r\nthe gaze that the helpless ever fasten on their destroyers. "\'Twas more\r\nbecomin\' two boys to gratify their feelin\'s in this onthoughtful manner,\r\nthan two warriors on a warpath, even though it be their first. Ah\'s!\r\nme; well, as a punishment I\'ll quit you at once, and when I find myself\r\nalone with them bloody-minded Mingos, it\'s more than like I\'ll have\r\noccasion to remember that life is sweet, even to the beasts of the woods\r\nand the fowls of the air. There, Judith; there\'s Kildeer; take him back,\r\nag\'in, and keep him for some hand that\'s more desarving to own such a\r\npiece."\r\n\r\n"I know of none as deserving as your own, Deerslayer," answered the girl\r\nin haste; "none but yours shall keep the rifle."\r\n\r\n"If it depended on skill, you might be right enough, gal, but we should\r\nknow when to use firearms, as well as how to use \'em. I haven\'t l\'arnt\r\nthe first duty yet, it seems; so keep the piece till I have. The sight\r\nof a dyin\' and distressed creatur\', even though it be only a bird,\r\nbrings wholesome thoughts to a man who don\'t know how soon his own time\r\nmay come, and who is pretty sartain that it will come afore the sun\r\nsets; I\'d give back all my vain feelin\'s, and rej\'icin\'s in hand and\r\neye, if that poor eagle was only on its nest ag\'in, with its young,\r\npraisin\' the Lord for anything that we can know about the matter, for\r\nhealth and strength!"\r\n\r\nThe listeners were confounded with this proof of sudden repentance in\r\nthe hunter, and that too for an indulgence so very common, that men\r\nseldom stop to weigh its consequences, or the physical suffering it may\r\nbring on the unoffending and helpless. The Delaware understood what was\r\nsaid, though he scarce understood the feelings which had prompted the\r\nwords, and by way of disposing of the difficulty, he drew his keen\r\nknife, and severed the head of the sufferer from its body.\r\n\r\n"What a thing is power!" continued the hunter, "and what a thing it is\r\nto have it, and not to know how to use it. It\'s no wonder, Judith, that\r\nthe great so often fail of their duties, when even the little and the\r\nhumble find it so hard to do what\'s right, and not to do what\'s wrong.\r\nThen, how one evil act brings others a\'ter it! Now, wasn\'t it for this\r\nfurlough of mine, which must soon take me back to the Mingos, I\'d find\r\nthis creatur\'s nest, if I travelled the woods a fortnight--though\r\nan eagle\'s nest is soon found by them that understands the bird\'s\r\nnatur\',--but I\'d travel a fortnight rather than not find it, just to put\r\nthe young, too, out of their pain."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear you say this, Deerslayer," observed Hetty, "and God\r\nwill be more apt to remember your sorrow for what you\'ve done, than the\r\nwickedness itself. I thought how wicked it was to kill harmless birds,\r\nwhile you were shooting, and meant to tell you so; but, I don\'t know how\r\nit happened,--I was so curious to see if you could hit an eagle at so\r\ngreat a height, that I forgot altogether to speak, \'till the mischief\r\nwas done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it; that\'s just it, my good Hetty. We can all see our faults and\r\nmistakes when it\'s too late to help them! Howsever I\'m glad you didn\'t\r\nspeak, for I don\'t think a word or two would have stopped me, just at\r\nthat moment, and so the sin stands in its nakedness, and not aggravated\r\nby any unheeded calls to forbear. Well, well, bitter thoughts are hard\r\nto be borne at all times, but there\'s times when they\'re harder than at\r\nothers."\r\n\r\nLittle did Deerslayer know, while thus indulging in feelings that\r\nwere natural to the man, and so strictly in accordance with his\r\nown unsophisticated and just principles, that, in the course of the\r\ninscrutable providence, which so uniformly and yet so mysteriously\r\ncovers all events with its mantle, the very fault he was disposed so\r\nseverely to censure was to be made the means of determining his own\r\nearthly fate. The mode and the moment in which he was to feel the\r\ninfluence of this interference, it would be premature to relate, but\r\nboth will appear in the course of the succeeding chapters. As for\r\nthe young man, he now slowly left the Ark, like one sorrowing for his\r\nmisdeeds, and seated himself in silence on the platform. By this time\r\nthe sun had ascended to some height, and its appearance, taken in\r\nconnection with his present feelings, induced him to prepare to depart.\r\nThe Delaware got the canoe ready for his friend, as soon as apprised of\r\nhis intention, while Hist busied herself in making the few arrangements\r\nthat were thought necessary to his comfort. All this was done without\r\nostentation, but in a way that left Deerslayer fully acquainted with,\r\nand equally disposed to appreciate, the motive. When all was ready, both\r\nreturned to the side of Judith and Hetty, neither of whom had moved from\r\nthe spot where the young hunter sat.\r\n\r\n"The best fri\'nds must often part," the last began, when he saw the\r\nwhole party grouped around him--"yes, fri\'ndship can\'t alter the ways\r\nof Providence, and let our feelin\'s be as they may, we must part. I\'ve\r\noften thought there\'s moments when our words dwell longer on the mind\r\nthan common, and when advice is remembered, just because the mouth that\r\ngives it isn\'t likely to give it ag\'in. No one knows what will happen in\r\nthis world, and therefore it may be well, when fri\'nds separate under a\r\nlikelihood that the parting may be long, to say a few words in kindness,\r\nas a sort of keepsakes. If all but one will go into the Ark, I\'ll talk\r\nto each in turn, and what is more, I\'ll listen to what you may have to\r\nsay back ag\'in, for it\'s a poor counsellor that won\'t take as well as\r\ngive."\r\n\r\nAs the meaning of the speaker was understood, the two Indians\r\nimmediately withdrew as desired, leaving the sisters, however, still\r\nstanding at the young man\'s side. A look of Deerslayer\'s induced Judith\r\nto explain.\r\n\r\n"You can advise Hetty as you land," she said hastily, "for I intend that\r\nshe shall accompany you to the shore."\r\n\r\n"Is this wise, Judith? It\'s true, that under common sarcumstances\r\na feeble mind is a great protection among red-skins, but when their\r\nfeelin\'s are up, and they\'re bent on revenge, it\'s hard to say what may\r\ncome to pass. Besides--"\r\n\r\n"What were you about to say, Deerslayer?" asked Judith, whose gentleness\r\nof voice and manner amounted nearly to tenderness, though she struggled\r\nhard to keep her emotions and apprehensions in subjection.\r\n\r\n"Why, simply that there are sights and doin\'s that one even as little\r\ngifted with reason and memory as Hetty here, might better not witness.\r\nSo, Judith, you would do well to let me land alone, and to keep your\r\nsister back."\r\n\r\n"Never fear for me, Deerslayer," put in Hetty, who comprehended enough\r\nof the discourse to know its general drift, "I\'m feeble minded, and that\r\nthey say is an excuse for going anywhere; and what that won\'t excuse,\r\nwill be overlooked on account of the Bible I always carry. It is\r\nwonderful, Judith, how all sorts of men; the trappers as well as the\r\nhunters; red-men as well as white; Mingos as well as Delawares do\r\nreverence and fear the Bible!"\r\n\r\n"I think you have not the least ground to fear any injury, Hetty,"\r\nanswered the sister, "and therefore I shall insist on your going to the\r\nHuron camp with our friend. Your being there can do no harm, not even to\r\nyourself, and may do great good to Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"This is not a moment, Judith, to dispute, and so have the matter your\r\nown way," returned the young man. "Get yourself ready, Hetty, and go\r\ninto the canoe, for I\'ve a few parting words to say to your sister,\r\nwhich can do you no good."\r\n\r\nJudith and her companion continued silent, until Hetty had so far\r\ncomplied as to leave them alone, when Deerslayer took up the subject,\r\nas if it had been interrupted by some ordinary occurrence, and in a very\r\nmatter of fact way.\r\n\r\n"Words spoken at parting, and which may be the last we ever hear from a\r\nfri\'nd are not soon forgotten," he repeated, "and so Judith, I intend\r\nto speak to you like a brother, seein\' I\'m not old enough to be your\r\nfather. In the first place, I wish to caution you ag\'in your inimies,\r\nof which two may be said to ha\'nt your very footsteps, and to beset your\r\nways. The first is oncommon good looks, which is as dangerous a foe\r\nto some young women, as a whole tribe of Mingos could prove, and which\r\ncalls for great watchfulness--not to admire and praise--but to distrust\r\nand sarcumvent. Yes, good looks may be sarcumvented, and fairly\r\noutwitted, too. In order to do this you\'ve only to remember that they\r\nmelt like the snows, and, when once gone, they never come back ag\'in.\r\nThe seasons come and go, Judith, and if we have winter, with storms and\r\nfrosts, and spring with chills and leafless trees, we have summer with\r\nits sun and glorious skies, and fall with its fruits, and a garment\r\nthrown over the forest, that no beauty of the town could rummage out of\r\nall the shops in America. \'Arth is in an etarnal round, the goodness of\r\nGod bringing back the pleasant when we\'ve had enough of the onpleasant.\r\nBut it\'s not so with good looks. They are lent for a short time in\r\nyouth, to be used and not abused, and, as I never met with a young woman\r\nto whom providence has been as bountiful as it has to you, Judith, in\r\nthis partic\'lar, I warn you, as it might be with my dyin\' breath, to\r\nbeware of the inimy--fri\'nd, or inimy, as we deal with the gift."\r\n\r\nIt was so grateful to Judith to hear these unequivocal admissions of her\r\npersonal charms, that much would have been forgiven to the man who\r\nmade them, let him be who he might. But, at that moment, and from a far\r\nbetter feeling, it would not have been easy for Deerslayer seriously\r\nto offend her, and she listened with a patience, which, had it been\r\nforetold only a week earlier, it would have excited her indignation to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n"I understand your meaning, Deerslayer," returned the girl, with a\r\nmeekness and humility that a little surprised her listener, "and hope to\r\nbe able to profit by it. But, you have mentioned only one of the enemies\r\nI have to fear; who, or what is the other."\r\n\r\n"The other is givin\' way afore your own good sense and judgment, I\r\nfind, Judith; yes, he\'s not as dangerous as I supposed. Howsever, havin\'\r\nopened the subject, it will be as well to end it honestly. The first\r\ninimy you have to be watchful of, as I\'ve already told you, Judith,\r\nis oncommon good looks, and the next is an oncommon knowledge of the\r\nsarcumstance. If the first is bad, the last doesn\'t, in any way, mend\r\nthe matter, so far as safety and peace of mind are consarned."\r\n\r\nHow much longer the young man would have gone on in his simple and\r\nunsuspecting, but well intentioned manner, it might not be easy to say,\r\nhad he not been interrupted by his listener\'s bursting into tears, and\r\ngiving way to an outbreak of feeling, which was so much the more violent\r\nfrom the fact that it had been with so much difficulty suppressed. At\r\nfirst her sobs were so violent and uncontrollable that Deerslayer was a\r\nlittle appalled, and he was abundantly repentant from the instant that\r\nhe discovered how much greater was the effect produced by his words than\r\nhe had anticipated. Even the austere and exacting are usually appeased\r\nby the signs of contrition, but the nature of Deerslayer did not require\r\nproofs of intense feelings so strong in order to bring him down to a\r\nlevel with the regrets felt by the girl herself. He arose, as if an\r\nadder had stung him, and the accents of the mother that soothes her\r\nchild were scarcely more gentle and winning than the tones of his voice,\r\nas he now expressed his contrition at having gone so far.\r\n\r\n"It was well meant, Judith," he said, "but it was not intended to hurt\r\nyour feelin\'s so much. I have overdone the advice, I see; yes, I\'ve\r\noverdone it, and I crave your pardon for the same. Fri\'ndship\'s an awful\r\nthing! Sometimes it chides us for not having done enough; and then,\r\nag\'in it speaks in strong words for havin\' done too much. Howsever, I\r\nacknowledge I\'ve overdone the matter, and as I\'ve a ra\'al and strong\r\nregard for you, I rej\'ice to say it, inasmuch as it proves how much\r\nbetter you are, than my own vanity and consaits had made you out to be."\r\n\r\nJudith now removed her hands from her face, her tears had ceased, and\r\nshe unveiled a countenance so winning with the smile which rendered\r\nit even radiant, that the young man gazed at her, for a moment, with\r\nspeechless delight.\r\n\r\n"Say no more, Deerslayer," she hastily interposed; "it pains me to hear\r\nyou find fault with yourself. I know my own weakness, all the better,\r\nnow I see that you have discovered it; the lesson, bitter as I have\r\nfound it for a moment, shall not be forgotten. We will not talk any\r\nlonger of these things, for I do not feel myself brave enough for the\r\nundertaking, and I should not like the Delaware, or Hist, or even Hetty,\r\nto notice my weakness. Farewell, Deerslayer; may God bless and protect\r\nyou as your honest heart deserves blessings and protection, and as I\r\nmust think he will."\r\n\r\nJudith had so far regained the superiority that properly belonged to her\r\nbetter education, high spirit, and surpassing personal advantages, as\r\nto preserve the ascendancy she had thus accidentally obtained, and\r\neffectually prevented any return to the subject that was as singularly\r\ninterrupted, as it had been singularly introduced. The young man\r\npermitted her to have every thing her own way, and when she pressed his\r\nhard hand in both her own, he made no resistance, but submitted to the\r\nhomage as quietly, and with quite as matter of course a manner, as a\r\nsovereign would have received a similar tribute from a subject, or the\r\nmistress from her suitor. Feeling had flushed the face and illuminated\r\nthe whole countenance of the girl, and her beauty was never more\r\nresplendant than when she cast a parting glance at the youth. That\r\nglance was filled with anxiety, interest and gentle pity. At the next\r\ninstant, she darted into the hut and was seen no more, though she spoke\r\nto Hist from a window, to inform her that their friend expected her\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"You know enough of red-skin natur\', and red-skin usages, Wah-ta-Wah,\r\nto see the condition I am in on account of this furlough," commenced the\r\nhunter in Delaware, as soon as the patient and submissive girl of\r\nthat people had moved quietly to his side; "you will therefore best\r\nonderstand how onlikely I am ever to talk with you ag\'in. I\'ve but\r\nlittle to say; but that little comes from long livin\' among your people,\r\nand from havin\' obsarved and noted their usages. The life of a woman is\r\nhard at the best, but I must own, though I\'m not opinionated in favor of\r\nmy own colour, that it is harder among the red men than it is among\r\nthe pale-faces. This is a p\'int on which Christians may well boast, if\r\nboasting can be set down for Christianity in any manner or form, which I\r\nrather think it cannot. Howsever, all women have their trials. Red women\r\nhave their\'n in what I should call the nat\'ral way, while white women\r\ntake \'em innoculated like. Bear your burthen, Hist, becomingly, and\r\nremember if it be a little toilsome, how much lighter it is than that of\r\nmost Indian women. I know the Sarpent well--what I call cordially--and\r\nhe will never be a tyrant to any thing he loves, though he will expect\r\nto be treated himself like a Mohican Chief. There will be cloudy days\r\nin your lodge I suppose, for they happen under all usages, and among all\r\npeople, but, by keepin\' the windows of the heart open there will always\r\nbe room for the sunshine to enter. You come of a great stock yourself,\r\nand so does Chingachgook. It\'s not very likely that either will ever\r\nforget the sarcumstance and do any thing to disgrace your forefathers.\r\nNevertheless, likin\' is a tender plant, and never thrives long when\r\nwatered with tears. Let the \'arth around your married happiness be\r\nmoistened by the dews of kindness."\r\n\r\n"My pale brother is very wise; Wah will keep in her mind all that his\r\nwisdom tells her."\r\n\r\n"That\'s judicious and womanly, Hist. Care in listening, and\r\nstout-heartedness in holding to good counsel, is a wife\'s great\r\nprotection. And, now, ask the Sarpent to come and speak with me, for a\r\nmoment, and carry away with you all my best wishes and prayers. I shall\r\nthink of you, Hist, and of your intended husband, let what may come to\r\npass, and always wish you well, here and hereafter, whether the last is\r\nto be according to Indian idees, or Christian doctrines."\r\n\r\nHist shed no tear at parting. She was sustained by the high resolution\r\nof one who had decided on her course, but her dark eyes were luminous\r\nwith the feelings that glowed within, and her pretty countenance beamed\r\nwith an expression of determination that was in marked and singular\r\ncontrast to its ordinary gentleness. It was but a minute ere the\r\nDelaware advanced to the side of his friend with the light, noiseless\r\ntread of an Indian.\r\n\r\n"Come this-a-way, Sarpent, here more out of sight of the women,"\r\ncommenced the Deerslayer, "for I\'ve several things to say that mustn\'t\r\nso much as be suspected, much less overheard. You know too well\r\nthe natur\' of furloughs and Mingos to have any doubts or misgivin\'s\r\nconsarnin\' what is like to happen, when I get back to the camp. On them\r\ntwo p\'ints therefore, a few words will go a great way. In the first\r\nplace, chief, I wish to say a little about Hist, and the manner in which\r\nyou red men treat your wives. I suppose it\'s accordin\' to the gifts of\r\nyour people that the women should work, and the men hunt; but there\'s\r\nsuch a thing as moderation in all matters. As for huntin\', I see no good\r\nreason why any limits need be set to that, but Hist comes of too good a\r\nstock to toil like a common drudge. One of your means and standin\' need\r\nnever want for corn, or potatoes, or anything that the fields yield;\r\ntherefore, I hope the hoe will never be put into the hands of any wife\r\nof yourn. You know I am not quite a beggar, and all I own, whether in\r\nammunition, skins, arms, or calicoes, I give to Hist, should I not come\r\nback to claim them by the end of the season. This will set the maiden\r\nup, and will buy labor for her, for a long time to come. I suppose I\r\nneedn\'t tell you to love the young woman, for that you do already, and\r\nwhomsoever the man ra\'ally loves, he\'ll be likely enough to cherish.\r\nNevertheless, it can do no harm to say that kind words never rankle,\r\nwhile bitter words do. I know you\'re a man, Sarpent, that is less apt to\r\ntalk in his own lodge, than to speak at the Council Fire; but forgetful\r\nmoments may overtake us all, and the practyse of kind doin\', and kind\r\ntalkin\', is a wonderful advantage in keepin\' peace in a cabin, as well\r\nas on a hunt."\r\n\r\n"My ears are open," returned the Delaware gravely; "the words of my\r\nbrother have entered so far that they never can fall out again. They\r\nare like rings, that have no end, and cannot drop. Let him speak on; the\r\nsong of the wren and the voice of a friend never tire."\r\n\r\n"I will speak a little longer, chief, but you will excuse it for the\r\nsake of old companionship, should I now talk about myself. If the worst\r\ncomes to the worst, it\'s not likely there\'ll be much left of me but\r\nashes, so a grave would be useless, and a sort of vanity. On that score\r\nI\'m no way partic\'lar, though it might be well enough to take a look\r\nat the remains of the pile, and should any bones, or pieces be found,\r\n\'twould be more decent to gather them together, and bury them, than to\r\nlet them lie for the wolves to gnaw at, and howl over. These matters\r\ncan make no great difference in the mind, but men of white blood and\r\nChristian feelin\'s have rather a gift for graves."\r\n\r\n"It shall be done as my brother says," returned the Indian, gravely. "If\r\nhis mind is full, let him empty it in the bosom of a friend."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, Sarpent; my mind\'s easy enough; yes, it\'s tolerable easy.\r\nIdees will come uppermost that I\'m not apt to think about in common,\r\nit\'s true, but by striving ag\'in some, and lettin\' other some out, all\r\nwill come right in the long run. There\'s one thing, howsever, chief,\r\nthat does seem to me to be onreasonable, and ag\'in natur\', though the\r\nmissionaries say it\'s true, and bein\' of my religion and colour I feel\r\nbound to believe them. They say an Injin may torment and tortur\' the\r\nbody to his heart\'s content, and scalp, and cut, and tear, and burn,\r\nand consume all his inventions and deviltries, until nothin\' is left but\r\nashes, and they shall be scattered to the four winds of heaven, yet when\r\nthe trumpet of God shall sound, all will come together ag\'in, and the\r\nman will stand forth in his flesh, the same creatur\' as to looks, if not\r\nas to feelin\'s, that he was afore he was harmed!"\r\n\r\n"The missionaries are good men--mean well," returned the Delaware\r\ncourteously; "they are not great medicines. They think all they say,\r\nDeerslayer; that is no reason why warriors and orators should be all\r\nears. When Chingachgook shall see the father of Tamenund standing in his\r\nscalp, and paint, and war lock, then will he believe the missionaries."\r\n\r\n"Seein\' is believin\', of a sartainty; ahs! me--and some of us may see\r\nthese things sooner than we thought. I comprehind your meanin\' about\r\nTamenund\'s father, Sarpent, and the idee\'s a close idee. Tamenund is now\r\nan elderly man, say eighty every day of it, and his father was scalped,\r\nand tormented, and burnt, when the present prophet was a youngster. Yes,\r\nif one could see that come to pass, there wouldn\'t be much difficulty\r\nin yieldin\' faith to all that the missionaries say. Howsever, I am\r\nnot ag\'in the opinion now, for you must know, Sarpent, that the great\r\nprinciple of Christianity is to believe without seeing, and a man should\r\nalways act up to his religion and principles, let them be what they\r\nmay."\r\n\r\n"That is strange for a wise nation!" said the Delaware with emphasis.\r\n"The red man looks hard, that he may see and understand."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s plauserble, and is agreeable to mortal pride, but it\'s not\r\nas deep as it seems. If we could understand all we see, Sarpent, there\r\nmight be not only sense, but safety, in refusin\' to give faith to any\r\none thing that we might find oncomperhensible; but when there\'s so many\r\nthings about which it may be said we know nothin\' at all, why, there\'s\r\nlittle use, and no reason, in bein\' difficult touchin\' any one in\r\npartic\'lar. For my part, Delaware, all my thoughts haven\'t been on the\r\ngame, when outlyin\' in the hunts and scoutin\'s of our youth. Many\'s the\r\nhour I\'ve passed, pleasantly enough too, in what is tarmed conterplation\r\nby my people. On such occasions the mind is actyve, though the body\r\nseems lazy and listless. An open spot on a mountain side, where a wide\r\nlook can be had at the heavens and the \'arth, is a most judicious place\r\nfor a man to get a just idee of the power of the Manitou, and of his\r\nown littleness. At such times, there isn\'t any great disposition to find\r\nfault with little difficulties, in the way of comperhension, as there\r\nare so many big ones to hide them. Believin\' comes easy enough to me at\r\nsuch times, and if the Lord made man first out of \'arth, as they tell me\r\nit is written in the Bible; then turns him into dust at death; I see\r\nno great difficulty in the way to bringin\' him back in the body,\r\nthough ashes be the only substance left. These things lie beyond our\r\nunderstandin\', though they may and do lie so close to our feelin\'s. But,\r\nof all the doctrines, Sarpent, that which disturbs me, and disconsarts\r\nmy mind the most, is the one which teaches us to think that a pale-face\r\ngoes to one heaven, and a red-skin to another; it may separate in death\r\nthem which lived much together, and loved each other well, in life!"\r\n\r\n"Do the missionaries teach their white brethren to think it is so?"\r\ndemanded the Indian, with serious earnestness. "The Delawares believe\r\nthat good men and brave warriors will hunt together in the same pleasant\r\nwoods, let them belong to whatever tribe they may; that all the unjust\r\nIndians and cowards will have to sneak in with the dogs and the wolves\r\nto get venison for their lodges."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis wonderful how many consaits mankind have consarnin\' happiness and\r\nmisery, here after!" exclaimed the hunter, borne away by the power of\r\nhis own thoughts. "Some believe in burnin\'s and flames, and some think\r\npunishment is to eat with the wolves and dogs. Then, ag\'in, some fancy\r\nheaven to be only the carryin\' out of their own \'arthly longin\'s, while\r\nothers fancy it all gold and shinin\' lights! Well, I\'ve an idee of my\r\nown, in that matter, which is just this, Sarpent. Whenever I\'ve done\r\nwrong, I\'ve ginirally found \'twas owin\' to some blindness of the mind,\r\nwhich hid the right from view, and when sight has returned, then has\r\ncome sorrow and repentance. Now, I consait that, after death, when\r\nthe body is laid aside or, if used at all, is purified and without its\r\nlongin\'s, the spirit sees all things in their ra\'al lights and never\r\nbecomes blind to truth and justice. Such bein\' the case, all that has\r\nbeen done in life, is beheld as plainly as the sun is seen at noon;\r\nthe good brings joy, while the evil brings sorrow. There\'s nothin\'\r\nonreasonable in that, but it\'s agreeable to every man\'s exper\'ence."\r\n\r\n"I thought the pale-faces believed all men were wicked; who then could\r\never find the white man\'s heaven?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s ingen\'ous, but it falls short of the missionary teachin\'s.\r\nYou\'ll be Christianized one day, I make no doubt, and then \'twill all\r\ncome plain enough. You must know, Sarpent, that there\'s been a great\r\ndeed of salvation done, that, by God\'s help, enables all men to find\r\na pardon for their wickednesses, and that is the essence of the white\r\nman\'s religion. I can\'t stop to talk this matter over with you any\r\nlonger, for Hetty\'s in the canoe, and the furlough takes me away, but\r\nthe time will come I hope when you\'ll feel these things; for, after all,\r\nthey must be felt rather than reasoned about. Ah\'s! me; well, Delaware,\r\nthere\'s my hand; you know it\'s that of a fri\'nd, and will shake it as\r\nsuch, though it never has done you one half the good its owner wishes it\r\nhad."\r\n\r\nThe Indian took the offered hand, and returned its pressure warmly. Then\r\nfalling back on his acquired stoicism of manner, which so many mistake\r\nfor constitutional indifference, he drew up in reserve, and prepared\r\nto part from his friend with dignity. Deerslayer, however, was more\r\nnatural, nor would he have at all cared about giving way to his\r\nfeelings, had not the recent conduct and language of Judith given him\r\nsome secret, though ill defined apprehensions of a scene. He was too\r\nhumble to imagine the truth concerning the actual feelings of that\r\nbeautiful girl, while he was too observant not to have noted the\r\nstruggle she had maintained with herself, and which had so often led\r\nher to the very verge of discovery. That something extraordinary was\r\nconcealed in her breast he thought obvious enough, and, through a\r\nsentiment of manly delicacy that would have done credit to the highest\r\nhuman refinement, he shrunk from any exposure of her secret that might\r\nsubsequently cause regret to the girl, herself. He therefore determined\r\nto depart, now, and that without any further manifestations of feeling\r\neither from him, or from others.\r\n\r\n"God bless you! Sarpent--God bless you!" cried the hunter, as the canoe\r\nleft the side of the platform. "Your Manitou and my God only know when\r\nand where we shall meet ag\'in; I shall count it a great blessing, and a\r\nfull reward for any little good I may have done on \'arth, if we shall be\r\npermitted to know each other, and to consort together, hereafter, as we\r\nhave so long done in these pleasant woods afore us!"\r\n\r\nChingachgook waved his hand. Drawing the light blanket he wore over\r\nhis head, as a Roman would conceal his grief in his robes, he slowly\r\nwithdrew into the Ark, in order to indulge his sorrow and his musings,\r\nalone. Deerslayer did not speak again until the canoe was half-way to\r\nthe shore. Then he suddenly ceased paddling, at an interruption that\r\ncame from the mild, musical voice of Hetty.\r\n\r\n"Why do you go back to the Hurons, Deerslayer?" demanded the girl. "They\r\nsay I am feeble-minded, and such they never harm, but you have as much\r\nsense as Hurry Harry; and more too, Judith thinks, though I don\'t see\r\nhow that can well be."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Hetty, afore we land I must convarse a little with you child,\r\nand that too on matters touching your own welfare, principally. Stop\r\npaddling--or, rather, that the Mingos needn\'t think we are plotting and\r\ncontriving, and so treat us accordingly, just dip your paddle lightly,\r\nand give the canoe a little motion and no more. That\'s just the idee and\r\nthe movement; I see you\'re ready enough at an appearance, and might be\r\nmade useful at a sarcumvention if it was lawful now to use one--that\'s\r\njust the idee and the movement! Ah\'s! me. Desait and a false tongue are\r\nevil things, and altogether onbecoming our colour, Hetty, but it is a\r\npleasure and a satisfaction to outdo the contrivances of a red-skin in\r\nthe strife of lawful warfare. My path has been short, and is like soon\r\nto have an end, but I can see that the wanderings of a warrior aren\'t\r\naltogether among brambles and difficulties. There\'s a bright side to a\r\nwarpath, as well as to most other things, if we\'ll only have the wisdom\r\nto see it, and the ginerosity to own it."\r\n\r\n"And why should your warpath, as you call it, come so near to an end,\r\nDeerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"Because, my good girl, my furlough comes so near to an end. They\'re\r\nlikely to have pretty much the same tarmination, as regards time, one\r\nfollowing on the heels of the other, as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand your meaning, Deerslayer--" returned the girl,\r\nlooking a little bewildered. "Mother always said people ought to speak\r\nmore plainly to me than to most other persons, because I\'m feeble\r\nminded. Those that are feeble minded, don\'t understand as easily as\r\nthose that have sense."\r\n\r\n"Well then, Hetty, the simple truth is this. You know that I\'m now a\r\ncaptyve to the Hurons, and captyves can\'t do, in all things, as they\r\nplease--"\r\n\r\n"But how can you be a captive," eagerly interrupted the girl--"when you\r\nare out here on the lake, in father\'s best canoe, and the Indians are in\r\nthe woods with no canoe at all? That can\'t be true, Deerslayer!"\r\n\r\n"I wish with all my heart and soul, Hetty, that you was right, and that\r\nI was wrong, instead of your bein\' all wrong, and I bein\' only too near\r\nthe truth. Free as I seem to your eyes, gal, I\'m bound hand and foot in\r\nra\'ality."\r\n\r\n"Well it is a great misfortune not to have sense! Now I can\'t see or\r\nunderstand that you are a captive, or bound in any manner. If you are\r\nbound, with what are your hands and feet fastened?"\r\n\r\n"With a furlough, gal; that\'s a thong that binds tighter than any\r\nchain. One may be broken, but the other can\'t. Ropes and chains allow of\r\nknives, and desait, and contrivances; but a furlough can be neither cut,\r\nslipped nor sarcumvented."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a thing is a furlough, then, if it be stronger than hemp\r\nor iron? I never saw a furlough."\r\n\r\n"I hope you may never feel one, gal; the tie is altogether in the\r\nfeelin\'s, in these matters, and therefore is to be felt and not seen.\r\nYou can understand what it is to give a promise, I dare to say, good\r\nlittle Hetty?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. A promise is to say you will do a thing, and that binds you\r\nto be as good as your word. Mother always kept her promises to me, and\r\nthen she said it would be wicked if I didn\'t keep my promises to her,\r\nand to every body else."\r\n\r\n"You have had a good mother, in some matters, child, whatever she may\r\nhave been in other some. That is a promise, and as you say it must be\r\nkept. Now, I fell into the hands of the Mingos last night, and they let\r\nme come off to see my fri\'nds and send messages in to my own colour, if\r\nany such feel consarn on my account, on condition that I shall be back\r\nwhen the sun is up to-day, and take whatever their revenge and hatred\r\ncan contrive, in the way of torments, in satisfaction for the life of\r\na warrior that fell by my rifle, as well as for that of the young woman\r\nshot by Hurry, and other disapp\'intments met with on and about this\r\nlake. What is called a promise atween mother and darter, or even atween\r\nstrangers in the settlements is called a furlough when given by one\r\nsoldier to another, on a warpath. And now I suppose you understand my\r\nsituation, Hetty."\r\n\r\nThe girl made no answer for some time, but she ceased paddling\r\naltogether, as if the novel idea distracted her mind too much to admit\r\nof other employment. Then she resumed the dialogue earnestly and with\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\n"Do you think the Hurons will have the heart to do what you say,\r\nDeerslayer?" she asked. "I have found them kind and harmless."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough as consarns one like you, Hetty, but it\'s a very\r\ndifferent affair when it comes to an open inimy, and he too the owner of\r\na pretty sartain rifle. I don\'t say that they bear me special malice on\r\naccount of any expl\'ites already performed, for that would be bragging,\r\nas it might be, on the varge of the grave, but it\'s no vanity to believe\r\nthat they know one of their bravest and cunnin\'est chiefs fell by my\r\nhands. Such bein\' the case, the tribe would reproach them if they failed\r\nto send the spirit of a pale-face to keep the company of the spirit of\r\ntheir red brother; always supposin\' that he can catch it. I look for\r\nno marcy, Hetty, at their hands; and my principal sorrow is that such a\r\ncalamity should befall me on my first warpath: that it would come sooner\r\nor later, every soldier counts on and expects."\r\n\r\n"The Hurons shall not harm you, Deerslayer," cried the girl, much\r\nexcited--"\'Tis wicked as well as cruel; I have the Bible, here, to tell\r\nthem so. Do you think I would stand by and see you tormented?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not, my good Hetty, I hope not; and, therefore, when the moment\r\ncomes, I expect you will move off, and not be a witness of what you\r\ncan\'t help, while it would grieve you. But, I haven\'t stopped the\r\npaddles to talk of my own afflictions and difficulties, but to speak a\r\nlittle plainly to you, gal, consarnin\' your own matters."\r\n\r\n"What can you have to say to me, Deerslayer! Since mother died, few talk\r\nto me of such things."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse, poor gal; yes, \'tis so much the worse, for one of\r\nyour state of mind needs frequent talking to, in order to escape the\r\nsnares and desaits of this wicked world. You haven\'t forgotten Hurry\r\nHarry, gal, so soon, I calculate?"\r\n\r\n"I!--I forget Henry March!" exclaimed Hetty, starting. "Why should I\r\nforget him, Deerslayer, when he is our friend, and only left us last\r\nnight. Then the large bright star that mother loved so much to gaze at\r\nwas just over the top of yonder tall pine on the mountain, as Hurry got\r\ninto the canoe; and when you landed him on the point, near the east bay,\r\nit wasn\'t more than the length of Judith\'s handsomest ribbon above it."\r\n\r\n"And how can you know how long I was gone, or how far I went to land\r\nHurry, seein\' you were not with us, and the distance was so great, to\r\nsay nothing of the night?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I know when it was, well enough," returned Hetty\r\npositively--"There\'s more ways than one for counting time and distance.\r\nWhen the mind is engaged, it is better than any clock. Mine is feeble,\r\nI know, but it goes true enough in all that touches poor Hurry Harry.\r\nJudith will never marry March, Deerslayer."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the p\'int, Hetty; that\'s the very p\'int I want to come to.\r\nI suppose you know that it\'s nat\'ral for young people to have kind\r\nfeelin\'s for one another, more especially when one happens to be a youth\r\nand t\'other a maiden. Now, one of your years and mind, gal, that has\r\nneither father nor mother, and who lives in a wilderness frequented by\r\nhunters and trappers, needs be on her guard against evils she little\r\ndreams of."\r\n\r\n"What harm can it be to think well of a fellow creature," returned Hetty\r\nsimply, though the conscious blood was stealing to her cheeks in spite\r\nof a spirit so pure that it scarce knew why it prompted the blush, "the\r\nBible tells us to \'love them who despitefully use\' us, and why shouldn\'t\r\nwe like them that do not."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Hetty, the love of the missionaries isn\'t the sort of likin\' I\r\nmean. Answer me one thing, child; do you believe yourself to have mind\r\nenough to become a wife, and a mother?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a proper question to ask a young woman, Deerslayer, and\r\nI\'ll not answer it," returned the girl, in a reproving manner--much as\r\na parent rebukes a child for an act of indiscretion. "If you have any\r\nthing to say about Hurry, I\'ll hear that--but you must not speak evil of\r\nhim; he is absent, and \'tis unkind to talk evil of the absent."\r\n\r\n"Your mother has given you so many good lessons, Hetty, that my fears\r\nfor you are not as great as they were. Nevertheless, a young woman\r\nwithout parents, in your state of mind, and who is not without beauty,\r\nmust always be in danger in such a lawless region as this. I would say\r\nnothin\' amiss of Hurry, who, in the main, is not a bad man for one\r\nof his callin\', but you ought to know one thing, which it may not be\r\naltogether pleasant to tell you, but which must be said. March has a\r\ndesperate likin\' for your sister Judith."\r\n\r\n"Well, what of that? Everybody admires Judith, she\'s so handsome, and\r\nHurry has told me, again and again, how much he wishes to marry her.\r\nBut that will never come to pass, for Judith don\'t like Hurry. She likes\r\nanother, and talks about him in her sleep; though you need not ask me\r\nwho he is, for all the gold in King George\'s crown, and all the jewels\r\ntoo, wouldn\'t tempt me to tell you his name. If sisters can\'t keep each\r\nother\'s secrets, who can?"\r\n\r\n"Sartainly, I do not wish you to tell me, Hetty, nor would it be any\r\nadvantage to a dyin\' man to know. What the tongue says when the mind\'s\r\nasleep, neither head nor heart is answerable for."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew why Judith talks so much in her sleep, about officers,\r\nand honest hearts, and false tongues, but I suppose she don\'t like to\r\ntell me, as I\'m feeble minded. Isn\'t it odd, Deerslayer, that Judith\r\ndon\'t like Hurry--he who is the bravest looking youth that ever comes\r\nupon the lake, and is as handsome as she is herself. Father always said\r\nthey would be the comeliest couple in the country, though mother didn\'t\r\nfancy March any more than Judith. There\'s no telling what will happen,\r\nthey say, until things actually come to pass."\r\n\r\n"Ahs! me--well, poor Hetty, \'tis of no great use to talk to them that\r\ncan\'t understand you, and so I\'ll say no more about what I did wish\r\nto speak of, though it lay heavy on my mind. Put the paddle in motion\r\nag\'in, gal, and we\'ll push for the shore, for the sun is nearly up, and\r\nmy furlough is almost out."\r\n\r\nThe canoe now glided ahead, holding its way towards the point where\r\nDeerslayer well knew that his enemies expected him, and where he now\r\nbegan to be afraid he might not arrive in season to redeem his\r\nplighted faith. Hetty, perceiving his impatience without very clearly\r\ncomprehending its cause, however, seconded his efforts in a way that\r\nsoon rendered their timely return no longer a matter of doubt. Then,\r\nand then only, did the young man suffer his exertions to flag, and Hetty\r\nbegan, again, to prattle in her simple confiding manner, though nothing\r\nfarther was uttered that it may be thought necessary to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Thou hast been busy, Death, this day, and yet\r\n    But half thy work is done!  The gates of hell\r\n    Are thronged, yet twice ten thousand spirits more\r\n    Who from their warm and healthful tenements\r\n    Fear no divorce; must, ere the sun go down,\r\n    Enter the world of woe!"--\r\n\r\n    Southey, Roderick, the Last of the Goths, XXIV, i-6.\r\n\r\nOne experienced in the signs of the heavens, would have seen that the\r\nsun wanted but two or three minutes of the zenith, when Deerslayer\r\nlanded on the point, where the Hurons were now encamped, nearly abreast\r\nof the castle. This spot was similar to the one already described, with\r\nthe exception that the surface of the land was less broken, and less\r\ncrowded with trees. Owing to these two circumstances, it was all the\r\nbetter suited to the purpose for which it had been selected, the space\r\nbeneath the branches bearing some resemblance to a densely wooded lawn.\r\nFavoured by its position and its spring, it had been much resorted to by\r\nsavages and hunters, and the natural grasses had succeeded their fires,\r\nleaving an appearance of sward in places, a very unusual accompaniment\r\nof the virgin forest. Nor was the margin of water fringed with bushes,\r\nas on so much of its shore, but the eye penetrated the woods immediately\r\non reaching the strand, commanding nearly the whole area of the\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\nIf it was a point of honor with the Indian warrior to redeem his word,\r\nwhen pledged to return and meet his death at a given hour, so was it\r\na point of characteristic pride to show no womanish impatience, but to\r\nreappear as nearly as possible at the appointed moment. It was well not\r\nto exceed the grace accorded by the generosity of the enemy, but it was\r\nbetter to meet it to a minute. Something of this dramatic effect mingles\r\nwith most of the graver usages of the American aborigines, and no doubt,\r\nlike the prevalence of a similar feeling among people more sophisticated\r\nand refined, may be referred to a principle of nature. We all love the\r\nwonderful, and when it comes attended by chivalrous self-devotion and a\r\nrigid regard to honor, it presents itself to our admiration in a shape\r\ndoubly attractive. As respects Deerslayer, though he took a pride in\r\nshowing his white blood, by often deviating from the usages of the\r\nred-men, he frequently dropped into their customs, and oftener into\r\ntheir feelings, unconsciously to himself, in consequence of having no\r\nother arbiters to appeal to, than their judgments and tastes. On the\r\npresent occasion, he would have abstained from betraying a feverish\r\nhaste by a too speedy return, since it would have contained a tacit\r\nadmission that the time asked for was more than had been wanted; but,\r\non the other hand, had the idea occurred to him, he would have quickened\r\nhis movements a little, in order to avoid the dramatic appearance of\r\nreturning at the precise instant set as the utmost limit of his absence.\r\nStill, accident had interfered to defeat the last intention, for when\r\nthe young man put his foot on the point, and advanced with a steady\r\ntread towards the group of chiefs that was seated in grave array on\r\na fallen tree, the oldest of their number cast his eye upward, at an\r\nopening in the trees, and pointed out to his companions the startling\r\nfact that the sun was just entering a space that was known to mark the\r\nzenith. A common, but low exclamation of surprise and admiration escaped\r\nevery mouth, and the grim warriors looked at each other, some with envy\r\nand disappointment, some with astonishment at the precise accuracy of\r\ntheir victim, and others with a more generous and liberal feeling. The\r\nAmerican Indian always deemed his moral victories the noblest, prizing\r\nthe groans and yielding of his victim under torture, more than the\r\ntrophy of his scalp; and the trophy itself more than his life. To slay,\r\nand not to bring off the proof of victory, indeed, was scarcely deemed\r\nhonorable, even these rude and fierce tenants of the forest, like their\r\nmore nurtured brethren of the court and the camp, having set up for\r\nthemselves imaginary and arbitrary points of honor, to supplant the\r\nconclusions of the right and the decisions of reason.\r\n\r\nThe Hurons had been divided in their opinions concerning the probability\r\nof their captive\'s return. Most among them, indeed, had not expected it\r\npossible for a pale-face to come back voluntarily, and meet the known\r\npenalties of an Indian torture; but a few of the seniors expected better\r\nthings from one who had already shown himself so singularly cool, brave\r\nand upright. The party had come to its decision, however, less in\r\nthe expectation of finding the pledge redeemed, than in the hope of\r\ndisgracing the Delawares by casting into their teeth the delinquency\r\nof one bred in their villages. They would have greatly preferred that\r\nChingachgook should be their prisoner, and prove the traitor, but the\r\npale-face scion of the hated stock was no bad substitute for their\r\npurposes, failing in their designs against the ancient stem. With a\r\nview to render their triumph as signal as possible, in the event of the\r\nhour\'s passing without the reappearance of the hunter, all the warriors\r\nand scouts of the party had been called in, and the whole band, men,\r\nwomen and children, was now assembled at this single point, to be a\r\nwitness of the expected scene. As the castle was in plain view, and\r\nby no means distant, it was easily watched by daylight, and, it being\r\nthought that its inmates were now limited to Hurry, the Delaware and\r\nthe two girls, no apprehensions were felt of their being able to escape\r\nunseen. A large raft having a breast-work of logs had been prepared,\r\nand was in actual readiness to be used against either Ark or castle\r\nas occasion might require, so soon as the fate of Deerslayer was\r\ndetermined, the seniors of the party having come to the opinion that it\r\nwas getting to be hazardous to delay their departure for Canada beyond\r\nthe coming night. In short the band waited merely to dispose of this\r\nsingle affair, ere it brought matters with those in the Castle to a\r\ncrisis, and prepared to commence its retreat towards the distant waters\r\nof Ontario.\r\n\r\nIt was an imposing scene into which Deerslayer now found himself\r\nadvancing. All the older warriors were seated on the trunk of the fallen\r\ntree, waiting his approach with grave decorum. On the right stood the\r\nyoung men, armed, while left was occupied by the women and children. In\r\nthe centre was an open space of considerable extent, always canopied by\r\ntrees, but from which the underbrush, dead wood, and other obstacles had\r\nbeen carefully removed. The more open area had probably been much used\r\nby former parties, for this was the place where the appearance of a\r\nsward was the most decided. The arches of the woods, even at high noon,\r\ncast their sombre shadows on the spot, which the brilliant rays of the\r\nsun that struggled through the leaves contributed to mellow, and, if\r\nsuch an expression can be used, to illuminate. It was probably from a\r\nsimilar scene that the mind of man first got its idea of the effects of\r\ngothic tracery and churchly hues, this temple of nature producing\r\nsome such effect, so far as light and shadow were concerned, as the\r\nwell-known offspring of human invention.\r\n\r\nAs was not unusual among the tribes and wandering bands of the\r\nAborigines, two chiefs shared, in nearly equal degrees, the principal\r\nand primitive authority that was wielded over these children of the\r\nforest. There were several who might claim the distinction of being\r\nchief men, but the two in question were so much superior to all the rest\r\nin influence, that, when they agreed, no one disputed their mandates,\r\nand when they were divided the band hesitated, like men who had lost\r\ntheir governing principle of action. It was also in conformity with\r\npractice, perhaps we might add in conformity with nature, that one of\r\nthe chiefs was indebted to his mind for his influence, whereas the other\r\nowed his distinction altogether to qualities that were physical. One\r\nwas a senior, well known for eloquence in debate, wisdom in council, and\r\nprudence in measures; while his great competitor, if not his rival, was\r\na brave distinguished in war, notorious for ferocity, and remarkable, in\r\nthe way of intellect, for nothing but the cunning and expedients of the\r\nwar path. The first was Rivenoak, who has already been introduced to the\r\nreader, while the last was called le Panth\'ere, in the language of the\r\nCanadas, or the Panther, to resort to the vernacular of the English\r\ncolonies. The appellation of the fighting chief was supposed to indicate\r\nthe qualities of the warrior, agreeably to a practice of the red man\'s\r\nnomenclature, ferocity, cunning and treachery being, perhaps, the\r\ndistinctive features of his character. The title had been received from\r\nthe French, and was prized so much the more from that circumstance,\r\nthe Indian submitting profoundly to the greater intelligence of his\r\npale-face allies, in most things of this nature. How well the sobriquet\r\nwas merited will be seen in the sequel.\r\n\r\nRivenoak and the Panther sat side by side awaiting the approach of their\r\nprisoner, as Deerslayer put his moccasined foot on the strand, nor did\r\neither move, or utter a syllable, until the young man had advanced into\r\nthe centre of the area, and proclaimed his presence with his voice. This\r\nwas done firmly, though in the simple manner that marked the character\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\n"Here I am, Mingos," he said, in the dialect of the Delawares, a\r\nlanguage that most present understood; "here I am, and there is the sun.\r\nOne is not more true to the laws of natur\', than the other has proved\r\ntrue to his word. I am your prisoner; do with me what you please. My\r\nbusiness with man and \'arth is settled; nothing remains now but to meet\r\nthe white man\'s God, accordin\' to a white man\'s duties and gifts."\r\n\r\nA murmur of approbation escaped even the women at this address, and, for\r\nan instant there was a strong and pretty general desire to adopt into\r\nthe tribe one who owned so brave a spirit. Still there were dissenters\r\nfrom this wish, among the principal of whom might be classed the\r\nPanther, and his sister, le Sumach, so called from the number of her\r\nchildren, who was the widow of le Loup Cervier, now known to have fallen\r\nby the hand of the captive. Native ferocity held one in subjection,\r\nwhile the corroding passion of revenge prevented the other from\r\nadmitting any gentler feeling at the moment. Not so with Rivenoak. This\r\nchief arose, stretched his arm before him in a gesture of courtesy, and\r\npaid his compliments with an ease and dignity that a prince might have\r\nenvied. As, in that band, his wisdom and eloquence were confessedly\r\nwithout rivals, he knew that on himself would properly fall the duty of\r\nfirst replying to the speech of the pale-face.\r\n\r\n"Pale-face, you are honest," said the Huron orator. "My people are happy\r\nin having captured a man, and not a skulking fox. We now know you; we\r\nshall treat you like a brave. If you have slain one of our warriors, and\r\nhelped to kill others, you have a life of your own ready to give away in\r\nreturn. Some of my young men thought that the blood of a pale-face was\r\ntoo thin; that it would refuse to run under the Huron knife. You will\r\nshow them it is not so; your heart is stout, as well as your body. It\r\nis a pleasure to make such a prisoner; should my warriors say that the\r\ndeath of le Loup Cervier ought not to be forgotten, and that he cannot\r\ntravel towards the land of spirits alone, that his enemy must be sent\r\nto overtake him, they will remember that he fell by the hand of a brave,\r\nand send you after him with such signs of our friendship as shall not\r\nmake him ashamed to keep your company. I have spoken; you know what I\r\nhave said."\r\n\r\n"True enough, Mingo, all true as the gospel," returned the simple minded\r\nhunter, "you have spoken, and I do know not only what you have said,\r\nbut, what is still more important, what you mean. I dare to say\r\nyour warrior the Lynx was a stout-hearted brave, and worthy of your\r\nfri\'ndship and respect, but I do not feel unworthy to keep his company,\r\nwithout any passport from your hands. Nevertheless, here I am, ready\r\nto receive judgment from your council, if, indeed, the matter was not\r\ndetarmined among you afore I got back."\r\n\r\n"My old men would not sit in council over a pale-face until they saw him\r\namong them," answered Rivenoak, looking around him a little ironically;\r\n"they said it would be like sitting in council over the winds; they go\r\nwhere they will, and come back as they see fit, and not otherwise. There\r\nwas one voice that spoke in your favor, Deerslayer, but it was alone,\r\nlike the song of the wren whose mate has been struck by the hawk."\r\n\r\n"I thank that voice whosever it may have been, Mingo, and will say it\r\nwas as true a voice as the rest were lying voices. A furlough is as\r\nbinding on a pale-face, if he be honest, as it is on a red-skin, and was\r\nit not so, I would never bring disgrace on the Delawares, among whom I\r\nmay be said to have received my edication. But words are useless, and\r\nlead to braggin\' feelin\'s; here I am; act your will on me."\r\n\r\nRivenoak made a sign of acquiescence, and then a short conference was\r\nprivately held among the chiefs. As soon as the latter ended, three or\r\nfour young men fell back from among the armed group, and disappeared.\r\nThen it was signified to the prisoner that he was at liberty to go at\r\nlarge on the point, until a council was held concerning his fate. There\r\nwas more of seeming, than of real confidence, however, in this apparent\r\nliberality, inasmuch as the young men mentioned already formed a line of\r\nsentinels across the breadth of the point, inland, and escape from any\r\nother part was out of the question. Even the canoe was removed beyond\r\nthis line of sentinels, to a spot where it was considered safe from\r\nany sudden attempt. These precautions did not proceed from a failure of\r\nconfidence, but from the circumstance that the prisoner had now complied\r\nwith all the required conditions of his parole, and it would have been\r\nconsidered a commendable and honorable exploit to escape from his foes.\r\nSo nice, indeed, were the distinctions drawn by the savages in cases of\r\nthis nature, that they often gave their victims a chance to evade the\r\ntorture, deeming it as creditable to the captors to overtake, or to\r\noutwit a fugitive, when his exertions were supposed to be quickened by\r\nthe extreme jeopardy of his situation, as it was for him to get clear\r\nfrom so much extraordinary vigilance.\r\n\r\nNor was Deerslayer unconscious of, or forgetful, of his rights and of\r\nhis opportunities. Could he now have seen any probable opening for an\r\nescape, the attempt would not have been delayed a minute. But the case\r\nseem\'d desperate. He was aware of the line of sentinels, and felt\r\nthe difficulty of breaking through it, unharmed. The lake offered\r\nno advantages, as the canoe would have given his foes the greatest\r\nfacilities for overtaking him; else would he have found it no difficult\r\ntask to swim as far as the castle. As he walked about the point, he even\r\nexamined the spot to ascertain if it offered no place of concealment,\r\nbut its openness, its size, and the hundred watchful glances that were\r\nturned towards him, even while those who made them affected not to\r\nsee him, prevented any such expedient from succeeding. The dread and\r\ndisgrace of failure had no influence on Deerslayer, who deemed it even\r\na point of honor to reason and feel like a white man, rather than as an\r\nIndian, and who felt it a sort of duty to do all he could that did not\r\ninvolve a dereliction from principle, in order to save his life. Still\r\nhe hesitated about making the effort, for he also felt that he ought to\r\nsee the chance of success before he committed himself.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the business of the camp appeared to proceed in its\r\nregular train. The chiefs consulted apart, admitting no one but the\r\nSumach to their councils, for she, the widow of the fallen warrior,\r\nhad an exclusive right to be heard on such an occasion. The young men\r\nstrolled about in indolent listlessness, awaiting the result with Indian\r\npatience, while the females prepared the feast that was to celebrate the\r\ntermination of the affair, whether it proved fortunate or otherwise for\r\nour hero. No one betrayed feeling, and an indifferent observer, beyond\r\nthe extreme watchfulness of the sentinels, would have detected no\r\nextraordinary movement or sensation to denote the real state of things.\r\nTwo or three old women put their heads together, and it appeared\r\nunfavorably to the prospects of Deerslayer, by their scowling looks, and\r\nangry gestures; but a group of Indian girls were evidently animated by a\r\ndifferent impulse, as was apparent by stolen glances that expressed pity\r\nand regret. In this condition of the camp, an hour soon glided away.\r\n\r\nSuspense is perhaps the feeling of all others that is most difficult to\r\nbe supported. When Deerslayer landed, he fully expected in the course of\r\na few minutes to undergo the tortures of an Indian revenge, and he\r\nwas prepared to meet his fate manfully; but, the delay proved far more\r\ntrying than the nearer approach of suffering, and the intended victim\r\nbegan seriously to meditate some desperate effort at escape, as it\r\nmight be from sheer anxiety to terminate the scene, when he was suddenly\r\nsummoned, to appear once more in front of his judges, who had already\r\narranged the band in its former order, in readiness to receive him.\r\n\r\n"Killer of the Deer," commenced Rivenoak, as soon as his captive stood\r\nbefore him, "my aged men have listened to wise words; they are ready to\r\nspeak. You are a man whose fathers came from beyond the rising sun; we\r\nare children of the setting sun; we turn our faces towards the Great\r\nSweet Lakes, when we look towards our villages. It may be a wide country\r\nand full of riches towards the morning, but it is very pleasant towards\r\nthe evening. We love most to look in that direction. When we gaze at the\r\neast, we feel afraid, canoe after canoe bringing more and more of your\r\npeople in the track of the sun, as if their land was so full as to run\r\nover. The red men are few already; they have need of help. One of our\r\nbest lodges has lately been emptied by the death of its master; it will\r\nbe a long time before his son can grow big enough to sit in his place.\r\nThere is his widow; she will want venison to feed her and her children,\r\nfor her sons are yet like the young of the robin, before they quit the\r\nnest. By your hand has this great calamity befallen her. She has two\r\nduties; one to le Loup Cervier, and one to his children. Scalp for\r\nscalp, life for life, blood for blood, is one law; to feed her young,\r\nanother. We know you, Killer of the Deer. You are honest; when you say a\r\nthing, it is so. You have but one tongue, and that is not forked, like\r\na snake\'s. Your head is never hid in the grass; all can see it. What\r\nyou say, that will you do. You are just. When you have done wrong, it is\r\nyour wish to do right, again, as soon as you can. Here, is the Sumach;\r\nshe is alone in her wigwam, with children crying around her for\r\nfood--yonder is a rifle; it is loaded and ready to be fired. Take the\r\ngun, go forth and shoot a deer; bring the venison and lay it before the\r\nwidow of Le Loup Cervier, feed her children; call yourself her husband.\r\nAfter which, your heart will no longer be Delaware, but Huron; le\r\nSumach\'s ears will not hear the cries of her children; my people will\r\ncount the proper number of warriors."\r\n\r\n"I fear\'d this, Rivenoak," answered Deerslayer, when the other had\r\nceased speaking--"yes, I did dread that it would come to this. Howsever,\r\nthe truth is soon told, and that will put an end to all expectations on\r\nthis head. Mingo, I\'m white and Christian born; \'t would ill become me\r\nto take a wife, under red-skin forms, from among heathen. That which\r\nI wouldn\'t do, in peaceable times, and under a bright sun, still less\r\nwould I do behind clouds, in order to save my life. I may never marry;\r\nmost likely Providence in putting me up here in the woods, has intended\r\nI should live single, and without a lodge of my own; but should such a\r\nthing come to pass, none but a woman of my own colour and gifts shall\r\ndarken the door of my wigwam. As for feeding the young of your dead\r\nwarrior, I would do that cheerfully, could it be done without discredit;\r\nbut it cannot, seeing that I can never live in a Huron village. Your\r\nown young men must find the Sumach in venison, and the next time she\r\nmarries, let her take a husband whose legs are not long enough to\r\noverrun territory that don\'t belong to him. We fou\'t a fair battle, and\r\nhe fell; in this there is nothin\' but what a brave expects, and should\r\nbe ready to meet. As for getting a Mingo heart, as well might you expect\r\nto see gray hairs on a boy, or the blackberry growing on the pine.\r\nNo--no Huron; my gifts are white so far as wives are consarned; it is\r\nDelaware, in all things touchin\' Injins."\r\n\r\nThese words were scarcely out of the mouth of Deerslayer, before a\r\ncommon murmur betrayed the dissatisfaction with which they had been\r\nheard. The aged women, in particular, were loud in their expressions of\r\ndisgust, and the gentle Sumach, herself, a woman quite old enough to be\r\nour hero\'s mother, was not the least pacific in her denunciations.\r\nBut all the other manifestations of disappointment and discontent were\r\nthrown into the background, by the fierce resentment of the Panther.\r\nThis grim chief had thought it a degradation to permit his sister to\r\nbecome the wife of a pale-face of the Yengeese at all, and had only\r\ngiven a reluctant consent to the arrangement--one by no means unusual\r\namong the Indians, however--at the earnest solicitations of the\r\nbereaved widow; and it goaded him to the quick to find his condescension\r\nslighted, the honor he had with so much regret been persuaded to accord,\r\ncondemned. The animal from which he got his name does not glare on his\r\nintended prey with more frightful ferocity than his eyes gleamed on the\r\ncaptive, nor was his arm backward in seconding the fierce resentment\r\nthat almost consumed his breast.\r\n\r\n"Dog of the pale-faces!" he exclaimed in Iroquois, "go yell among the\r\ncurs of your own evil hunting grounds!"\r\n\r\nThe denunciation was accompanied by an appropriate action. Even while\r\nspeaking his arm was lifted, and the tomahawk hurled. Luckily the loud\r\ntones of the speaker had drawn the eye of Deerslayer towards him, else\r\nwould that moment have probably closed his career. So great was the\r\ndexterity with which this dangerous weapon was thrown, and so deadly the\r\nintent, that it would have riven the scull of the prisoner, had he not\r\nstretched forth an arm, and caught the handle in one of its turns, with\r\na readiness quite as remarkable as the skill with which the missile had\r\nbeen hurled. The projectile force was so great, notwithstanding, that\r\nwhen Deerslayer\'s arm was arrested, his hand was raised above and behind\r\nhis own head, and in the very attitude necessary to return the\r\nattack. It is not certain whether the circumstance of finding himself\r\nunexpectedly in this menacing posture and armed tempted the young man\r\nto retaliate, or whether sudden resentment overcame his forbearance and\r\nprudence. His eye kindled, however, and a small red spot appeared on\r\neach cheek, while he cast all his energy into the effort of his arm, and\r\nthrew back the weapon at his assailant. The unexpectedness of this blow\r\ncontributed to its success, the Panther neither raising an arm, nor\r\nbending his head to avoid it. The keen little axe struck the victim in\r\na perpendicular line with the nose, directly between the eyes, literally\r\nbraining him on the spot. Sallying forward, as the serpent darts at its\r\nenemy even while receiving its own death wound, this man of powerful\r\nframe fell his length into the open area formed by the circle, quivering\r\nin death. A common rush to his relief left the captive, in a single\r\ninstant, quite without the crowd, and, willing to make one desperate\r\neffort for life, he bounded off with the activity of a deer. There was\r\nbut a breathless instant, when the whole band, old and young, women\r\nand children, abandoning the lifeless body of the Panther where it lay,\r\nraised the yell of alarm and followed in pursuit.\r\n\r\nSudden as had been the event which induced Deerslayer to make this\r\ndesperate trial of speed, his mind was not wholly unprepared for the\r\nfearful emergency. In the course of the past hour, he had pondered well\r\non the chances of such an experiment, and had shrewdly calculated all\r\nthe details of success and failure. At the first leap, therefore, his\r\nbody was completely under the direction of an intelligence that turned\r\nall its efforts to the best account, and prevented everything like\r\nhesitation or indecision at the important instant of the start. To this\r\nalone was he indebted for the first great advantage, that of getting\r\nthrough the line of sentinels unharmed. The manner in which this was\r\ndone, though sufficiently simple, merits a description.\r\n\r\nAlthough the shores of the point were not fringed with bushes, as was\r\nthe case with most of the others on the lake, it was owing altogether\r\nto the circumstance that the spot had been so much used by hunters and\r\nfishermen. This fringe commenced on what might be termed the main land,\r\nand was as dense as usual, extending in long lines both north and south.\r\nIn the latter direction, then, Deerslayer held his way, and, as the\r\nsentinels were a little without the commencement of this thicket, before\r\nthe alarm was clearly communicated to them the fugitive had gained its\r\ncover. To run among the bushes, however, was out of the question, and\r\nDeerslayer held his way, for some forty or fifty yards, in the water,\r\nwhich was barely knee deep, offering as great an obstacle to the speed\r\nof his pursuers as it did to his own. As soon as a favorable spot\r\npresented, he darted through the line of bushes and issued into the open\r\nwoods. Several rifles were discharged at Deerslayer while in the water,\r\nand more followed as he came out into the comparative exposure of the\r\nclear forest. But the direction of his line of flight, which partially\r\ncrossed that of the fire, the haste with which the weapons had been\r\naimed, and the general confusion that prevailed in the camp prevented\r\nany harm from being done. Bullets whistled past him, and many cut twigs\r\nfrom the branches at his side, but not one touched even his dress. The\r\ndelay caused by these fruitless attempts was of great service to the\r\nfugitive, who had gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading\r\nmen of the Hurons, ere something like concert and order had entered\r\ninto the chase. To think of following with rifles in hand was out of\r\nthe question, and after emptying their pieces in vague hopes of wounding\r\ntheir captive, the best runners of the Indians threw them aside, calling\r\nout to the women and boys to recover and load them, again, as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer knew too well the desperate nature of the struggle in which\r\nhe was engaged to lose one of the precious moments. He also knew that\r\nhis only hope was to run in a straight line, for as soon as he began to\r\nturn, or double, the greater number of his pursuers would put escape out\r\nof the question. He held his way therefore, in a diagonal direction up\r\nthe acclivity, which was neither very high nor very steep in this part\r\nof the mountain, but which was sufficiently toilsome for one contending\r\nfor life, to render it painfully oppressive. There, however, he\r\nslackened his speed to recover breath, proceeding even at a quick walk,\r\nor a slow trot, along the more difficult parts of the way. The Hurons\r\nwere whooping and leaping behind him, but this he disregarded, well\r\nknowing they must overcome the difficulties he had surmounted ere they\r\ncould reach the elevation to which he had attained. The summit of the\r\nfirst hill was now quite near him, and he saw, by the formation of the\r\nland, that a deep glen intervened before the base of a second hill could\r\nbe reached. Walking deliberately to the summit, he glanced eagerly about\r\nhim in every direction in quest of a cover. None offered in the ground,\r\nbut a fallen tree lay near him, and desperate circumstances required\r\ndesperate remedies. This tree lay in a line parallel to the glen, at the\r\nbrow of the hill. To leap on it, and then to force his person as close\r\nas possible under its lower side, took but a moment. Previously to\r\ndisappearing from his pursuers, however, Deerslayer stood on the height\r\nand gave a cry of triumph, as if exulting at the sight of the descent\r\nthat lay before him. In the next instant he was stretched beneath the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this expedient adopted, than the young man ascertained how\r\ndesperate had been his own efforts, by the violence of the pulsations in\r\nhis frame. He could hear his heart beat, and his breathing was like the\r\naction of a bellows, in quick motion. Breath was gained, however,\r\nand the heart soon ceased to throb as if about to break through its\r\nconfinement. The footsteps of those who toiled up the opposite side\r\nof the acclivity were now audible, and presently voices and treads\r\nannounced the arrival of the pursuers. The foremost shouted as they\r\nreached the height; then, fearful that their enemy would escape under\r\nfavor of the descent, each leaped upon the fallen tree and plunged into\r\nthe ravine, trusting to get a sight of the pursued ere he reached the\r\nbottom. In this manner, Huron followed Huron until Natty began to hope\r\nthe whole had passed. Others succeeded, however, until quite forty had\r\nleaped over the tree, and then he counted them, as the surest mode of\r\nascertaining how many could be behind. Presently all were in the bottom\r\nof the glen, quite a hundred feet below him, and some had even ascended\r\npart of the opposite hill, when it became evident an inquiry was making\r\nas to the direction he had taken. This was the critical moment, and one\r\nof nerves less steady, or of a training that had been neglected, would\r\nhave seized it to rise and fly. Not so with Deerslayer. He still lay\r\nquiet, watching with jealous vigilance every movement below, and fast\r\nregaining his breath.\r\n\r\nThe Hurons now resembled a pack of hounds at fault. Little was said, but\r\neach man ran about, examining the dead leaves as the hound hunts for\r\nthe lost scent. The great number of moccasins that had passed made the\r\nexamination difficult, though the in-toe of an Indian was easily to be\r\ndistinguished from the freer and wider step of a white man. Believing\r\nthat no more pursuers remained behind, and hoping to steal away unseen,\r\nDeerslayer suddenly threw himself over the tree, and fell on the upper\r\nside. This achievement appeared to be effected successfully, and hope\r\nbeat high in the bosom of the fugitive.\r\n\r\nRising to his hands and feet, after a moment lost in listening to the\r\nsounds in the glen, in order to ascertain if he had been seen, the young\r\nman next scrambled to the top of the hill, a distance of only ten yards,\r\nin the expectation of getting its brow between him and his pursuers, and\r\nhimself so far under cover. Even this was effected, and he rose to his\r\nfeet, walking swiftly but steadily along the summit, in a direction\r\nopposite to that in which he had first fled. The nature of the calls in\r\nthe glen, however, soon made him uneasy, and he sprang upon the summit\r\nagain, in order to reconnoitre. No sooner did he reach the height than\r\nhe was seen, and the chase renewed. As it was better footing on the\r\nlevel ground, Deerslayer now avoided the side hill, holding his flight\r\nalong the ridge; while the Hurons, judging from the general formation of\r\nthe land, saw that the ridge would soon melt into the hollow, and kept\r\nto the latter, as the easiest mode of heading the fugitive. A few, at\r\nthe same time, turned south, with a view to prevent his escaping in that\r\ndirection, while some crossed his trail towards the water, in order to\r\nprevent his retreat by the lake, running southerly.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Deerslayer was now more critical than it ever had\r\nbeen. He was virtually surrounded on three sides, having the lake on\r\nthe fourth. But he had pondered well on all the chances, and took\r\nhis measures with coolness, even while at the top of his speed. As is\r\ngenerally the case with the vigorous border men, he could outrun any\r\nsingle Indian among his pursuers, who were principally formidable to\r\nhim on account of their numbers, and the advantages they possessed in\r\nposition, and he would not have hesitated to break off in a straight\r\nline at any spot, could he have got the whole band again fairly behind\r\nhim. But no such chance did, or indeed could now offer, and when he\r\nfound that he was descending towards the glen, by the melting away of\r\nthe ridge, he turned short, at right angles to his previous course,\r\nand went down the declivity with tremendous velocity, holding his way\r\ntowards the shore. Some of his pursuers came panting up the hill in\r\ndirect chase, while most still kept on in the ravine, intending to head\r\nhim at its termination.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer had now a different, though a desperate project in view.\r\nAbandoning all thoughts of escape by the woods, he made the best of his\r\nway towards the canoe. He knew where it lay; could it be reached, he had\r\nonly to run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and success would be certain.\r\nNone of the warriors had kept their weapons, which would have retarded\r\ntheir speed, and the risk would come either from the uncertain hands\r\nof the women, or from those of some well grown boy; though most of the\r\nlatter were already out in hot pursuit. Everything seemed propitious to\r\nthe execution of this plan, and the course being a continued descent,\r\nthe young man went over the ground at a rate that promised a speedy\r\ntermination to his toil.\r\n\r\nAs Deerslayer approached the point, several women and children were\r\npassed, but, though the former endeavoured to cast dried branches\r\nbetween his legs, the terror inspired by his bold retaliation on\r\nthe redoubted Panther was so great, that none dared come near enough\r\nseriously to molest him. He went by all triumphantly and reached the\r\nfringe of bushes. Plunging through these, our hero found himself once\r\nmore in the lake, and within fifty feet of the canoe. Here he ceased\r\nto run, for he well understood that his breath was now all important to\r\nhim. He even stooped, as he advanced, and cooled his parched mouth by\r\nscooping water up in his hand to drink. Still the moments pressed, and\r\nhe soon stood at the side of the canoe. The first glance told him that\r\nthe paddles had been removed! This was a sore disappointment, after all\r\nhis efforts, and, for a single moment, he thought of turning, and of\r\nfacing his foes by walking with dignity into the centre of the camp\r\nagain. But an infernal yell, such as the American savage alone can\r\nraise, proclaimed the quick approach of the nearest of his pursuers,\r\nand the instinct of life triumphed. Preparing himself duly, and giving a\r\nright direction to its bows, he ran off into the water bearing the canoe\r\nbefore him, threw all his strength and skill into a last effort, and\r\ncast himself forward so as to fall into the bottom of the light craft\r\nwithout materially impeding its way. Here he remained on his back, both\r\nto regain his breath and to cover his person from the deadly rifle.\r\nThe lightness, which was such an advantage in paddling the canoe, now\r\noperated unfavorably. The material was so like a feather, that the boat\r\nhad no momentum, else would the impulse in that smooth and placid sheet\r\nhave impelled it to a distance from the shore that would have rendered\r\npaddling with the hands safe. Could such a point once be reached,\r\nDeerslayer thought he might get far enough out to attract the attention\r\nof Chingachgook and Judith, who would not fail to come to his relief\r\nwith other canoes, a circumstance that promised everything. As the young\r\nman lay in the bottom of the canoe, he watched its movements by studying\r\nthe tops of the trees on the mountainside, and judged of his distance by\r\nthe time and the motions. Voices on the shore were now numerous, and he\r\nheard something said about manning the raft, which, fortunately for the\r\nfugitive, lay at a considerable distance on the other side of the point.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the situation of Deerslayer had not been more critical that\r\nday than it was at this moment. It certainly had not been one half as\r\ntantalizing. He lay perfectly quiet for two or three minutes, trusting\r\nto the single sense of hearing, confident that the noise in the lake\r\nwould reach his ears, did any one venture to approach by swimming.\r\nOnce or twice he fancied that the element was stirred by the cautious\r\nmovement of an arm, and then he perceived it was the wash of the water\r\non the pebbles of the strand; for, in mimicry of the ocean, it is seldom\r\nthat those little lakes are so totally tranquil as not to possess a\r\nslight heaving and setting on their shores. Suddenly all the voices\r\nceased, and a death like stillness pervaded the spot: A quietness as\r\nprofound as if all lay in the repose of inanimate life. By this time,\r\nthe canoe had drifted so far as to render nothing visible to Deerslayer,\r\nas he lay on his back, except the blue void of space, and a few of those\r\nbrighter rays that proceed from the effulgence of the sun, marking his\r\nproximity. It was not possible to endure this uncertainty long. The\r\nyoung man well knew that the profound stillness foreboded evil, the\r\nsavages never being so silent as when about to strike a blow; resembling\r\nthe stealthy foot of the panther ere he takes his leap. He took out a\r\nknife and was about to cut a hole through the bark, in order to get\r\na view of the shore, when he paused from a dread of being seen in the\r\noperation, which would direct the enemy where to aim their bullets. At\r\nthis instant a rifle was fired, and the ball pierced both sides of the\r\ncanoe, within eighteen inches of the spot where his head lay. This was\r\nclose work, but our hero had too lately gone through that which was\r\ncloser to be appalled. He lay still half a minute longer, and then he\r\nsaw the summit of an oak coming slowly within his narrow horizon.\r\n\r\nUnable to account for this change, Deerslayer could restrain his\r\nimpatience no longer. Hitching his body along, with the utmost caution,\r\nhe got his eye at the bullet hole, and fortunately commanded a very\r\ntolerable view of the point. The canoe, by one of those imperceptible\r\nimpulses that so often decide the fate of men as well as the course of\r\nthings, had inclined southerly, and was slowly drifting down the lake.\r\nIt was lucky that Deerslayer had given it a shove sufficiently vigorous\r\nto send it past the end of the point, ere it took this inclination, or\r\nit must have gone ashore again. As it was, it drifted so near it as to\r\nbring the tops of two or three trees within the range of the young man\'s\r\nview, as has been mentioned, and, indeed, to come in quite as close\r\nproximity with the extremity of the point as was at all safe. The\r\ndistance could not much have exceeded a hundred feet, though fortunately\r\na light current of air from the southwest began to set it slowly off\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer now felt the urgent necessity of resorting to some expedient\r\nto get farther from his foes, and if possible to apprise his friends\r\nof his situation. The distance rendered the last difficult, while the\r\nproximity to the point rendered the first indispensable. As was usual in\r\nsuch craft, a large, round, smooth stone was in each end of the canoe,\r\nfor the double purpose of seats and ballast; one of these was within\r\nreach of his feet. This stone he contrived to get so far between his\r\nlegs as to reach it with his hands, and then he managed to roll it to\r\nthe side of its fellow in the bows, where the two served to keep the\r\ntrim of the light boat, while he worked his own body as far aft as\r\npossible. Before quitting the shore, and as soon as he perceived that\r\nthe paddles were gone, Deerslayer had thrown a bit of dead branch into\r\nthe canoe, and this was within reach of his arm. Removing the cap he\r\nwore, he put it on the end of this stick, and just let it appear over\r\nthe edge of the canoe, as far as possible from his own person. This ruse\r\nwas scarcely adopted before the young man had a proof how much he had\r\nunderrated the intelligence of his enemies. In contempt of an artifice\r\nso shallow and common place, a bullet was fired directly through another\r\npart of the canoe, which actually raised his skin. He dropped the cap,\r\nand instantly raised it immediately over his head, as a safeguard.\r\nIt would seem that this second artifice was unseen, or what was more\r\nprobable, the Hurons feeling certain of recovering their captive, wished\r\nto take him alive.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer lay passive a few minutes longer, his eye at the bullet\r\nhole, however, and much did he rejoice at seeing that he was drifting,\r\ngradually, farther and farther from the shore. When he looked upward,\r\nthe treetops had disappeared, but he soon found that the canoe was\r\nslowly turning, so as to prevent his getting a view of anything at his\r\npeephole, but of the two extremities of the lake. He now bethought him\r\nof the stick, which was crooked and offered some facilities for rowing\r\nwithout the necessity of rising. The experiment succeeded on trial,\r\nbetter even than he had hoped, though his great embarrassment was to\r\nkeep the canoe straight. That his present manoeuvre was seen soon became\r\napparent by the clamor on the shore, and a bullet entering the stern of\r\nthe canoe traversed its length, whistling between the arms of our hero,\r\nand passed out at the head. This satisfied the fugitive that he was\r\ngetting away with tolerable speed, and induced him to increase his\r\nefforts. He was making a stronger push than common, when another\r\nmessenger from the point broke the stick out-board, and at once deprived\r\nhim of his oar. As the sound of voices seemed to grow more and more\r\ndistant, however, Deerslayer determined to leave all to the drift, until\r\nhe believed himself beyond the reach of bullets. This was nervous work,\r\nbut it was the wisest of all the expedients that offered, and the young\r\nman was encouraged to persevere in it by the circumstance that he felt\r\nhis face fanned by the air, a proof that there was a little more wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Nor widows\' tears, nor tender orphans\' cries\r\n    Can stop th\' invader\'s force;\r\n    Nor swelling seas, nor threatening skies,\r\n    Prevent the pirate\'s course:\r\n    Their lives to selfish ends decreed\r\n    Through blood and rapine they proceed;\r\n    No anxious thoughts of ill repute,\r\n    Suspend the impetuous and unjust pursuit;\r\n    But power and wealth obtain\'d, guilty and great,\r\n    Their fellow creatures\' fears they raise, or urge their hate."\r\n\r\n    Congreve, "Pindaric Ode," ii.\r\n\r\nBy this time Deerslayer had been twenty minutes in the canoe, and he\r\nbegan to grow a little impatient for some signs of relief from his\r\nfriends. The position of the boat still prevented his seeing in any\r\ndirection, unless it were up or down the lake, and, though he knew that\r\nhis line of sight must pass within a hundred yards of the castle, it,\r\nin fact, passed that distance to the westward of the buildings. The\r\nprofound stillness troubled him also, for he knew not whether to ascribe\r\nit to the increasing space between him and the Indians, or to some new\r\nartifice. At length, wearied with fruitless watchfulness, the young man\r\nturned himself on his back, closed his eyes, and awaited the result\r\nin determined acquiescence. If the savages could so completely control\r\ntheir thirst for revenge, he was resolved to be as calm as themselves,\r\nand to trust his fate to the interposition of the currents and air.\r\n\r\nSome additional ten minutes may have passed in this quiescent manner, on\r\nboth sides, when Deerslayer thought he heard a slight noise, like a low\r\nrubbing against the bottom of his canoe. He opened his eyes of course,\r\nin expectation of seeing the face or arm of an Indian rising from the\r\nwater, and found that a canopy of leaves was impending directly over\r\nhis head. Starting to his feet, the first object that met his eye was\r\nRivenoak, who had so far aided the slow progress of the boat, as to\r\ndraw it on the point, the grating on the strand being the sound that had\r\nfirst given our hero the alarm. The change in the drift of the canoe had\r\nbeen altogether owing to the baffling nature of the light currents of\r\nthe air, aided by some eddies in the water.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the Huron with a quiet gesture of authority, to order his\r\nprisoner to land, "my young friend has sailed about till he is tired; he\r\nwill forget how to run again, unless he uses his legs."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve the best of it, Huron," returned Deerslayer, stepping steadily\r\nfrom the canoe, and passively following his leader to the open area of\r\nthe point; "Providence has helped you in an onexpected manner. I\'m your\r\nprisoner ag\'in, and I hope you\'ll allow that I\'m as good at breaking\r\ngaol, as I am at keeping furloughs."\r\n\r\n"My young friend is a Moose!" exclaimed the Huron. "His legs are very\r\nlong; they have given my young men trouble. But he is not a fish; he\r\ncannot find his way in the lake. We did not shoot him; fish are taken\r\nin nets, and not killed by bullets. When he turns Moose again he will be\r\ntreated like a Moose."\r\n\r\n"Ay, have your talk, Rivenoak; make the most of your advantage. \'Tis\r\nyour right, I suppose, and I know it is your gift. On that p\'int\r\nthere\'ll be no words atween us, for all men must and ought to follow\r\ntheir gifts. Howsever, when your women begin to ta\'nt and abuse me, as I\r\nsuppose will soon happen, let \'em remember that if a pale-face struggles\r\nfor life so long as it\'s lawful and manful, he knows how to loosen his\r\nhold on it, decently, when he feels that the time has come. I\'m your\r\ncaptyve; work your will on me."\r\n\r\n"My brother has had a long run on the hills, and a pleasant sail on the\r\nwater," returned Rivenoak more mildly, smiling, at the same time, in a\r\nway that his listener knew denoted pacific intentions. "He has seen the\r\nwoods; he has seen the water. Which does he like best? Perhaps he has\r\nseen enough to change his mind, and make him hear reason."\r\n\r\n"Speak out, Huron. Something is in your thoughts, and the sooner it is\r\nsaid, the sooner you\'ll get my answer."\r\n\r\n"That is straight! There is no turning in the talk of my pale-face\r\nfriend, though he is a fox in running. I will speak to him; his ears\r\nare now open wider than before, and his eyes are not shut. The Sumach\r\nis poorer than ever. Once she had a brother and a husband. She had\r\nchildren, too. The time came and the husband started for the Happy\r\nHunting Grounds, without saying farewell; he left her alone with his\r\nchildren. This he could not help, or he would not have done it; le Loup\r\nCervier was a good husband. It was pleasant to see the venison, and wild\r\nducks, and geese, and bear\'s meat, that hung in his lodge in winter. It\r\nis now gone; it will not keep in warm weather. Who shall bring it back\r\nagain? Some thought the brother would not forget his sister, and that,\r\nnext winter, he would see that the lodge should not be empty. We thought\r\nthis; but the Panther yelled, and followed the husband on the path of\r\ndeath. They are now trying which shall first reach the Happy Hunting\r\nGrounds. Some think the Lynx can run fastest, and some think the Panther\r\ncan jump the farthest. The Sumach thinks both will travel so fast and so\r\nfar that neither will ever come back. Who shall feed her and her young?\r\nThe man who told her husband and her brother to quit her lodge, that\r\nthere might be room for him to come into it. He is a great hunter, and\r\nwe know that the woman will never want."\r\n\r\n"Ay, Huron this is soon settled, accordin\' to your notions, but it goes\r\nsorely ag\'in the grain of a white man\'s feelin\'s. I\'ve heard of men\'s\r\nsaving their lives this-a-way, and I\'ve know\'d them that would prefar\r\ndeath to such a sort of captivity. For my part, I do not seek my end,\r\nnor do I seek matrimony."\r\n\r\n"The pale-face will think of this, while my people get ready for the\r\ncouncil. He will be told what will happen. Let him remember how hard it\r\nis to lose a husband and a brother. Go; when we want him, the name of\r\nDeerslayer will be called."\r\n\r\nThis conversation had been held with no one near but the speakers. Of\r\nall the band that had so lately thronged the place, Rivenoak alone was\r\nvisible. The rest seemed to have totally abandoned the spot. Even the\r\nfurniture, clothes, arms, and other property of the camp had entirely\r\ndisappeared, and the place bore no other proofs of the crowd that had so\r\nlately occupied it, than the traces of their fires and resting places,\r\nand the trodden earth that still showed the marks of their feet. So\r\nsudden and unexpected a change caused Deerslayer a good deal of surprise\r\nand some uneasiness, for he had never known it to occur, in the course\r\nof his experience among the Delawares. He suspected, however, and\r\nrightly, that a change of encampment was intended, and that the mystery\r\nof the movement was resorted to in order to work on his apprehensions.\r\n\r\nRivenoak walked up the vista of trees as soon as he ceased speaking,\r\nleaving Deerslayer by himself. The chief disappeared behind the covers\r\nof the forest, and one unpractised in such scenes might have believed\r\nthe prisoner left to the dictates of his own judgment. But the young\r\nman, while he felt a little amazement at the dramatic aspect of things,\r\nknew his enemies too well to fancy himself at liberty, or a free\r\nagent. Still, he was ignorant how far the Hurons meant to carry\r\ntheir artifices, and he determined to bring the question, as soon as\r\npracticable, to the proof. Affecting an indifference he was far from\r\nfeeling, he strolled about the area, gradually getting nearer and nearer\r\nto the spot where he had landed, when he suddenly quickened his pace,\r\nthough carefully avoiding all appearance of flight, and pushing aside\r\nthe bushes, he stepped upon the beach. The canoe was gone, nor could he\r\nsee any traces of it, after walking to the northern and southern verges\r\nof the point, and examining the shores in both directions. It\r\nwas evidently removed beyond his reach and knowledge, and under\r\ncircumstances to show that such had been the intention of the savages.\r\n\r\nDeerslayer now better understood his actual situation. He was a prisoner\r\non the narrow tongue of land, vigilantly watched beyond a question, and\r\nwith no other means of escape than that of swimming. He, again, thought\r\nof this last expedient, but the certainty that the canoe would be sent\r\nin chase, and the desperate nature of the chances of success deterred\r\nhim from the undertaking. While on the strand, he came to a spot where\r\nthe bushes had been cut, and thrust into a small pile. Removing a few of\r\nthe upper branches, he found beneath them the dead body of the Panther.\r\nHe knew that it was kept until the savages might find a place to inter\r\nit, where it would be beyond the reach of the scalping knife. He gazed\r\nwistfully towards the castle, but there all seemed to be silent and\r\ndesolate, and a feeling of loneliness and desertion came over him to\r\nincrease the gloom of the moment.\r\n\r\n"God\'s will be done!" murmured the young man, as he walked sorrowfully\r\naway from the beach, entering again beneath the arches of the wood.\r\n"God\'s will be done, on \'arth as it is in heaven! I did hope that my\r\ndays would not be numbered so soon, but it matters little a\'ter all. A\r\nfew more winters, and a few more summers, and \'twould have been over,\r\naccordin\' to natur\'. Ah\'s! me, the young and actyve seldom think death\r\npossible, till he grins in their faces, and tells \'em the hour is come!"\r\n\r\nWhile this soliloquy was being pronounced, the hunter advanced into the\r\narea, where to his surprise he saw Hetty alone, evidently awaiting his\r\nreturn. The girl carried the Bible under her arm, and her face, over\r\nwhich a shadow of gentle melancholy was usually thrown, now seemed sad\r\nand downcast. Moving nearer, Deerslayer spoke.\r\n\r\n"Poor Hetty," he said, "times have been so troublesome, of late, that\r\nI\'d altogether forgotten you; we meet, as it might be to mourn over what\r\nis to happen. I wonder what has become of Chingachgook and Wah!"\r\n\r\n"Why did you kill the Huron, Deerslayer?--" returned the girl\r\nreproachfully. "Don\'t you know your commandments, which say \'Thou shalt\r\nnot kill!\' They tell me you have now slain the woman\'s husband and\r\nbrother!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s true, my good Hetty--\'tis gospel truth, and I\'ll not deny what has\r\ncome to pass. But, you must remember, gal, that many things are lawful\r\nin war, which would be onlawful in peace. The husband was shot in open\r\nfight--or, open so far as I was consarned, while he had a better cover\r\nthan common--and the brother brought his end on himself, by casting his\r\ntomahawk at an unarmed prisoner. Did you witness that deed, gal?"\r\n\r\n"I saw it, and was sorry it happened, Deerslayer, for I hoped you\r\nwouldn\'t have returned blow for blow, but good for evil."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Hetty, that may do among the Missionaries, but \'twould make an\r\nonsartain life in the woods! The Panther craved my blood, and he was\r\nfoolish enough to throw arms into my hands, at the very moment he was\r\nstriving a\'ter it. \'Twould have been ag\'in natur\' not to raise a hand in\r\nsuch a trial, and \'twould have done discredit to my training and gifts.\r\nNo--no--I\'m as willing to give every man his own as another, and so I\r\nhope you\'ll testify to them that will be likely to question you as to\r\nwhat you\'ve seen this day."\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer, do you mean to marry Sumach, now she has neither husband\r\nnor brother to feed her?"\r\n\r\n"Are such your idees of matrimony, Hetty! Ought the young to wive\r\nwith the old--the pale-face with the red-skin--the Christian with the\r\nheathen? It\'s ag\'in reason and natur\', and so you\'ll see, if you think\r\nof it a moment."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always heard mother say," returned Hetty, averting her face more\r\nfrom a feminine instinct than from any consciousness of wrong, "that\r\npeople should never marry until they loved each other better than\r\nbrothers and sisters, and I suppose that is what you mean. Sumach is\r\nold, and you are young!"\r\n\r\n"Ay and she\'s red, and I\'m white. Beside, Hetty, suppose you was a wife,\r\nnow, having married some young man of your own years, and state, and\r\ncolour--Hurry Harry, for instance--" Deerslayer selected this example\r\nsimply from the circumstance that he was the only young man known to\r\nboth--"and that he had fallen on a war path, would you wish to take to\r\nyour bosom, for a husband, the man that slew him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no, no--" returned the girl shuddering--"That would be wicked\r\nas well as heartless! No Christian girl could, or would do that! I never\r\nshall be the wife of Hurry, I know, but were he my husband no man should\r\never be it, again, after his death!"\r\n\r\n"I thought it would get to this, Hetty, when you come to understand\r\nsarcumstances. \'Tis a moral impossibility that I should ever marry\r\nSumach, and, though Injin weddin\'s have no priests and not much\r\nreligion, a white man who knows his gifts and duties can\'t profit by\r\nthat, and so make his escape at the fitting time. I do think death would\r\nbe more nat\'ral like, and welcome, than wedlock with this woman."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say it too loud," interrupted Hetty impatiently; "I suppose she\r\nwill not like to hear it. I\'m sure Hurry would rather marry even me than\r\nsuffer torments, though I am feeble minded; and I am sure it would kill\r\nme to think he\'d prefer death to being my husband."\r\n\r\n"Ay, gal, you ain\'t Sumach, but a comely young Christian, with a good\r\nheart, pleasant smile, and kind eye. Hurry might be proud to get you,\r\nand that, too, not in misery and sorrow, but in his best and happiest\r\ndays. Howsever, take my advice, and never talk to Hurry about these\r\nthings; he\'s only a borderer, at the best."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t tell him, for the world!" exclaimed the girl, looking about\r\nher like one affrighted, and blushing, she knew not why. "Mother always\r\nsaid young women shouldn\'t be forward, and speak their minds before\r\nthey\'re asked; Oh! I never forget what mother told me. \'Tis a pity Hurry\r\nis so handsome, Deerslayer; I do think fewer girls would like him then,\r\nand he would sooner know his own mind."\r\n\r\n"Poor gal, poor gal, it\'s plain enough how it is, but the Lord will bear\r\nin mind one of your simple heart and kind feelin\'s! We\'ll talk no more\r\nof these things; if you had reason, you\'d be sorrowful at having let\r\nothers so much into your secret. Tell me, Hetty, what has become of all\r\nthe Hurons, and why they let you roam about the p\'int as if you, too,\r\nwas a prisoner?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m no prisoner, Deerslayer, but a free girl, and go when and where I\r\nplease. Nobody dare hurt me! If they did, God would be angry, as I can\r\nshow them in the Bible. No--no--Hetty Hutter is not afraid; she\'s in\r\ngood hands. The Hurons are up yonder in the woods, and keep a good watch\r\non us both, I\'ll answer for it, since all the women and children are on\r\nthe look-out. Some are burying the body of the poor girl who was shot,\r\nso that the enemy and the wild beasts can\'t find it. I told \'em that\r\nfather and mother lay in the lake, but I wouldn\'t let them know in what\r\npart of it, for Judith and I don\'t want any of their heathenish company\r\nin our burying ground."\r\n\r\n"Ahs! me; Well, it is an awful despatch to be standing here, alive and\r\nangry, and with the feelin\'s up and ferocious, one hour, and then to be\r\ncarried away at the next, and put out of sight of mankind in a hole in\r\nthe \'arth! No one knows what will happen to him on a warpath, that\'s\r\nsartain."\r\n\r\nHere the stirring of leaves and the cracking of dried twigs interrupted\r\nthe discourse, and apprised Deerslayer of the approach of his enemies.\r\nThe Hurons closed around the spot that had been prepared for the coming\r\nscene, and in the centre of which the intended victim now stood, in a\r\ncircle, the armed men being so distributed among the feebler members\r\nof the band, that there was no safe opening through which the prisoner\r\ncould break. But the latter no longer contemplated flight, the recent\r\ntrial having satisfied him of his inability to escape when pursued so\r\nclosely by numbers. On the contrary, all his energies were aroused in\r\norder to meet his expected fate, with a calmness that should do credit\r\nto his colour and his manhood; one equally removed from recreant alarm,\r\nand savage boasting.\r\n\r\nWhen Rivenoak re-appeared in the circle, he occupied his old place at\r\nthe head of the area. Several of the elder warriors stood near him,\r\nbut, now that the brother of Sumach had fallen, there was no longer\r\nany recognised chief present whose influence and authority offered a\r\ndangerous rivalry to his own. Nevertheless, it is well known that little\r\nwhich could be called monarchical or despotic entered into the politics\r\nof the North American tribes, although the first colonists, bringing\r\nwith them to this hemisphere the notions and opinions of their own\r\ncountries, often dignified the chief men of those primitive nations\r\nwith the titles of kings and princes. Hereditary influence did certainly\r\nexist, but there is much reason to believe it existed rather as a\r\nconsequence of hereditary merit and acquired qualifications, than as a\r\nbirthright. Rivenoak, however, had not even this claim, having risen to\r\nconsideration purely by the force of talents, sagacity, and, as Bacon\r\nexpresses it in relation to all distinguished statesmen, "by a union of\r\ngreat and mean qualities;" a truth of which the career of the profound\r\nEnglishman himself furnishes so apt an illustration. Next to arms,\r\neloquence offers the great avenue to popular favor, whether it be in\r\ncivilized or savage life, and Rivenoak had succeeded, as so many have\r\nsucceeded before him, quite as much by rendering fallacies acceptable\r\nto his listeners, as by any profound or learned expositions of truth, or\r\nthe accuracy of his logic. Nevertheless, he had influence; and was far\r\nfrom being altogether without just claims to its possession. Like most\r\nmen who reason more than they feel, the Huron was not addicted to the\r\nindulgence of the more ferocious passions of his people: he had been\r\ncommonly found on the side of mercy, in all the scenes of vindictive\r\ntorture and revenge that had occurred in his tribe since his own\r\nattainment to power. On the present occasion, he was reluctant to\r\nproceed to extremities, although the provocation was so great. Still\r\nit exceeded his ingenuity to see how that alternative could well be\r\navoided. Sumach resented her rejection more than she did the deaths of\r\nher husband and brother, and there was little probability that the\r\nwoman would pardon a man who had so unequivocally preferred death to\r\nher embraces. Without her forgiveness, there was scarce a hope that\r\nthe tribe could be induced to overlook its loss, and even to Rivenoak,\r\nhimself, much as he was disposed to pardon, the fate of our hero now\r\nappeared to be almost hopelessly sealed.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole band was arrayed around the captive, a grave silence, so\r\nmuch the more threatening from its profound quiet, pervaded the\r\nplace. Deerslayer perceived that the women and boys had been preparing\r\nsplinters of the fat pine roots, which he well knew were to be stuck\r\ninto his flesh, and set in flames, while two or three of the young men\r\nheld the thongs of bark with which he was to be bound. The smoke of a\r\ndistant fire announced that the burning brands were in preparation, and\r\nseveral of the elder warriors passed their fingers over the edges of\r\ntheir tomahawks, as if to prove their keenness and temper. Even the\r\nknives seemed loosened in their sheathes, impatient for the bloody and\r\nmerciless work to begin.\r\n\r\n"Killer of the Deer," recommenced Rivenoak, certainly without any signs\r\nof sympathy or pity in his manner, though with calmness and dignity,\r\n"Killer of the Deer, it is time that my people knew their minds. The\r\nsun is no longer over our heads; tired of waiting on the Hurons, he\r\nhas begun to fall near the pines on this side of the valley. He is\r\ntravelling fast towards the country of our French fathers; it is to warn\r\nhis children that their lodges are empty, and that they ought to be at\r\nhome. The roaming wolf has his den, and he goes to it when he wishes to\r\nsee his young. The Iroquois are not poorer than the wolves. They have\r\nvillages, and wigwams, and fields of corn; the Good Spirits will be\r\ntired of watching them alone. My people must go back and see to their\r\nown business. There will be joy in the lodges when they hear our whoop\r\nfrom the forest! It will be a sorrowful whoop; when it is understood,\r\ngrief will come after it. There will be one scalp-whoop, but there\r\nwill be only one. We have the fur of the Muskrat; his body is among the\r\nfishes. Deerslayer must say whether another scalp shall be on our pole.\r\nTwo lodges are empty; a scalp, living or dead, is wanted at each door."\r\n\r\n"Then take \'em dead, Huron," firmly, but altogether without dramatic\r\nboasting, returned the captive. "My hour is come, I do suppose, and what\r\nmust be, must. If you are bent on the tortur\', I\'ll do my indivours to\r\nbear up ag\'in it, though no man can say how far his natur\' will stand\r\npain, until he\'s been tried."\r\n\r\n"The pale-face cur begins to put his tail between his legs!" cried\r\na young and garrulous savage, who bore the appropriate title of the\r\nCorbeau Rouge; a sobriquet he had gained from the French by his facility\r\nin making unseasonable noises, and an undue tendency to hear his own\r\nvoice; "he is no warrior; he has killed the Loup Cervier when looking\r\nbehind him not to see the flash of his own rifle. He grunts like a hog,\r\nalready; when the Huron women begin to torment him, he will cry like the\r\nyoung of the catamount. He is a Delaware woman, dressed in the skin of a\r\nYengeese!"\r\n\r\n"Have your say, young man; have your say," returned Deerslayer, unmoved;\r\n"you know no better, and I can overlook it. Talking may aggravate\r\nwomen, but can hardly make knives sharper, fire hotter, or rifles more\r\nsartain."\r\n\r\nRivenoak now interposed, reproving the Red Crow for his premature\r\ninterference, and then directing the proper persons to bind the captive.\r\nThis expedient was adopted, not from any apprehensions that he would\r\nescape, or from any necessity that was yet apparent of his being unable\r\nto endure the torture with his limbs free, but from an ingenious design\r\nof making him feel his helplessness, and of gradually sapping his\r\nresolution by undermining it, as it might be, little by little.\r\nDeerslayer offered no resistance. He submitted his arms and legs, freely\r\nif not cheerfully, to the ligaments of bark, which were bound around\r\nthem by order of the chief, in a way to produce as little pain as\r\npossible. These directions were secret, and given in the hope that the\r\ncaptive would finally save himself from any serious bodily suffering\r\nby consenting to take the Sumach for a wife. As soon as the body of\r\nDeerslayer was withed in bark sufficiently to create a lively sense\r\nof helplessness, he was literally carried to a young tree, and bound\r\nagainst it in a way that effectually prevented him from moving, as well\r\nas from falling. The hands were laid flat against the legs, and thongs\r\nwere passed over all, in a way nearly to incorporate the prisoner with\r\nthe tree. His cap was then removed, and he was left half-standing,\r\nhalf-sustained by his bonds, to face the coming scene in the best manner\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nPreviously to proceeding to any thing like extremities, it was the wish\r\nof Rivenoak to put his captive\'s resolution to the proof by renewing the\r\nattempt at a compromise. This could be effected only in one manner, the\r\nacquiescence of the Sumach being indispensably necessary to a compromise\r\nof her right to be revenged. With this view, then, the woman was next\r\ndesired to advance, and to look to her own interests; no agent being\r\nconsidered as efficient as the principal, herself, in this negotiation.\r\nThe Indian females, when girls, are usually mild and submissive, with\r\nmusical tones, pleasant voices and merry laughs, but toil and suffering\r\ngenerally deprive them of most of these advantages by the time they have\r\nreached an age which the Sumach had long before passed. To render their\r\nvoices harsh, it would seem to require active, malignant, passions,\r\nthough, when excited, their screams can rise to a sufficiently\r\nconspicuous degree of discordancy to assert their claim to possess\r\nthis distinctive peculiarity of the sex. The Sumach was not altogether\r\nwithout feminine attraction, however, and had so recently been deemed\r\nhandsome in her tribe, as not to have yet learned the full influence\r\nthat time and exposure produce on man, as well as on woman. By an\r\narrangement of Rivenoak\'s, some of the women around her had been\r\nemploying the time in endeavoring to persuade the bereaved widow that\r\nthere was still a hope Deerslayer might be prevailed on to enter her\r\nwigwam, in preference to entering the world of spirits, and this, too,\r\nwith a success that previous symptoms scarcely justified. All this was\r\nthe result of a resolution on the part of the chief to leave no proper\r\nmeans unemployed, in order to get transferred to his own nation the\r\ngreatest hunter that was then thought to exist in all that region,\r\nas well as a husband for a woman who he felt would be likely to be\r\ntroublesome, were any of her claims to the attention and care of the\r\ntribe overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this scheme, the Sumach had been secretly advised to\r\nadvance into the circle, and to make her appeal to the prisoner\'s sense\r\nof justice, before the band had recourse to the last experiment. The\r\nwoman, nothing loth, consented, for there was some such attraction in\r\nbecoming the wife of a noted hunter, among the females of the tribes, as\r\nis experienced by the sex, in more refined life, when they bestow their\r\nhands on the affluent. As the duties of a mother were thought to be\r\nparamount to all other considerations, the widow felt none of that\r\nembarrassment, in preferring her claims, to which even a female fortune\r\nhunter among ourselves might be liable. When she stood forth before the\r\nwhole party, therefore, the children that she led by the hands fully\r\njustified all she did.\r\n\r\n"You see me before you, cruel pale-face," the woman commenced; "your\r\nspirit must tell you my errand. I have found you; I cannot find le Loup\r\nCervier, nor the Panther; I have looked for them in the lake, in the\r\nwoods, in the clouds. I cannot say where they have gone."\r\n\r\n"No man knows, good Sumach, no man knows," interposed the captive. "When\r\nthe spirit leaves the body, it passes into a world beyond our knowledge,\r\nand the wisest way, for them that are left behind, is to hope for\r\nthe best. No doubt both your warriors have gone to the Happy Hunting\r\nGrounds, and at the proper time you will see \'em ag\'in, in their\r\nimproved state. The wife and sister of braves must have looked forward\r\nto some such tarmination of their \'arthly careers."\r\n\r\n"Cruel pale-face, what had my warriors done that you should slay them!\r\nThey were the best hunters, and the boldest young men of their tribe;\r\nthe Great Spirit intended that they should live until they withered like\r\nthe branches of the hemlock, and fell of their own weight--"\r\n\r\n"Nay--nay--good Sumach," interrupted Deerslayer, whose love of truth was\r\ntoo indomitable to listen to such hyperbole with patience, even though\r\nit came from the torn breast of a widow--"Nay--nay, good Sumach, this is\r\na little outdoing red-skin privileges. Young man was neither, any more\r\nthan you can be called a young woman, and as to the Great Spirit\'s\r\nintending that they should fall otherwise than they did, that\'s a\r\ngrievous mistake, inasmuch as what the Great Spirit intends is sartain\r\nto come to pass. Then, agin, it\'s plain enough neither of your fri\'nds\r\ndid me any harm; I raised my hand ag\'in \'em on account of what they were\r\nstriving to do, rather than what they did. This is nat\'ral law, \'to do\r\nlest you should be done by.\'"\r\n\r\n"It is so. Sumach has but one tongue; she can tell but one story. The\r\npale face struck the Hurons lest the Hurons should strike him. The\r\nHurons are a just nation; they will forget it. The chiefs will shut\r\ntheir eyes and pretend not to have seen it; the young men will believe\r\nthe Panther and the Lynx have gone to far off hunts, and the Sumach will\r\ntake her children by the hand, and go into the lodge of the pale-face\r\nand say--\'See; these are your children; they are also mine--feed us, and\r\nwe will live with you.\'"\r\n\r\n"The tarms are onadmissable, woman, and though I feel for your losses,\r\nwhich must be hard to bear, the tarms cannot be accepted. As to givin\'\r\nyou ven\'son, in case we lived near enough together, that would be no\r\ngreat expl\'ite; but as for becomin\' your husband, and the father of your\r\nchildren, to be honest with you, I feel no callin\' that-a-way."\r\n\r\n"Look at this boy, cruel pale-face; he has no father to teach him to\r\nkill the deer, or to take scalps. See this girl; what young man will\r\ncome to look for a wife in a lodge that has no head? There are more\r\namong my people in the Canadas, and the Killer of Deer will find as many\r\nmouths to feed as his heart can wish for."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, woman," exclaimed Deerslayer, whose imagination was far\r\nfrom seconding the appeal of the widow, and who began to grow restive\r\nunder the vivid pictures she was drawing, "all this is nothing to me.\r\nPeople and kindred must take care of their own fatherless, leaving them\r\nthat have no children to their own loneliness. As for me, I have no\r\noffspring, and I want no wife. Now, go away Sumach; leave me in the\r\nhands of your chiefs, for my colour, and gifts, and natur\' itself cry\r\nout ag\'in the idee of taking you for a wife."\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to expatiate on the effect of this downright refusal\r\nof the woman\'s proposals. If there was anything like tenderness in her\r\nbosom--and no woman was probably ever entirely without that feminine\r\nquality--it all disappeared at this plain announcement. Fury, rage,\r\nmortified pride, and a volcano of wrath burst out, at one explosion,\r\nconverting her into a sort of maniac, as it might beat the touch of a\r\nmagician\'s wand. Without deigning a reply in words, she made the arches\r\nof the forest ring with screams, and then flew forward at her victim,\r\nseizing him by the hair, which she appeared resolute to draw out by the\r\nroots. It was some time before her grasp could be loosened. Fortunately\r\nfor the prisoner her rage was blind; since his total helplessness left\r\nhim entirely at her mercy. Had it been better directed it might have\r\nproved fatal before any relief could have been offered. As it was, she\r\ndid succeed in wrenching out two or three handsful of hair, before the\r\nyoung men could tear her away from her victim.\r\n\r\nThe insult that had been offered to the Sumach was deemed an insult to\r\nthe whole tribe; not so much, however, on account of any respect that\r\nwas felt for the woman, as on account of the honor of the Huron nation.\r\nSumach, herself, was generally considered to be as acid as the berry\r\nfrom which she derived her name, and now that her great supporters, her\r\nhusband and brother, were both gone, few cared about concealing their\r\naversion. Nevertheless, it had become a point of honor to punish the\r\npale-face who disdained a Huron woman, and more particularly one who\r\ncoolly preferred death to relieving the tribe from the support of a\r\nwidow and her children. The young men showed an impatience to begin\r\nto torture that Rivenoak understood, and, as his older associates\r\nmanifested no disposition to permit any longer delay, he was compelled\r\nto give the signal for the infernal work to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "The ugly bear now minded not the stake,\r\n    Nor how the cruel mastiffs do him tear,\r\n    The stag lay still unroused from the brake,\r\n    The foamy boar feared not the hunter\'s spear:\r\n    All thing was still in desert, bush, and briar:"\r\n\r\n    Thomas Sackville; "The Complaint of Henry Duke of Buckingham,"\r\n    lxxxi.\r\n\r\n\'Twas one of the common expedients of the savages, on such occasions,\r\nto put the nerves of their victims to the severest proofs. On the other\r\nhand, it was a matter of Indian pride to betray no yielding to terror,\r\nor pain, but for the prisoner to provoke his enemies to such acts of\r\nviolence as would soonest produce death. Many a warrior had been known\r\nto bring his own sufferings to a more speedy termination, by taunting\r\nreproaches and reviling language, when he found that his physical system\r\nwas giving way under the agony of sufferings produced by a hellish\r\ningenuity that might well eclipse all that has been said of the infernal\r\ndevices of religious persecution. This happy expedient of taking refuge\r\nfrom the ferocity of his foes, in their passions, was denied Deerslayer\r\nhowever, by his peculiar notions of the duty of a white man, and he\r\nhad stoutly made up his mind to endure everything, in preference to\r\ndisgracing his colour.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the young men understand that they were at liberty to\r\ncommence, than some of the boldest and most forward among them sprang\r\ninto the arena, tomahawk in hand. Here they prepared to throw that\r\ndangerous weapon, the object being to strike the tree as near as\r\npossible to the victim\'s head, without absolutely hitting him. This\r\nwas so hazardous an experiment that none but those who were known to be\r\nexceedingly expert with the weapon were allowed to enter the lists\r\nat all, lest an early death might interfere with the expected\r\nentertainment. In the truest hands it was seldom that the captive\r\nescaped injury in these trials, and it often happened that death\r\nfollowed, even when the blow was not premeditated. In the particular\r\ncase of our hero, Rivenoak and the older warriors were apprehensive that\r\nthe example of the Panther\'s fate might prove a motive with some fiery\r\nspirit suddenly to sacrifice his conqueror, when the temptation of\r\neffecting it in precisely the same manner, and possibly with the\r\nidentical weapon with which the warrior had fallen, offered. This\r\ncircumstance of itself rendered the ordeal of the tomahawk doubly\r\ncritical for the Deerslayer. It would seem, however, that all who now\r\nentered what we shall call the lists, were more disposed to exhibit\r\ntheir own dexterity, than to resent the deaths of their comrades. Each\r\nprepared himself for the trial with the feelings of rivalry, rather\r\nthan with the desire for vengeance, and, for the first few minutes, the\r\nprisoner had little more connection with the result, than grew out of\r\nthe interest that necessarily attached itself to a living target. The\r\nyoung men were eager, instead of being fierce, and Rivenoak thought he\r\nstill saw signs of being able to save the life of the captive when the\r\nvanity of the young men had been gratified; always admitting that it was\r\nnot sacrificed to the delicate experiments that were about to be made.\r\nThe first youth who presented himself for the trial was called The\r\nRaven, having as yet had no opportunity of obtaining a more warlike\r\nsobriquet. He was remarkable for high pretension, rather than for skill\r\nor exploits, and those who knew his character thought the captive\r\nin imminent danger when he took his stand, and poised the tomahawk.\r\nNevertheless, the young man was good natured, and no thought was\r\nuppermost in his mind other than the desire to make a better cast than\r\nany of his fellows. Deerslayer got an inkling of this warrior\'s want\r\nof reputation by the injunctions that he had received from the seniors,\r\nwho, indeed, would have objected to his appearing in the arena, at all,\r\nbut for an influence derived from his father; an aged warrior of\r\ngreat merit, who was then in the lodges of the tribe. Still, our hero\r\nmaintained an appearance of self-possession. He had made up his mind\r\nthat his hour was come, and it would have been a mercy, instead of a\r\ncalamity, to fall by the unsteadiness of the first hand that was raised\r\nagainst him. After a suitable number of flourishes and gesticulations\r\nthat promised much more than he could perform, the Raven let the\r\ntomahawk quit his hand. The weapon whirled through the air with the\r\nusual evolutions, cut a chip from the sapling to which the prisoner was\r\nbound within a few inches of his cheek, and stuck in a large oak that\r\ngrew several yards behind him. This was decidedly a bad effort, and a\r\ncommon sneer proclaimed as much, to the great mortification of the young\r\nman. On the other hand, there was a general but suppressed murmur of\r\nadmiration at the steadiness with which the captive stood the trial. The\r\nhead was the only part he could move, and this had been purposely left\r\nfree, that the tormentors might have the amusement, and the tormented\r\nendure the shame, of his dodging, and otherwise attempting to avoid the\r\nblows. Deerslayer disappointed these hopes by a command of nerve that\r\nrendered his whole body as immovable as the tree to which he was bound.\r\nNor did he even adopt the natural and usual expedient of shutting his\r\neyes, the firmest and oldest warrior of the red-men never having more\r\ndisdainfully denied himself this advantage under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Raven had no sooner made his unsuccessful and puerile effort, than\r\nhe was succeeded by le Daim-Mose, or the Moose; a middle aged warrior\r\nwho was particularly skilful in the use of the tomahawk, and from whose\r\nattempt the spectators confidently looked for gratification. This man\r\nhad none of the good nature of the Raven, but he would gladly have\r\nsacrificed the captive to his hatred of the pale-faces generally,\r\nwere it not for the greater interest he felt in his own success as\r\none particularly skilled in the use of this weapon. He took his stand\r\nquietly, but with an air of confidence, poised his little axe but\r\na single instant, advanced a foot with a quick motion, and threw.\r\nDeerslayer saw the keen instrument whirling towards him, and believed\r\nall was over; still, he was not touched. The tomahawk had actually bound\r\nthe head of the captive to the tree, by carrying before it some of his\r\nhair, having buried itself deep beneath the soft bark. A general yell\r\nexpressed the delight of the spectators, and the Moose felt his heart\r\nsoften a little towards the prisoner, whose steadiness of nerve alone\r\nenabled him to give this evidence of his consummate skill.\r\n\r\nLe Daim-Mose was succeeded by the Bounding Boy, or le Garcon qui Bondi\r\nwho came leaping into the circle, like a hound or a goat at play. This\r\nwas one of those elastic youths whose muscles seemed always in motion,\r\nand who either affected, or who from habit was actually unable, to\r\nmove in any other manner than by showing the antics just mentioned.\r\nNevertheless, he was both brave and skilful, and had gained the respect\r\nof his people by deeds in war, as well as success in the hunts. A\r\nfar nobler name would long since have fallen to his share, had not a\r\nFrench-man of rank inadvertently given him this sobriquet, which he\r\nreligiously preserved as coming from his Great Father who lived beyond\r\nthe Wide Salt Lake. The Bounding Boy skipped about in front of the\r\ncaptive, menacing him with his tomahawk, now on one side and now on\r\nanother, and then again in front, in the vain hope of being able\r\nto extort some sign of fear by this parade of danger. At length\r\nDeerslayer\'s patience became exhausted by all this mummery, and he spoke\r\nfor the first time since the trial had actually commenced.\r\n\r\n"Throw away, Huron," he cried, "or your tomahawk will forget its ar\'n\'d.\r\nWhy do you keep loping about like a fa\'a\'n that\'s showing its dam how\r\nwell it can skip, when you\'re a warrior grown, yourself, and a warrior\r\ngrown defies you and all your silly antiks. Throw, or the Huron gals\r\nwill laugh in your face."\r\n\r\nAlthough not intended to produce such an effect, the last words aroused\r\nthe "Bounding" warrior to fury. The same nervous excitability which\r\nrendered him so active in his person, made it difficult to repress his\r\nfeelings, and the words were scarcely past the lips of the speaker\r\nthan the tomahawk left the hand of the Indian. Nor was it cast without\r\nill-will, and a fierce determination to slay. Had the intention been\r\nless deadly, the danger might have been greater. The aim was uncertain,\r\nand the weapon glanced near the cheek of the captive, slightly cutting\r\nthe shoulder in its evolutions. This was the first instance in which\r\nany other object than that of terrifying the prisoner, and of displaying\r\nskill had been manifested, and the Bounding Boy was immediately led from\r\nthe arena, and was warmly rebuked for his intemperate haste, which had\r\ncome so near defeating all the hopes of the band. To this irritable\r\nperson succeeded several other young warriors, who not only hurled the\r\ntomahawk, but who cast the knife, a far more dangerous experiment, with\r\nreckless indifference; yet they always manifested a skill that prevented\r\nany injury to the captive. Several times Deerslayer was grazed, but in\r\nno instance did he receive what might be termed a wound. The unflinching\r\nfirmness with which he faced his assailants, more especially in the sort\r\nof rally with which this trial terminated, excited a profound respect in\r\nthe spectators, and when the chiefs announced that the prisoner had\r\nwell withstood the trials of the knife and the tomahawk, there was not a\r\nsingle individual in the band who really felt any hostility towards\r\nhim, with the exception of Sumach and the Bounding Boy. These two\r\ndiscontented spirits got together, it is true, feeding each other\'s\r\nire, but as yet their malignant feelings were confined very much to\r\nthemselves, though there existed the danger that the others, ere long,\r\ncould not fail to be excited by their own efforts into that demoniacal\r\nstate which usually accompanied all similar scenes among the red men.\r\n\r\nRivenoak now told his people that the pale-face had proved himself to be\r\na man. He might live with the Delawares, but he had not been made woman\r\nwith that tribe. He wished to know whether it was the desire of the\r\nHurons to proceed any further. Even the gentlest of the females,\r\nhowever, had received too much satisfaction in the late trials to forego\r\ntheir expectations of a gratifying exhibition, and there was but one\r\nvoice in the request to proceed. The politic chief, who had some such\r\ndesire to receive so celebrated a hunter into his tribe, as a European\r\nMinister has to devise a new and available means of taxation, sought\r\nevery plausible means of arresting the trial in season, for he well\r\nknew, if permitted to go far enough to arouse the more ferocious\r\npassions of the tormentors, it would be as easy to dam the waters of\r\nthe great lakes of his own region, as to attempt to arrest them in their\r\nbloody career. He therefore called four or five of the best marksmen to\r\nhim, and bid them put the captive to the proof of the rifle, while\r\nat the same time he cautioned them touching the necessity of their\r\nmaintaining their own credit, by the closest attention to the manner of\r\nexhibiting their skill.\r\n\r\nWhen Deerslayer saw the chosen warriors step into the circle, with their\r\narms prepared for service, he felt some such relief as the miserable\r\nsufferer, who has long endured the agonies of disease, feels at the\r\ncertain approach of death. Any trifling variance in the aim of this\r\nformidable weapon would prove fatal; since, the head being the target,\r\nor rather the point it was desired to graze without injuring, an inch or\r\ntwo of difference in the line of projection must at once determine the\r\nquestion of life or death.\r\n\r\nIn the torture by the rifle there was none of the latitude permitted\r\nthat appeared in the case of even Gessler\'s apple, a hair\'s breadth\r\nbeing, in fact, the utmost limits that an expert marksman would allow\r\nhimself on an occasion like this. Victims were frequently shot through\r\nthe head by too eager or unskilful hands, and it often occurred that,\r\nexasperated by the fortitude and taunts of the prisoner, death was\r\ndealt intentionally in a moment of ungovernable irritation. All this\r\nDeerslayer well knew, for it was in relating the traditions of such\r\nscenes, as well as of the battles and victories of their people, that\r\nthe old men beguiled the long winter evenings in their cabins. He\r\nnow fully expected the end of his career, and experienced a sort of\r\nmelancholy pleasure in the idea that he was to fall by a weapon as much\r\nbeloved as the rifle. A slight interruption, however, took place before\r\nthe business was allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\nHetty Hutter witnessed all that passed, and the scene at first had\r\npressed upon her feeble mind in a way to paralyze it entirely; but, by\r\nthis time she had rallied, and was growing indignant at the unmerited\r\nsuffering the Indians were inflicting on her friend. Though timid, and\r\nshy as the young of the deer on so many occasions, this right-feeling\r\ngirl was always intrepid in the cause of humanity; the lessons of her\r\nmother, and the impulses of her own heart--perhaps we might say the\r\npromptings of that unseen and pure spirit that seemed ever to watch over\r\nand direct her actions--uniting to keep down the apprehensions of\r\nwoman, and to impel her to be bold and resolute. She now appeared in the\r\ncircle, gentle, feminine, even bashful in mien, as usual, but earnest\r\nin her words and countenance, speaking like one who knew herself to be\r\nsustained by the high authority of God.\r\n\r\n"Why do you torment Deerslayer, redmen?" she asked "What has he done\r\nthat you trifle with his life; who has given you the right to be his\r\njudges? Suppose one of your knives or tomahawks had hit him; what Indian\r\namong you all could cure the wound you would make. Besides, in harming\r\nDeerslayer, you injure your own friend; when father and Hurry Harry came\r\nafter your scalps, he refused to be of the party, and staid in the canoe\r\nby himself. You are tormenting a good friend, in tormenting this young\r\nman!"\r\n\r\nThe Hurons listened with grave attention, and one among them, who\r\nunderstood English, translated what had been said into their native\r\ntongue. As soon as Rivenoak was made acquainted with the purport of her\r\naddress he answered it in his own dialect; the interpreter conveying it\r\nto the girl in English.\r\n\r\n"My daughter is very welcome to speak," said the stern old orator, using\r\ngentle intonations and smiling as kindly as if addressing a child--"The\r\nHurons are glad to hear her voice; they listen to what she says. The\r\nGreat Spirit often speaks to men with such tongues. This time, her eyes\r\nhave not been open wide enough to see all that has happened. Deerslayer\r\ndid not come for our scalps, that is true; why did he not come? Here\r\nthey are on our heads; the war locks are ready to be taken hold of; a\r\nbold enemy ought to stretch out his hand to seize them. The Iroquois\r\nare too great a nation to punish men that take scalps. What they do\r\nthemselves, they like to see others do. Let my daughter look around\r\nher and count my warriors. Had I as many hands as four warriors, their\r\nfingers would be fewer than my people, when they came into your hunting\r\ngrounds. Now, a whole hand is missing. Where are the fingers? Two have\r\nbeen cut off by this pale-face; my Hurons wish to see if he did this by\r\nmeans of a stout heart, or by treachery. Like a skulking fox, or like a\r\nleaping panther."\r\n\r\n"You know yourself, Huron, how one of them fell. I saw it, and you all\r\nsaw it, too. \'Twas too bloody to look at; but it was not Deerslayer\'s\r\nfault. Your warrior sought his life, and he defended himself. I don\'t\r\nknow whether this good book says that it was right, but all men will\r\ndo that. Come, if you want to know which of you can shoot best, give\r\nDeerslayer a rifle, and then you will find how much more expert he is\r\nthan any of your warriors; yes, than all of them together!"\r\n\r\nCould one have looked upon such a scene with indifference, he would\r\nhave been amused at the gravity with which the savages listened to the\r\ntranslation of this unusual request. No taunt, no smile mingled with\r\ntheir surprise, for Hetty had a character and a manner too saintly to\r\nsubject her infirmity to the mockings of the rude and ferocious. On the\r\ncontrary, she was answered with respectful attention.\r\n\r\n"My daughter does not always talk like a chief at a Council Fire,"\r\nreturned Rivenoak, "or she would not have said this. Two of my warriors\r\nhave fallen by the blows of our prisoner; their grave is too small to\r\nhold a third. The Hurons do not like to crowd their dead. If there is\r\nanother spirit about to set out for the far off world, it must not\r\nbe the spirit of a Huron; it must be the spirit of a pale-face. Go,\r\ndaughter, and sit by Sumach, who is in grief; let the Huron warriors\r\nshow how well they can shoot; let the pale-face show how little he cares\r\nfor their bullets."\r\n\r\nHetty\'s mind was unequal to a sustained discussion, and accustomed to\r\ndefer to the directions of her seniors she did as told, seating herself\r\npassively on a log by the side of the Sumach, and averting her face from\r\nthe painful scene that was occurring within the circle.\r\n\r\nThe warriors, as soon as this interruption had ceased, resumed their\r\nplaces, and again prepared to exhibit their skill. As there was a double\r\nobject in view, that of putting the constancy of the captive to the\r\nproof, and that of showing how steady were the hands of the marksmen\r\nunder circumstances of excitement, the distance was small, and, in one\r\nsense, safe. But in diminishing the distance taken by the tormentors,\r\nthe trial to the nerves of the captive was essentially increased. The\r\nface of Deerslayer, indeed, was just removed sufficiently from the ends\r\nof the guns to escape the effects of the flash, and his steady eye\r\nwas enabled to look directly into their muzzles, as it might be, in\r\nanticipation of the fatal messenger that was to issue from each. The\r\ncunning Hurons well knew this fact, and scarce one levelled his piece\r\nwithout first causing it to point as near as possible at the forehead\r\nof the prisoner, in the hope that his fortitude would fail him, and that\r\nthe band would enjoy the triumph of seeing a victim quail under their\r\ningenious cruelty. Nevertheless each of the competitors was still\r\ncareful not to injure, the disgrace of striking prematurely being second\r\nonly to that of failing altogether in attaining the object. Shot\r\nafter shot was made; all the bullets coming in close proximity to the\r\nDeerslayer\'s head, without touching it. Still no one could detect even\r\nthe twitching of a muscle on the part of the captive, or the slightest\r\nwinking of an eye. This indomitable resolution, which so much exceeded\r\neverything of its kind that any present had before witnessed, might\r\nbe referred to three distinct causes. The first was resignation to his\r\nfate, blended with natural steadiness of deportment; for our hero had\r\ncalmly made up his mind that he must die, and preferred this mode to any\r\nother; the second was his great familiarity with this particular weapon,\r\nwhich deprived it of all the terror that is usually connected with the\r\nmere form of the danger; and the third was this familiarity carried out\r\nin practice, to a degree so nice as to enable the intended victim to\r\ntell, within an inch, the precise spot where each bullet must strike,\r\nfor he calculated its range by looking in at the bore of the piece. So\r\nexact was Deerslayer\'s estimation of the line of fire, that his pride of\r\nfeeling finally got the better of his resignation, and when five or six\r\nhad discharged their bullets into the tree, he could not refrain from\r\nexpressing his contempt at their want of hand and eye.\r\n\r\n"You may call this shooting, Mingos!" he exclaimed, "but we\'ve squaws\r\namong the Delawares, and I have known Dutch gals on the Mohawk, that\r\ncould outdo your greatest indivours. Ondo these arms of mine, put a\r\nrifle into my hands, and I\'ll pin the thinnest warlock in your party\r\nto any tree you can show me, and this at a hundred yards--ay, or at two\r\nhundred if the objects can be seen, nineteen shots in twenty; or, for\r\nthat matter twenty in twenty, if the piece is creditable and trusty!"\r\n\r\nA low menacing murmur followed this cool taunt. The ire of the warriors\r\nkindled at listening to such a reproach from one who so far disdained\r\ntheir efforts as to refuse even to wink when a rifle was discharged as\r\nnear his face as could be done without burning it. Rivenoak perceived\r\nthat the moment was critical, and, still retaining his hope of adopting\r\nso noted a hunter into his tribe, the politic old chief interposed in\r\ntime, probably to prevent an immediate resort to that portion of the\r\ntorture which must necessarily have produced death through extreme\r\nbodily suffering, if in no other manner. Moving into the centre of\r\nthe irritated group, he addressed them with his usual wily logic and\r\nplausible manner, at once suppressing the fierce movement that had\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\n"I see how it is," he said. "We have been like the pale-faces when they\r\nfasten their doors at night, out of fear of the red men. They use so\r\nmany bars that the fire comes and burns them before they can get out.\r\nWe have bound the Deerslayer too tight: the thongs keep his limbs from\r\nshaking and his eyes from shutting. Loosen him; let us see what his own\r\nbody is really made of."\r\n\r\nIt is often the case when we are thwarted in a cherished scheme, that\r\nany expedient, however unlikely to succeed, is gladly resorted to in\r\npreference to a total abandonment of the project. So it was with the\r\nHurons. The proposal of the chief found instant favor, and several hands\r\nwere immediately at work, cutting and tearing the ropes of bark from the\r\nbody of our hero. In half a minute Deerslayer stood as free from bonds\r\nas when an hour before he had commenced his flight on the side of the\r\nmountain. Some little time was necessary that he should recover the use\r\nof his limbs, the circulation of the blood having been checked by the\r\ntightness of the ligatures, and this was accorded to him by the politic\r\nRivenoak, under the pretence that his body would be more likely to\r\nsubmit to apprehension if its true tone were restored; though really\r\nwith a view to give time to the fierce passions which had been awakened\r\nin the bosoms of his young men to subside. This ruse succeeded, and\r\nDeerslayer by rubbing his limbs, stamping his feet, and moving about,\r\nsoon regained the circulation, recovering all his physical powers as\r\neffectually as if nothing had occurred to disturb them.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom men think of death in the pride of their health and\r\nstrength. So it was with Deerslayer. Having been helplessly bound and,\r\nas he had every reason to suppose, so lately on the very verge of the\r\nother world, to find himself so unexpectedly liberated, in possession of\r\nhis strength and with a full command of limb, acted on him like a sudden\r\nrestoration to life, reanimating hopes that he had once absolutely\r\nabandoned. From that instant all his plans changed. In this, he simply\r\nobeyed a law of nature; for while we have wished to represent our hero\r\nas being resigned to his fate, it has been far from our intention to\r\nrepresent him as anxious to die. From the instant that his buoyancy of\r\nfeeling revived, his thoughts were keenly bent on the various projects\r\nthat presented themselves as modes of evading the designs of his\r\nenemies, and he again became the quick witted, ingenious and determined\r\nwoodsman, alive to all his own powers and resources. The change was so\r\ngreat that his mind resumed its elasticity, and no longer thinking of\r\nsubmission, it dwelt only on the devices of the sort of warfare in which\r\nhe was engaged.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Deerslayer was released, the band divided itself in a circle\r\naround him, in order to hedge him in, and the desire to break down his\r\nspirit grew in them, precisely as they saw proofs of the difficulty\r\nthere would be in subduing it. The honor of the band was now involved in\r\nthe issue, and even the fair sex lost all its sympathy with suffering in\r\nthe desire to save the reputation of the tribe. The voices of the girls,\r\nsoft and melodious as nature had made them, were heard mingling with\r\nthe menaces of the men, and the wrongs of Sumach suddenly assumed the\r\ncharacter of injuries inflicted on every Huron female. Yielding to this\r\nrising tumult, the men drew back a little, signifying to the females\r\nthat they left the captive, for a time, in their hands, it being a\r\ncommon practice on such occasions for the women to endeavor to throw the\r\nvictim into a rage by their taunts and revilings, and then to turn him\r\nsuddenly over to the men in a state of mind that was little favorable to\r\nresisting the agony of bodily suffering. Nor was this party without the\r\nproper instruments for effecting such a purpose. Sumach had a notoriety\r\nas a scold, and one or two crones, like the She Bear, had come out with\r\nthe party, most probably as the conservators of its decency and moral\r\ndiscipline; such things occurring in savage as well as in civilized\r\nlife. It is unnecessary to repeat all that ferocity and ignorance could\r\ninvent for such a purpose, the only difference between this outbreaking\r\nof feminine anger, and a similar scene among ourselves, consisting in\r\nthe figures of speech and the epithets, the Huron women calling their\r\nprisoner by the names of the lower and least respected animals that were\r\nknown to themselves.\r\n\r\nBut Deerslayer\'s mind was too much occupied to permit him to be\r\ndisturbed by the abuse of excited hags, and their rage necessarily\r\nincreasing with his indifference, as his indifference increased with\r\ntheir rage, the furies soon rendered themselves impotent by their\r\nown excesses. Perceiving that the attempt was a complete failure, the\r\nwarriors interfered to put a stop to this scene, and this so much the\r\nmore because preparations were now seriously making for the commencement\r\nof the real tortures, or that which would put the fortitude of the\r\nsufferer to the test of severe bodily pain. A sudden and unlooked for\r\nannouncement, that proceeded from one of the look-outs, a boy ten\r\nor twelve years old, however, put a momentary check to the whole\r\nproceedings. As this interruption has a close connection with the\r\ndenouement of our story, it shall be given in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "So deem\'st thou--so each mortal deems\r\n    Of that which is from that which seems;\r\n    But other harvest here\r\n    Than that which peasant\'s scythe demands,\r\n    Was gather\'d in by sterner hands,\r\n    With bayonet, blade, and spear."\r\n\r\n    Scott, "The Field of Waterloo," V.i-6.\r\n\r\nIt exceeded Deerslayer\'s power to ascertain what had produced the sudden\r\npause in the movements of his enemies, until the fact was revealed in\r\nthe due course of events. He perceived that much agitation prevailed\r\namong the women in particular, while the warriors rested on their arms\r\nin a sort of dignified expectation. It was plain no alarm was excited,\r\nthough it was not equally apparent that a friendly occurrence produced\r\nthe delay. Rivenoak was evidently apprised of all, and by a gesture of\r\nhis arm he appeared to direct the circle to remain unbroken, and for\r\neach person to await the issue in the situation he or she then occupied.\r\nIt required but a minute or two to bring an explanation of this singular\r\nand mysterious pause, which was soon terminated by the appearance of\r\nJudith on the exterior of the line of bodies, and her ready admission\r\nwithin its circle.\r\n\r\nIf Deerslayer was startled by this unexpected arrival, well knowing\r\nthat the quick witted girl could claim none of that exemption from the\r\npenalties of captivity that was so cheerfully accorded to her feebler\r\nminded sister, he was equally astonished at the guise in which she came.\r\nAll her ordinary forest attire, neat and becoming as this usually was,\r\nhad been laid aside for the brocade that has been already mentioned,\r\nand which had once before wrought so great and magical an effect in\r\nher appearance. Nor was this all. Accustomed to see the ladies of the\r\ngarrison in the formal, gala attire of the day, and familiar with\r\nthe more critical niceties of these matters, the girl had managed to\r\ncomplete her dress in a way to leave nothing strikingly defective in its\r\ndetails, or even to betray an incongruity that would have been detected\r\nby one practised in the mysteries of the toilet. Head, feet, arms,\r\nhands, bust, and drapery, were all in harmony, as female attire was\r\nthen deemed attractive and harmonious, and the end she aimed at, that of\r\nimposing on the uninstructed senses of the savages, by causing them to\r\nbelieve their guest was a woman of rank and importance, might well\r\nhave succeeded with those whose habits had taught them to discriminate\r\nbetween persons. Judith, in addition to her rare native beauty, had a\r\nsingular grace of person, and her mother had imparted enough of her own\r\ndeportment to prevent any striking or offensive vulgarity of manner; so\r\nthat, sooth to say, the gorgeous dress might have been worse bestowed in\r\nnearly every particular. Had it been displayed in a capital, a thousand\r\nmight have worn it, before one could have been found to do more credit\r\nto its gay colours, glossy satins, and rich laces, than the beautiful\r\ncreature whose person it now aided to adorn. The effect of such an\r\napparition had not been miscalculated. The instant Judith found herself\r\nwithin the circle, she was, in a degree, compensated for the fearful\r\npersonal risk she ran, by the unequivocal sensation of surprise and\r\nadmiration produced by her appearance. The grim old warriors uttered\r\ntheir favorite exclamation "hugh!" The younger men were still more\r\nsensibly overcome, and even the women were not backward in letting\r\nopen manifestations of pleasure escape them. It was seldom that these\r\nuntutored children of the forest had ever seen any white female above\r\nthe commonest sort, and, as to dress, never before had so much splendor\r\nshone before their eyes. The gayest uniforms of both French and English\r\nseemed dull compared with the lustre of the brocade, and while the rare\r\npersonal beauty of the wearer added to the effect produced by its hues,\r\nthe attire did not fail to adorn that beauty in a way which surpassed\r\neven the hopes of its wearer. Deerslayer himself was astounded, and this\r\nquite as much by the brilliant picture the girl presented, as at the\r\nindifference to consequences with which she had braved the danger of the\r\nstep she had taken. Under such circumstances, all waited for the\r\nvisitor to explain her object, which to most of the spectators seemed as\r\ninexplicable as her appearance.\r\n\r\n"Which of these warriors is the principal chief?" demanded Judith of\r\nDeerslayer, as soon as she found it was expected that she should open\r\nthe communications; "my errand is too important to be delivered to any\r\nof inferior rank. First explain to the Hurons what I say; then give an\r\nanswer to the question I have put."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer quietly complied, his auditors greedily listening to the\r\ninterpretation of the first words that fell from so extraordinary a\r\nvision. The demand seemed perfectly in character for one who had every\r\nappearance of an exalted rank, herself. Rivenoak gave an appropriate\r\nreply, by presenting himself before his fair visitor in a way to leave\r\nno doubt that he was entitled to all the consideration he claimed.\r\n\r\n"I can believe this, Huron," resumed Judith, enacting her assumed\r\npart with a steadiness and dignity that did credit to her powers of\r\nimitation, for she strove to impart to her manner the condescending\r\ncourtesy she had once observed in the wife of a general officer, at\r\na similar though a more amicable scene: "I can believe you to be the\r\nprincipal person of this party; I see in your countenance the marks of\r\nthought and reflection. To you, then, I must make my communication."\r\n\r\n"Let the Flower of the Woods speak," returned the old chief courteously,\r\nas soon as her address had been translated so that all might understand\r\nit--"If her words are as pleasant as her looks, they will never quit my\r\nears; I shall hear them long after the winter of Canada has killed all\r\nthe flowers, and frozen all the speeches of summer."\r\n\r\nThis admiration was grateful to one constituted like Judith, and\r\ncontributed to aid her self-possession, quite as much as it fed her\r\nvanity. Smiling involuntarily, or in spite of her wish to seem reserved,\r\nshe proceeded in her plot.\r\n\r\n"Now, Huron," she continued, "listen to my words. Your eyes tell you\r\nthat I am no common woman. I will not say I am queen of this country;\r\nshe is afar off, in a distant land; but under our gracious monarchs,\r\nthere are many degrees of rank; one of these I fill. What that rank\r\nis precisely, it is unnecessary for me to say, since you would not\r\nunderstand it. For that information you must trust your eyes. You see\r\nwhat I am; you must feel that in listening to my words, you listen to\r\none who can be your friend, or your enemy, as you treat her."\r\n\r\nThis was well uttered, with a due attention to manner and a steadiness\r\nof tone that was really surprising, considering all the circumstances\r\nof the case. It was well, though simply rendered into the Indian\r\ndialect too, and it was received with a respect and gravity that augured\r\nfavourably for the girl\'s success. But Indian thought is not easily\r\ntraced to its sources. Judith waited with anxiety to hear the answer,\r\nfilled with hope even while she doubted. Rivenoak was a ready speaker,\r\nand he answered as promptly as comported with the notions of Indian\r\ndecorum; that peculiar people seeming to think a short delay respectful,\r\ninasmuch as it manifests that the words already heard have been duly\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n"My daughter is handsomer than the wild roses of Ontario; her voice is\r\npleasant to the ear as the song of the wren," answered the cautious and\r\nwily chief, who of all the band stood alone in not being fully imposed\r\non by the magnificent and unusual appearance of Judith; but who\r\ndistrusted even while he wondered: "the humming bird is not much larger\r\nthan the bee; yet, its feathers are as gay as the tail of the peacock.\r\nThe Great Spirit sometimes puts very bright clothes on very little\r\nanimals. Still He covers the Moose with coarse hair. These things are\r\nbeyond the understanding of poor Indians, who can only comprehend\r\nwhat they see and hear. No doubt my daughter has a very large wigwam\r\nsomewhere about the lake; the Hurons have not found it, on account of\r\ntheir ignorance?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you, chief, that it would be useless to state my rank and\r\nresidence, in as much as you would not comprehend them. You must trust\r\nto your eyes for this knowledge; what red man is there who cannot see?\r\nThis blanket that I wear is not the blanket of a common squaw; these\r\nornaments are such as the wives and daughters of chiefs only appear\r\nin. Now, listen and hear why I have come alone among your people, and\r\nhearken to the errand that has brought me here. The Yengeese have young\r\nmen, as well as the Hurons; and plenty of them, too; this you well\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"The Yengeese are as plenty as the leaves on the trees! This every Huron\r\nknows, and feels."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, chief. Had I brought a party with me, it might\r\nhave caused trouble. My young men and your young men would have looked\r\nangrily at each other; especially had my young men seen that pale-face\r\nbound for the torture. He is a great hunter, and is much loved by all\r\nthe garrisons, far and near. There would have been blows about him, and\r\nthe trail of the Iroquois back to the Canadas would have been marked\r\nwith blood."\r\n\r\n"There is so much blood on it, now," returned the chief, gloomily, "that\r\nit blinds our eyes. My young men see that it is all Huron."\r\n\r\n"No doubt; and more Huron blood would be spilt had I come surrounded\r\nwith pale-faces. I have heard of Rivenoak, and have thought it would be\r\nbetter to send him back in peace to his village, that he might leave his\r\nwomen and children behind him; if he then wished to come for our scalps,\r\nwe would meet him. He loves animals made of ivory, and little rifles.\r\nSee; I have brought some with me to show him. I am his friend. When\r\nhe has packed up these things among his goods, he will start for his\r\nvillage, before any of my young men can overtake him, and then he will\r\nshow his people in Canada what riches they can come to seek, now that\r\nour great fathers, across the Salt Lake, have sent each other the war\r\nhatchet. I will lead back with me this great hunter, of whom I have need\r\nto keep my house in venison."\r\n\r\nJudith, who was sufficiently familiar with Indian phraseology,\r\nendeavored to express her ideas in the sententious manner common to\r\nthose people, and she succeeded even beyond her own expectations.\r\nDeerslayer did her full justice in the translation, and this so much\r\nthe more readily, since the girl carefully abstained from uttering any\r\ndirect untruth; a homage she paid to the young man\'s known aversion to\r\nfalsehood, which he deemed a meanness altogether unworthy of a white\r\nman\'s gifts. The offering of the two remaining elephants, and of the\r\npistols already mentioned, one of which was all the worse for the recent\r\naccident, produced a lively sensation among the Hurons, generally,\r\nthough Rivenoak received it coldly, notwithstanding the delight with\r\nwhich he had first discovered the probable existence of a creature with\r\ntwo tails. In a word, this cool and sagacious savage was not so easily\r\nimposed on as his followers, and with a sentiment of honor that half\r\nthe civilized world would have deemed supererogatory, he declined\r\nthe acceptance of a bribe that he felt no disposition to earn by a\r\ncompliance with the donor\'s wishes.\r\n\r\n"Let my daughter keep her two-tailed hog, to eat when venison is\r\nscarce," he drily answered, "and the little gun, which has two muzzles.\r\nThe Hurons will kill deer when they are hungry, and they have long\r\nrifles to fight with. This hunter cannot quit my young men now; they\r\nwish to know if he is as stouthearted as he boasts himself to be."\r\n\r\n"That I deny, Huron--" interrupted Deerslayer, with warmth--"Yes, that\r\nI downright deny, as ag\'in truth and reason. No man has heard me boast,\r\nand no man shall, though ye flay me alive, and then roast the quivering\r\nflesh, with your own infarnal devices and cruelties! I may be humble,\r\nand misfortunate, and your prisoner; but I\'m no boaster, by my very\r\ngifts."\r\n\r\n"My young pale-face boasts he is no boaster," returned the crafty chief:\r\n"he must be right. I hear a strange bird singing. It has very rich\r\nfeathers. No Huron ever before saw such feathers! They will be ashamed\r\nto go back to their village, and tell their people that they let their\r\nprisoner go on account of the song of this strange bird and not be able\r\nto give the name of the bird. They do not know how to say whether it\r\nis a wren, or a cat bird. This would be a great disgrace; my young men\r\nwould not be allowed to travel in the woods without taking their mothers\r\nwith them, to tell them the names of the birds!"\r\n\r\n"You can ask my name of your prisoner," returned the girl. "It is\r\nJudith; and there is a great deal of the history of Judith in the\r\npale-face\'s best book, the Bible. If I am a bird of fine feathers, I\r\nhave also my name."\r\n\r\n"No," answered the wily Huron, betraying the artifice he had so long\r\npractised, by speaking in English with tolerable accuracy, "I not ask\r\nprisoner. He tired; he want rest. I ask my daughter, with feeble mind.\r\nShe speak truth. Come here, daughter; you answer. Your name, Hetty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what they call me," returned the girl, "though it\'s written\r\nEsther in the Bible."\r\n\r\n"He write him in bible, too! All write in bible. No matter--what her\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s Judith, and it\'s so written in the Bible, though father\r\nsometimes called her Jude. That\'s my sister Judith. Thomas Hutter\'s\r\ndaughter--Thomas Hutter, whom you called the Muskrat; though he was no\r\nmuskrat, but a man like yourselves--he lived in a house on the water,\r\nand that was enough for you."\r\n\r\nA smile of triumph gleamed on the hard wrinkled countenance of the\r\nchief, when he found how completely his appeal to the truth-loving\r\nHetty had succeeded. As for Judith, herself, the moment her sister was\r\nquestioned, she saw that all was lost; for no sign, or even intreaty\r\ncould have induced the right feeling girl to utter a falsehood.\r\nTo attempt to impose a daughter of the Muskrat on the savages as a\r\nprincess, or a great lady, she knew would be idle, and she saw her bold\r\nand ingenious expedient for liberating the captive fail, through one of\r\nthe simplest and most natural causes that could be imagined. She turned\r\nher eye on Deerslayer, therefore, as if imploring him to interfere to\r\nsave them both.\r\n\r\n"It will not do, Judith," said the young man, in answer to this appeal,\r\nwhich he understood, though he saw its uselessness; "it will not do.\r\n\'Twas a bold idea, and fit for a general\'s lady, but yonder\r\nMingo" Rivenoak had withdrawn to a little distance, and was out of\r\nearshot--"but yonder Mingo is an oncommon man, and not to be deceived by\r\nany unnat\'ral sarcumvention. Things must come afore him in their right\r\norder, to draw a cloud afore his eyes! \'Twas too much to attempt making\r\nhim fancy that a queen, or a great lady, lived in these mountains, and\r\nno doubt he thinks the fine clothes you wear is some of the plunder of\r\nyour own father--or, at least, of him who once passed for your father;\r\nas quite likely it was, if all they say is true."\r\n\r\n"At all events, Deerslayer, my presence here will save you for a time.\r\nThey will hardly attempt torturing you before my face!"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Judith? Do you think they will treat a woman of the pale faces\r\nmore tenderly than they treat their own? It\'s true that your sex will\r\nmost likely save you from the torments, but it will not save your\r\nliberty, and may not save your scalp. I wish you had not come, my\r\ngood Judith; it can do no good to me, while it may do great harm to\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"I can share your fate," the girl answered with generous enthusiasm.\r\n"They shall not injure you while I stand by, if in my power to prevent\r\nit--besides--"\r\n\r\n"Besides, what, Judith? What means have you to stop Injin cruelties, or\r\nto avart Injin deviltries?"\r\n\r\n"None, perhaps, Deerslayer," answered the girl, with firmness, "but I\r\ncan suffer with my friends--die with them if necessary."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Judith--suffer you may; but die you will not, until the Lord\'s time\r\nshall come. It\'s little likely that one of your sex and beauty will meet\r\nwith a harder fate than to become the wife of a chief, if, indeed your\r\nwhite inclinations can stoop to match with an Injin. \'Twould have been\r\nbetter had you staid in the Ark, or the castle, but what has been done,\r\nis done. You was about to say something, when you stopped at \'besides\'?"\r\n\r\n"It might not be safe to mention it here, Deerslayer," the girl\r\nhurriedly answered, moving past him carelessly, that she might speak in\r\na lower tone; "half an hour is all in all to us. None of your friends\r\nare idle."\r\n\r\nThe hunter replied merely by a grateful look. Then he turned towards his\r\nenemies, as if ready again to face their torments. A short consultation\r\nhad passed among the elders of the band, and by this time they also were\r\nprepared with their decision. The merciful purpose of Rivenoak had been\r\nmuch weakened by the artifice of Judith, which, failing of its real\r\nobject, was likely to produce results the very opposite of those she had\r\nanticipated. This was natural; the feeling being aided by the resentment\r\nof an Indian who found how near he had been to becoming the dupe of\r\nan inexperienced girl. By this time, Judith\'s real character was fully\r\nunderstood, the wide spread reputation of her beauty contributing to the\r\nexposure. As for the unusual attire, it was confounded with the profound\r\nmystery of the animals with two tails, and for the moment lost its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWhen Rivenoak, therefore, faced the captive again, it was with an\r\naltered countenance. He had abandoned the wish of saving him, and was\r\nno longer disposed to retard the more serious part of the torture. This\r\nchange of sentiment was, in effect, communicated to the young men,\r\nwho were already eagerly engaged in making their preparations for the\r\ncontemplated scene. Fragments of dried wood were rapidly collected near\r\nthe sapling, the splinters which it was intended to thrust into the\r\nflesh of the victim, previously to lighting, were all collected, and the\r\nthongs were already produced that were again to bind him to the tree.\r\nAll this was done in profound silence, Judith watching every movement\r\nwith breathless expectation, while Deerslayer himself stood seemingly as\r\nunmoved as one of the pines of the hills. When the warriors advanced\r\nto bind him, however, the young man glanced at Judith, as if to enquire\r\nwhether resistance or submission were most advisable. By a significant\r\ngesture she counselled the last, and, in a minute, he was once more\r\nfastened to the tree, a helpless object of any insult, or wrong, that\r\nmight be offered. So eagerly did every one now act, that nothing was\r\nsaid. The fire was immediately lighted in the pile, and the end of all\r\nwas anxiously expected.\r\n\r\nIt was not the intention of the Hurons absolutely to destroy the life of\r\ntheir victim by means of fire. They designed merely to put his physical\r\nfortitude to the severest proofs it could endure, short of that\r\nextremity. In the end, they fully intended to carry his scalp with\r\nthem into their village, but it was their wish first to break down his\r\nresolution, and to reduce him to the level of a complaining sufferer.\r\nWith this view, the pile of brush and branches had been placed at a\r\nproper distance, or, one at which it was thought the heat would soon\r\nbecome intolerable, though it might not be immediately dangerous. As\r\noften happened, however, on these occasions, this distance had been\r\nmiscalculated, and the flames began to wave their forked tongues in a\r\nproximity to the face of the victim, that would have proved fatal, in\r\nanother instant, had not Hetty rushed through the crowd, armed with a\r\nstick, and scattered the blazing pile in a dozen directions. More than\r\none hand was raised to strike this presumptuous intruder to the earth,\r\nbut the chiefs prevented the blows, by reminding their irritated\r\nfollowers of the state of her mind. Hetty, herself, was insensible to\r\nthe risk she ran, but, as soon as she had performed this bold act, she\r\nstood looking about her, in frowning resentment, as if to rebuke the\r\ncrowd of attentive savages for their cruelty.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, dearest sister, for that brave and ready act!"\r\nmurmured Judith, herself unnerved so much as to be incapable of\r\nexertion--"Heaven, itself, has sent you on its holy errand."\r\n\r\n"\'Twas well meant, Judith--" rejoined the victim--"\'twas excellently\r\nmeant, and \'twas timely; though it may prove ontimely in the ind! What\r\nis to come to pass, must come to pass soon, or \'twill quickly be too\r\nlate. Had I drawn in one mouthful of that flame in breathing, the power\r\nof man could not save my life, and you see that, this time, they\'ve so\r\nbound my forehead, as not to leave my head the smallest chance. \'Twas\r\nwell meant, but it might have been more marciful to let the flames act\r\ntheir part."\r\n\r\n"Cruel, heartless Hurons!" exclaimed the still indignant Hetty--"Would\r\nyou burn a man and a Christian, as you would burn a log of wood! Do you\r\nnever read your Bibles? Or do you think God will forget such things?"\r\n\r\nA gesture from Rivenoak caused the scattered brands to be collected.\r\nFresh wood was brought, even the women and children busying themselves\r\neagerly, in the gathering of dried sticks. The flame was just kindling\r\na second time, when an Indian female pushed through the circle, advanced\r\nto the heap, and with her foot dashed aside the lighted twigs in time to\r\nprevent the conflagration. A yell followed this second disappointment,\r\nbut when the offender turned towards the circle, and presented the\r\ncountenance of Hist, it was succeeded by a common exclamation of\r\npleasure and surprise. For a minute, all thought of pursuing the\r\nbusiness in hand was forgotten. Young and old crowded around the girl,\r\nin haste to demand an explanation of her sudden and unlooked-for return.\r\nIt was at this critical instant that Hist spoke to Judith in a low\r\nvoice, placed some small object unseen in her hand, and then turned to\r\nmeet the salutations of the Huron girls, with whom she was personally\r\na great favorite. Judith recovered her self possession, and acted\r\npromptly. The small, keen edged knife that Hist had given to the other,\r\nwas passed by the latter into the hands of Hetty, as the safest and\r\nleast suspected medium of transferring it to Deerslayer. But the feeble\r\nintellect of the last defeated the well-grounded hopes of all three.\r\nInstead of first cutting loose the hands of the victim, and then\r\nconcealing the knife in his clothes, in readiness for action at the\r\nmost available instant, she went to work herself, with earnestness and\r\nsimplicity, to cut the thongs that bound his head, that he might\r\nnot again be in danger of inhaling flames. Of course this deliberate\r\nprocedure was seen, and the hands of Hetty were arrested, ere she\r\nhad more than liberated the upper portion of the captive\'s body, not\r\nincluding his arms below the elbows. This discovery at once pointed\r\ndistrust towards Hist, and to Judith\'s surprise, when questioned on the\r\nsubject, that spirited girl was not disposed to deny her agency in what\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n"Why should I not help the Deerslayer?" the girl demanded, in the tones\r\nof a firm minded woman. "He is the brother of a Delaware chief; my heart\r\nis all Delaware. Come forth, miserable Briarthorn, and wash the Iroquois\r\npaint from your face; stand before the Hurons the crow that you are. You\r\nwould eat the carrion of your own dead, rather than starve. Put him face\r\nto face with Deerslayer, chiefs and warriors; I will show you how great\r\na knave you have been keeping in your tribe."\r\n\r\nThis bold language, uttered in their own dialect and with a manner full\r\nof confidence, produced a deep sensation among the Hurons. Treachery\r\nis always liable to distrust, and though the recreant Briarthorn had\r\nendeavoured to serve the enemy well, his exertions and assiduities had\r\ngained for him little more than toleration. His wish to obtain Hist\r\nfor a wife had first induced him to betray her, and his own people, but\r\nserious rivals to his first project had risen up among his new\r\nfriends, weakening still more their sympathies with treason. In a word,\r\nBriarthorn had been barely permitted to remain in the Huron encampment,\r\nwhere he was as closely and as jealously watched as Hist, herself,\r\nseldom appearing before the chiefs, and sedulously keeping out of\r\nview of Deerslayer, who, until this moment, was ignorant even of his\r\npresence. Thus summoned, however, it was impossible to remain in the\r\nback ground. "Wash the Iroquois paint from his face," he did not, for\r\nwhen he stood in the centre of the circle, he was so disguised in these\r\nnew colours, that at first, the hunter did not recognise him. He assumed\r\nan air of defiance, notwithstanding, and haughtily demanded what any\r\ncould say against "Briarthorn."\r\n\r\n"Ask yourself that," continued Hist with spirit, though her manner grew\r\nless concentrated, and there was a slight air of abstraction that became\r\nobservable to Deerslayer and Judith, if to no others--"Ask that of your\r\nown heart, sneaking woodchuck of the Delawares; come not here with the\r\nface of an innocent man. Go look into the spring; see the colours of\r\nyour enemies on your lying skin; then come back and boast how you run\r\nfrom your tribe and took the blanket of the French for your covering!\r\nPaint yourself as bright as the humming bird, you will still be black as\r\nthe crow!"\r\n\r\nHist had been so uniformly gentle, while living with the Hurons, that\r\nthey now listened to her language with surprise. As for the delinquent,\r\nhis blood boiled in his veins, and it was well for the pretty speaker\r\nthat it was not in his power to execute the revenge he burned to inflict\r\non her, in spite of his pretended love.\r\n\r\n"Who wishes Briarthorn?" he sternly asked--"If this pale-face is tired\r\nof life, if afraid of Indian torments, speak, Rivenoak; I will send him\r\nafter the warriors we have lost."\r\n\r\n"No, chiefs--no, Rivenoak--" eagerly interrupted Hist--"Deerslayer fears\r\nnothing; least of all a crow! Unbind him--cut his withes, place him face\r\nto face with this cawing bird; then let us see which is tired of life!"\r\n\r\nHist made a forward movement, as if to take a knife from a young man,\r\nand perform the office she had mentioned in person, but an aged warrior\r\ninterposed, at a sign from Rivenoak. This chief watched all the girl did\r\nwith distrust, for, even while speaking in her most boastful language,\r\nand in the steadiest manner, there was an air of uncertainty and\r\nexpectation about her, that could not escape so close an observer. She\r\nacted well; but two or three of the old men were equally satisfied that\r\nit was merely acting. Her proposal to release Deerslayer, therefore, was\r\nrejected, and the disappointed Hist found herself driven back from the\r\nsapling, at the very moment she fancied herself about to be successful.\r\nAt the same time, the circle, which had got to be crowded and confused,\r\nwas enlarged, and brought once more into order. Rivenoak now announced\r\nthe intention of the old men again to proceed, the delay having\r\ncontinued long enough, and leading to no result.\r\n\r\n"Stop Huron--stay chiefs!--" exclaimed Judith, scarce knowing what she\r\nsaid, or why she interposed, unless to obtain time. "For God\'s sake, a\r\nsingle minute longer--"\r\n\r\nThe words were cut short, by another and a still more extraordinary\r\ninterruption. A young Indian came bounding through the Huron ranks,\r\nleaping into the very centre of the circle, in a way to denote the\r\nutmost confidence, or a temerity bordering on foolhardiness. Five or six\r\nsentinels were still watching the lake at different and distant points,\r\nand it was the first impression of Rivenoak that one of these had come\r\nin, with tidings of import. Still the movements of the stranger were so\r\nrapid, and his war dress, which scarcely left him more drapery than\r\nan antique statue, had so little distinguishing about it, that, at the\r\nfirst moment, it was impossible to ascertain whether he were friend or\r\nfoe. Three leaps carried this warrior to the side of Deerslayer,\r\nwhose withes were cut in the twinkling of an eye, with a quickness and\r\nprecision that left the prisoner perfect master of his limbs. Not till\r\nthis was effected did the stranger bestow a glance on any other object;\r\nthen he turned and showed the astonished Hurons the noble brow, fine\r\nperson, and eagle eye, of a young warrior, in the paint and panoply of a\r\nDelaware. He held a rifle in each hand, the butts of both resting on\r\nthe earth, while from one dangled its proper pouch and horn. This was\r\nKilldeer which, even as he looked boldly and in defiance at the crowd\r\naround him, he suffered to fall back into the hands of its proper owner.\r\nThe presence of two armed men, though it was in their midst, startled\r\nthe Hurons. Their rifles were scattered about against the different\r\ntrees, and their only weapons were their knives and tomahawks. Still\r\nthey had too much self-possession to betray fear. It was little likely\r\nthat so small a force would assail so strong a band, and each man\r\nexpected some extraordinary proposition to succeed so decisive a step.\r\nThe stranger did not seem disposed to disappoint them; he prepared to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"Hurons," he said, "this earth is very big. The Great Lakes are big,\r\ntoo; there is room beyond them for the Iroquois; there is room for the\r\nDelawares on this side. I am Chingachgook the Son of Uncas; the kinsman\r\nof Tamenund. This is my betrothed; that pale-face is my friend. My heart\r\nwas heavy, when I missed him; I followed him to your camp, to see that\r\nno harm happened to him. All the Delaware girls are waiting for Wah;\r\nthey wonder that she stays away so long. Come, let us say farewell, and\r\ngo on our path."\r\n\r\n"Hurons, this is your mortal enemy, the Great Serpent of them you hate!"\r\ncried Briarthorn. "If he escape, blood will be in your moccasin prints,\r\nfrom this spot to the Canadas. I am all Huron!" As the last words were\r\nuttered, the traitor cast his knife at the naked breast of the Delaware.\r\nA quick movement of the arm, on the part of Hist, who stood near, turned\r\naside the blow, the dangerous weapon burying its point in a pine. At the\r\nnext instant, a similar weapon glanced from the hand of the Serpent, and\r\nquivered in the recreant\'s heart. A minute had scarcely elapsed from the\r\nmoment in which Chingachgook bounded into the circle, and that in which\r\nBriarthorn fell, like a log, dead in his tracks. The rapidity of events\r\nhad prevented the Hurons from acting; but this catastrophe permitted no\r\nfarther delay. A common exclamation followed, and the whole party was\r\nin motion. At this instant a sound unusual to the woods was heard, and\r\nevery Huron, male and female, paused to listen, with ears erect and\r\nfaces filled with expectation. The sound was regular and heavy, as if\r\nthe earth were struck with beetles. Objects became visible among the\r\ntrees of the background, and a body of troops was seen advancing with\r\nmeasured tread. They came upon the charge, the scarlet of the King\'s\r\nlivery shining among the bright green foliage of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe scene that followed is not easily described. It was one in which\r\nwild confusion, despair, and frenzied efforts, were so blended as to\r\ndestroy the unity and distinctness of the action. A general yell burst\r\nfrom the enclosed Hurons; it was succeeded by the hearty cheers of\r\nEngland. Still not a musket or rifle was fired, though that steady,\r\nmeasured tramp continued, and the bayonet was seen gleaming in advance\r\nof a line that counted nearly sixty men. The Hurons were taken at\r\na fearful disadvantage. On three sides was the water, while their\r\nformidable and trained foes cut them off from flight on the fourth. Each\r\nwarrior rushed for his arms, and then all on the point, man, woman and\r\nchild, eagerly sought the covers. In this scene of confusion and\r\ndismay, however, nothing could surpass the discretion and coolness of\r\nDeerslayer. His first care was to place Judith and Hist behind trees,\r\nand he looked for Hetty; but she had been hurried away in the crowd of\r\nHuron women. This effected, he threw himself on a flank of the retiring\r\nHurons, who were inclining off towards the southern margin of the\r\npoint, in the hope of escaping through the water. Deerslayer watched his\r\nopportunity, and finding two of his recent tormentors in a range, his\r\nrifle first broke the silence of the terrific scene. The bullet brought\r\ndown both at one discharge. This drew a general fire from the Hurons,\r\nand the rifle and war cry of the Serpent were heard in the clamor. Still\r\nthe trained men returned no answering volley, the whoop and piece of\r\nHurry alone being heard on their side, if we except the short, prompt\r\nword of authority, and that heavy, measured and menacing tread.\r\nPresently, however, the shrieks, groans, and denunciations that usually\r\naccompany the use of the bayonet followed. That terrible and deadly\r\nweapon was glutted in vengeance. The scene that succeeded was one of\r\nthose of which so many have occurred in our own times, in which neither\r\nage nor sex forms an exemption to the lot of a savage warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "The flower that smiles to-day\r\n    To-morrow dies;\r\n    All that we wish to stay,\r\n    Tempts and then flies:\r\n    What is this world\'s delight?\r\n    Lightning that mocks the night,\r\n    Brief even as bright."\r\n\r\n    Shelley, "Mutability," II.  i-v.\r\n\r\nThe picture next presented, by the point of land that the unfortunate\r\nHurons had selected for their last place of encampment, need scarcely be\r\nlaid before the eyes of the reader. Happily for the more tender-minded\r\nand the more timid, the trunks of the trees, the leaves, and the smoke\r\nhad concealed much of that which passed, and night shortly after drew\r\nits veil over the lake, and the whole of that seemingly interminable\r\nwilderness; which may be said to have then stretched, with few and\r\nimmaterial interruptions, from the banks of the Hudson to the shores of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. Our business carries us into the following day, when\r\nlight returned upon the earth, as sunny and as smiling as if nothing\r\nextraordinary had occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose on the following morning, every sign of hostility and\r\nalarm had vanished from the basin of the Glimmerglass. The frightful\r\nevent of the preceding evening had left no impression on the placid\r\nsheet, and the untiring hours pursued their course in the placid order\r\nprescribed by the powerful hand that set them in motion. The birds were\r\nagain skimming the water, or were seen poised on the wing, high above\r\nthe tops of the tallest pines of the mountains, ready to make their\r\nswoops, in obedience to the irresistable law of their natures. In\r\na word, nothing was changed, but the air of movement and life that\r\nprevailed in and around the castle. Here, indeed, was an alteration that\r\nmust have struck the least observant eye. A sentinel, who wore the light\r\ninfantry uniform of a royal regiment, paced the platform with measured\r\ntread, and some twenty more of the same corps lounged about the place,\r\nor were seated in the ark. Their arms were stacked under the eye of\r\ntheir comrade on post. Two officers stood examining the shore, with the\r\nship\'s glass so often mentioned. Their looks were directed to that\r\nfatal point, where scarlet coats were still to be seen gliding among\r\nthe trees, and where the magnifying power of the instrument also showed\r\nspades at work, and the sad duty of interment going on. Several of the\r\ncommon men bore proofs on their persons that their enemies had not\r\nbeen overcome entirely without resistance, and the youngest of the two\r\nofficers on the platform wore an arm in a sling. His companion, who\r\ncommanded the party, had been more fortunate. He it was who used the\r\nglass, in making the reconnoissances in which the two were engaged.\r\n\r\nA sergeant approached to make a report. He addressed the senior of these\r\nofficers as Capt. Warley, while the other was alluded to as Mr., which\r\nwas equivalent to Ensign Thornton. The former it will at once be seen\r\nwas the officer who had been named with so much feeling in the parting\r\ndialogue between Judith and Hurry. He was, in truth, the very individual\r\nwith whom the scandal of the garrisons had most freely connected the\r\nname of this beautiful but indiscreet girl. He was a hard featured, red\r\nfaced man of about five and thirty; but of a military carriage, and with\r\nan air of fashion that might easily impose on the imagination of one as\r\nignorant of the world as Judith.\r\n\r\n"Craig is covering us with benedictions," observed this person to his\r\nyoung ensign, with an air of indifference, as he shut the glass and\r\nhanded it to his servant; "to say the truth, not without reason; it is\r\ncertainly more agreeable to be here in attendance on Miss Judith Hutter,\r\nthan to be burying Indians on a point of the lake, however romantic the\r\nposition, or brilliant the victory. By the way, Wright--is Davis still\r\nliving?"\r\n\r\n"He died about ten minutes since, your honor," returned the sergeant to\r\nwhom this question was addressed. "I knew how it would be, as soon as I\r\nfound the bullet had touched the stomach. I never knew a man who could\r\nhold out long, if he had a hole in his stomach."\r\n\r\n"No; it is rather inconvenient for carrying away any thing very\r\nnourishing," observed Warley, gaping. "This being up two nights de\r\nsuite, Arthur, plays the devil with a man\'s faculties! I\'m as stupid\r\nas one of those Dutch parsons on the Mohawk--I hope your arm is not\r\npainful, my dear boy?"\r\n\r\n"It draws a few grimaces from me, sir, as I suppose you see," answered\r\nthe youth, laughing at the very moment his countenance was a little\r\nawry with pain. "But it may be borne. I suppose Graham can spare a few\r\nminutes, soon, to look at my hurt."\r\n\r\n"She is a lovely creature, this Judith Hutter, after all, Thornton; and\r\nit shall not be my fault if she is not seen and admired in the Parks!"\r\nresumed Warley, who thought little of his companion\'s wound--"your arm,\r\neh! Quite True--Go into the ark, sergeant, and tell Dr. Graham I desire\r\nhe would look at Mr. Thornton\'s injury, as soon as he has done with the\r\npoor fellow with the broken leg. A lovely creature! and she looked like\r\na queen in that brocade dress in which we met her. I find all changed\r\nhere; father and mother both gone, the sister dying, if not dead,\r\nand none of the family left, but the beauty! This has been a lucky\r\nexpedition all round, and promises to terminate better than Indian\r\nskirmishes in general."\r\n\r\n"Am I to suppose, sir, that you are about to desert your colours, in the\r\ngreat corps of bachelors, and close the campaign with matrimony?"\r\n\r\n"I, Tom Warley, turn Benedict! Faith, my dear boy, you little know the\r\ncorps you speak of, if you fancy any such thing. I do suppose there are\r\nwomen in the colonies that a captain of Light Infantry need not disdain;\r\nbut they are not to be found up here, on a mountain lake; or even\r\ndown on the Dutch river where we are posted. It is true, my uncle, the\r\ngeneral, once did me the favor to choose a wife for me in Yorkshire;\r\nbut she had no beauty--and I would not marry a princess, unless she were\r\nhandsome."\r\n\r\n"If handsome, you would marry a beggar?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, these are the notions of an ensign! Love in a cottage--doors--and\r\nwindows--the old story, for the hundredth time. The 20th--don\'t marry.\r\nWe are not a marrying corps, my dear boy. There\'s the Colonel, Old Sir\r\nEdwin-----, now; though a full General he has never thought of a wife;\r\nand when a man gets as high as a Lieutenant General, without matrimony,\r\nhe is pretty safe. Then the Lieutenant Colonel is confirmed, as I tell\r\nmy cousin the bishop. The Major is a widower, having tried matrimony\r\nfor twelve months in his youth, and we look upon him, now, as one of our\r\nmost certain men. Out of ten captains, but one is in the dilemma, and\r\nhe, poor devil, is always kept at regimental headquarters, as a sort of\r\nmemento mori, to the young men as they join. As for the subalterns, not\r\none has ever yet had the audacity to speak of introducing a wife into\r\nthe regiment. But your arm is troublesome, and we\'ll go ourselves and\r\nsee what has become of Graham."\r\n\r\nThe surgeon who had accompanied the party was employed very differently\r\nfrom what the captain supposed. When the assault was over, and the dead\r\nand wounded were collected, poor Hetty had been found among the latter.\r\nA rifle bullet had passed through her body, inflicting an injury that\r\nwas known at a glance to be mortal. How this wound was received, no one\r\nknew; it was probably one of those casualties that ever accompany scenes\r\nlike that related in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Sumach, all the elderly women, and some of the Huron girls, had\r\nfallen by the bayonet, either in the confusion of the melee, or from\r\nthe difficulty of distinguishing the sexes when the dress was so simple.\r\nMuch the greater portion of the warriors suffered on the spot. A few had\r\nescaped, however, and two or three had been taken unharmed. As for\r\nthe wounded, the bayonet saved the surgeon much trouble. Rivenoak had\r\nescaped with life and limb, but was injured and a prisoner. As Captain\r\nWarley and his ensign went into the Ark they passed him, seated in\r\ndignified silence in one end of the scow, his head and leg bound, but\r\nbetraying no visible sign of despondency or despair. That he mourned\r\nthe loss of his tribe is certain; still he did it in a manner that best\r\nbecame a warrior and a chief.\r\n\r\nThe two soldiers found their surgeon in the principal room of the\r\nArk. He was just quitting the pallet of Hetty, with an expression of\r\nsorrowful regret on his hard, pock-marked Scottish features, that it was\r\nnot usual to see there. All his assiduity had been useless, and he was\r\ncompelled reluctantly to abandon the expectation of seeing the girl\r\nsurvive many hours. Dr. Graham was accustomed to death-bed scenes,\r\nand ordinarily they produced but little impression on him. In all that\r\nrelates to religion, his was one of those minds which, in consequence\r\nof reasoning much on material things, logically and consecutively, and\r\noverlooking the total want of premises which such a theory must ever\r\npossess, through its want of a primary agent, had become sceptical;\r\nleaving a vague opinion concerning the origin of things, that, with\r\nhigh pretentions to philosophy, failed in the first of all philosophical\r\nprinciples, a cause. To him religious dependence appeared a weakness,\r\nbut when he found one gentle and young like Hetty, with a mind beneath\r\nthe level of her race, sustained at such a moment by these pious\r\nsentiments, and that, too, in a way that many a sturdy warrior and\r\nreputed hero might have looked upon with envy, he found himself affected\r\nby the sight to a degree that he would have been ashamed to confess.\r\nEdinburgh and Aberdeen, then as now, supplied no small portion of the\r\nmedical men of the British service, and Dr. Graham, as indeed his name\r\nand countenance equally indicated, was, by birth a North Briton.\r\n\r\n"Here is an extraordinary exhibition for a forest, and one but\r\nhalf-gifted with reason," he observed with a decided Scotch accent, as\r\nWarley and the ensign entered; "I just hope, gentlemen, that when we\r\nthree shall be called on to quit the 20th, we may be found as resigned\r\nto go on the half pay of another existence, as this poor demented\r\nchiel!"\r\n\r\n"Is there no hope that she can survive the hurt?" demanded Warley,\r\nturning his eyes towards the pallid Judith, on whose cheeks, however,\r\ntwo large spots of red had settled as soon as he came into the cabin.\r\n\r\n"No more than there is for Chairlie Stuart! Approach and judge for\r\nyourselves, gentlemen; ye\'ll see faith exemplified in an exceeding and\r\nwonderful manner. There is a sort of arbitrium between life and\r\ndeath, in actual conflict in the poor girl\'s mind, that renders her an\r\ninteresting study to a philosopher. Mr. Thornton, I\'m at your service,\r\nnow; we can just look at the arm in the next room, while we speculate as\r\nmuch as we please on the operations and sinuosities of the human mind."\r\n\r\nThe surgeon and ensign retired, and Warley had an opportunity of looking\r\nabout him more at leisure, and with a better understanding of the nature\r\nand feelings of the group collected in the cabin. Poor Hetty had\r\nbeen placed on her own simple bed, and was reclining in a half seated\r\nattitude, with the approaches of death on her countenance, though they\r\nwere singularly dimmed by the lustre of an expression in which all the\r\nintelligence of her entire being appeared to be concentrated. Judith\r\nand Hist were near her, the former seated in deep grief; the latter\r\nstanding, in readiness to offer any of the gentle attentions of feminine\r\ncare. Deerslayer stood at the end of the pallet, leaning on Killdeer,\r\nunharmed in person, all the fine martial ardor that had so lately glowed\r\nin his countenance having given place to the usual look of honesty and\r\nbenevolence, qualities of which the expression was now softened by\r\nmanly regret and pity. The Serpent was in the background of the picture,\r\nerect, and motionless as a statue; but so observant that not a look of\r\nthe eye escaped his own keen glances. Hurry completed the group, being\r\nseated on a stool near the door, like one who felt himself out of place\r\nin such a scene, but who was ashamed to quit it, unbidden.\r\n\r\n"Who is that in scarlet?" asked Hetty, as soon as the Captain\'s uniform\r\ncaught her eye. "Tell me, Judith, is it the friend of Hurry?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis the officer who commands the troops that have rescued us all from\r\nthe hands of the Hurons," was the low answer of the sister.\r\n\r\n"Am I rescued, too!--I thought they said I was shot, and about to die.\r\nMother is dead; and so is father; but you are living, Judith, and so\r\nis Hurry. I was afraid Hurry would be killed, when I heard him shouting\r\namong the soldiers."\r\n\r\n"Never mind--never mind, dear Hetty--" interrupted Judith, sensitively\r\nalive to the preservation of her sister\'s secret, more, perhaps, at such\r\na moment, than at any other. "Hurry is well, and Deerslayer is well, and\r\nthe Delaware is well, too."\r\n\r\n"How came they to shoot a poor girl like me, and let so many men go\r\nunharmed? I didn\'t know that the Hurons were so wicked, Judith!"\r\n\r\n"\'Twas an accident, poor Hetty; a sad accident it has been! No one would\r\nwillingly have injured you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of that!--I thought it strange; I am feeble minded, and the\r\nredmen have never harmed me before. I should be sorry to think that they\r\nhad changed their minds. I am glad too, Judith, that they haven\'t hurt\r\nHurry. Deerslayer I don\'t think God will suffer any one to harm. It\r\nwas very fortunate the soldiers came as they did though, for fire will\r\nburn!"\r\n\r\n"It was indeed fortunate, my sister; God\'s holy name be forever blessed\r\nfor the mercy!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say, Judith, you know some of the officers; you used to know so\r\nmany!"\r\n\r\nJudith made no reply; she hid her face in her hands and groaned. Hetty\r\ngazed at her in wonder; but naturally supposing her own situation was\r\nthe cause of this grief, she kindly offered to console her sister.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind me, dear Judith," said the affectionate and pure-hearted\r\ncreature, "I don\'t suffer; if I do die, why father and mother are both\r\ndead, and what happens to them may well happen to me. You know I am\r\nof less account than any of the family; therefore few will think of me\r\nafter I\'m in the lake."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no--poor, dear, dear Hetty!" exclaimed Judith, in an\r\nuncontrollable burst of sorrow, "I, at least, will ever think of you;\r\nand gladly, oh! how gladly would I exchange places with you, to be the\r\npure, excellent, sinless creature you are!"\r\n\r\nUntil now, Captain Warley had stood leaning against the door of the\r\ncabin; when this outbreak of feeling, and perchance of penitence,\r\nhowever, escaped the beautiful girl, he walked slowly and thoughtfully\r\naway; even passing the ensign, then suffering under the surgeon\'s care,\r\nwithout noticing him.\r\n\r\n"I have got my Bible here, Judith," returned her sister in a voice of\r\ntriumph. "It\'s true, I can\'t read any longer, there\'s something the\r\nmatter with my eyes--you look dim and distant--and so does Hurry, now\r\nI look at him--well, I never could have believed that Henry March would\r\nhave so dull a look! What can be the reason, Judith, that I see so\r\nbadly, to-day? I, who mother always said had the best eyes in the\r\nwhole family. Yes, that was it: my mind was feeble--what people call\r\nhalf-witted--but my eyes were so good!"\r\n\r\nAgain Judith groaned; this time no feeling of self, no retrospect of\r\nthe past caused the pain. It was the pure, heartfelt sorrow of sisterly\r\nlove, heightened by a sense of the meek humility and perfect truth of\r\nthe being before her. At that moment, she would gladly have given up\r\nher own life to save that of Hetty. As the last, however, was beyond the\r\nreach of human power, she felt there was nothing left her but sorrow. At\r\nthis moment Warley returned to the cabin, drawn by a secret impulse he\r\ncould not withstand, though he felt, just then, as if he would gladly\r\nabandon the American continent forever, were it practicable. Instead of\r\npausing at the door, he now advanced so near the pallet of the sufferer\r\nas to come more plainly within her gaze. Hetty could still distinguish\r\nlarge objects, and her look soon fastened on him.\r\n\r\n"Are you the officer that came with Hurry?" she asked. "If you are, we\r\nought all to thank you, for, though I am hurt, the rest have saved their\r\nlives. Did Harry March tell you, where to find us, and how much need\r\nthere was for your services?"\r\n\r\n"The news of the party reached us by means of a friendly runner,"\r\nreturned the Captain, glad to relieve his feelings by this appearance of\r\na friendly communication, "and I was immediately sent out to cut it off.\r\nIt was fortunate, certainly, that we met Hurry Harry, as you call him,\r\nfor he acted as a guide, and it was not less fortunate that we heard a\r\nfiring, which I now understand was merely a shooting at the mark, for\r\nit not only quickened our march, but called us to the right side of the\r\nlake. The Delaware saw us on the shore, with the glass it would seem,\r\nand he and Hist, as I find his squaw is named, did us excellent service.\r\nIt was really altogether a fortunate concurrence of circumstances,\r\nJudith."\r\n\r\n"Talk not to me of any thing fortunate, sir," returned the girl huskily,\r\nagain concealing her face. "To me the world is full of misery. I wish\r\nnever to hear of marks, or rifles, or soldiers, or men, again!"\r\n\r\n"Do you know my sister?" asked Hetty, ere the rebuked soldier had time\r\nto rally for an answer. "How came you to know that her name is Judith?\r\nYou are right, for that is her name; and I am Hetty; Thomas Hutter\'s\r\ndaughters."\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, dearest sister; for my sake, beloved Hetty,"\r\ninterposed Judith, imploringly, "say no more of this!"\r\n\r\nHetty looked surprised, but accustomed to comply, she ceased her awkward\r\nand painful interrogations of Warley, bending her eyes towards the Bible\r\nwhich she still held between her hands, as one would cling to a casket\r\nof precious stones in a shipwreck, or a conflagration. Her mind now\r\nadverted to the future, losing sight, in a great measure, of the scenes\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\n"We shall not long be parted, Judith," she said; "when you die, you must\r\nbe brought and be buried in the lake, by the side of mother, too."\r\n\r\n"Would to God, Hetty, that I lay there at this moment!"\r\n\r\n"No, that cannot be, Judith; people must die before they have any\r\nright to be buried. \'Twould be wicked to bury you, or for you to bury\r\nyourself, while living. Once I thought of burying myself; God kept me\r\nfrom that sin."\r\n\r\n"You!--You, Hetty Hutter, think of such an act!" exclaimed Judith,\r\nlooking up in uncontrollable surprise, for she well knew nothing passed\r\nthe lips of her conscientious sister, that was not religiously true.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did, Judith, but God has forgotten--no he forgets nothing--but\r\nhe has forgiven it," returned the dying girl, with the subdued manner\r\nof a repentant child. "\'Twas after mother\'s death; I felt I had lost the\r\nbest friend I had on earth, if not the only friend. \'Tis true, you and\r\nfather were kind to me, Judith, but I was so feeble-minded, I knew I\r\nshould only give you trouble; and then you were so often ashamed of such\r\na sister and daughter, and \'tis hard to live in a world where all look\r\nupon you as below them. I thought then, if I could bury myself by the\r\nside of mother, I should be happier in the lake than in the hut."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me--pardon me, dearest Hetty--on my bended knees, I beg you\r\nto pardon me, sweet sister, if any word, or act of mine drove you to so\r\nmaddening and cruel a thought!"\r\n\r\n"Get up, Judith--kneel to God; don\'t kneel to me. Just so I felt when\r\nmother was dying! I remembered everything I had said and done to vex\r\nher, and could have kissed her feet for forgiveness. I think it must be\r\nso with all dying people; though, now I think of it, I don\'t remember to\r\nhave had such feelings on account of father."\r\n\r\nJudith arose, hid her face in her apron, and wept. A long pause--one of\r\nmore than two hours--succeeded, during which Warley entered and left the\r\ncabin several times; apparently uneasy when absent, and yet unable to\r\nremain. He issued various orders, which his men proceeded to execute,\r\nand there was an air of movement in the party, more especially as Mr.\r\nCraig, the lieutenant, had got through the unpleasant duty of burying\r\nthe dead, and had sent for instructions from the shore, desiring to know\r\nwhat he was to do with his detachment. During this interval Hetty\r\nslept a little, and Deerslayer and Chingachgook left the Ark to confer\r\ntogether. But, at the end of the time mentioned, the Surgeon passed upon\r\nthe platform, and with a degree of feeling his comrades had never before\r\nobserved in one of his habits, he announced that the patient was rapidly\r\ndrawing near her end. On receiving this intelligence the group collected\r\nagain, curiosity to witness such a death--or a better feeling--drawing\r\nto the spot men who had so lately been actors in a scene seemingly of\r\nso much greater interest and moment. By this time Judith had got to be\r\ninactive through grief, and Hist alone was performing the little offices\r\nof feminine attention that are so appropriate to the sick bed. Hetty\r\nherself had undergone no other apparent change than the general failing\r\nthat indicated the near approach of dissolution. All that she possessed\r\nof mind was as clear as ever, and, in some respects, her intellect\r\nperhaps was more than usually active.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t grieve for me so much, Judith," said the gentle sufferer, after\r\na pause in her remarks; "I shall soon see mother--I think I see her now;\r\nher face is just as sweet and smiling as it used to be! Perhaps when I\'m\r\ndead, God will give me all my mind, and I shall become a more fitting\r\ncompanion for mother than I ever was before."\r\n\r\n"You will be an angel in heaven, Hetty," sobbed the sister; "no spirit\r\nthere will be more worthy of its holy residence!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it quite; still, I know it must be all true; I\'ve\r\nread it in the Bible. How dark it\'s becoming! Can it be night so soon? I\r\ncan hardly see you at all--where is Hist?"\r\n\r\n"I here, poor girl--Why you no see me?"\r\n\r\n"I do see you; but I couldn\'t tell whether \'twas you, or Judith. I\r\nbelieve I shan\'t see you much longer, Hist."\r\n\r\n"Sorry for that, poor Hetty. Never mind--pale-face got a heaven for girl\r\nas well as for warrior."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the Serpent? Let me speak to him; give me his hand; so; I feel\r\nit. Delaware, you will love and cherish this young Indian woman--I know\r\nhow fond she is of you; you must be fond of her. Don\'t treat her as some\r\nof your people treat their wives; be a real husband to her. Now, bring\r\nDeerslayer near me; give me his hand."\r\n\r\nThis request was complied with, and the hunter stood by the side of\r\nthe pallet, submitting to the wishes of the girl with the docility of a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"I feel, Deerslayer," she resumed, "though I couldn\'t tell why--but\r\nI feel that you and I are not going to part for ever. \'Tis a strange\r\nfeeling! I never had it before; I wonder what it comes from!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis God encouraging you in extremity, Hetty; as such it ought to be\r\nharbored and respected. Yes, we shall meet ag\'in, though it may be a\r\nlong time first, and in a far distant land."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to be buried in the lake, too? If so, that may account for\r\nthe feeling."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis little likely, gal; \'tis little likely; but there\'s a region for\r\nChristian souls, where there\'s no lakes, nor woods, they say; though why\r\nthere should be none of the last, is more than I can account for; seeing\r\nthat pleasantness and peace is the object in view. My grave will be\r\nfound in the forest, most likely, but I hope my spirit will not be far\r\nfrom your\'n."\r\n\r\n"So it must be, then. I am too weak-minded to understand these things,\r\nbut I feel that you and I will meet again. Sister, where are you? I\r\ncan\'t see, now, anything but darkness. It must be night, surely!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Hetty, I am here at your side; these are my arms that are around\r\nyou," sobbed Judith. "Speak, dearest; is there anything you wish to say,\r\nor have done, in this awful moment."\r\n\r\nBy this time Hetty\'s sight had entirely failed her. Nevertheless death\r\napproached with less than usual of its horrors, as if in tenderness to\r\none of her half-endowed faculties. She was pale as a corpse, but her\r\nbreathing was easy and unbroken, while her voice, though lowered almost\r\nto a whisper, remained clear and distinct. When her sister put this\r\nquestion, however, a blush diffused itself over the features of the\r\ndying girl, so faint however as to be nearly imperceptible; resembling\r\nthat hue of the rose which is thought to portray the tint of modesty,\r\nrather than the dye of the flower in its richer bloom. No one but Judith\r\ndetected this exposure of feeling, one of the gentle expressions of\r\nwomanly sensibility, even in death. On her, however, it was not lost,\r\nnor did she conceal from herself the cause.\r\n\r\n"Hurry is here, dearest Hetty," whispered the sister, with her face so\r\nnear the sufferer as to keep the words from other ears. "Shall I tell\r\nhim to come and receive your good wishes?"\r\n\r\nA gentle pressure of the hand answered in the affirmative. Then Hurry\r\nwas brought to the side of the pallet. It is probable that this handsome\r\nbut rude woodsman had never before found himself so awkwardly placed,\r\nthough the inclination which Hetty felt for him (a sort of secret\r\nyielding to the instincts of nature, rather than any unbecoming impulse\r\nof an ill-regulated imagination), was too pure and unobtrusive to have\r\ncreated the slightest suspicion of the circumstance in his mind. He\r\nallowed Judith to put his hard colossal hand between those of Hetty, and\r\nstood waiting the result in awkward silence.\r\n\r\n"This is Hurry, dearest," whispered Judith, bending over her sister,\r\nashamed to utter the words so as to be audible to herself. "Speak to\r\nhim, and let him go."\r\n\r\n"What shall I say, Judith?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, whatever your own pure spirit teaches, my love. Trust to that, and\r\nyou need fear nothing."\r\n\r\n"Good bye, Hurry," murmured the girl, with a gentle pressure of his\r\nhand. "I wish you would try and be more like Deerslayer."\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with difficulty; a faint flush succeeded them\r\nfor a single instant. Then the hand was relinquished, and Hetty turned\r\nher face aside, as if done with the world. The mysterious feeling\r\nthat bound her to the young man, a sentiment so gentle as to be almost\r\nimperceptible to herself, and which could never have existed at all, had\r\nher reason possessed more command over her senses, was forever lost in\r\nthoughts of a more elevated, though scarcely of a purer character.\r\n\r\n"Of what are you thinking, my sweet sister?" whispered Judith "Tell me,\r\nthat I may aid you at this moment."\r\n\r\n"Mother--I see Mother, now, and bright beings around her in the lake.\r\nWhy isn\'t father there? It\'s odd that I can see Mother, when I can\'t see\r\nyou! Farewell, Judith."\r\n\r\nThe last words were uttered after a pause, and her sister had hung over\r\nher some time, in anxious watchfulness, before she perceived that\r\nthe gentle spirit had departed. Thus died Hetty Hutter, one of those\r\nmysterious links between the material and immaterial world, which, while\r\nthey appear to be deprived of so much that it is esteemed and necessary\r\nfor this state of being, draw so near to, and offer so beautiful an\r\nillustration of the truth, purity, and simplicity of another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n    "A baron\'s chylde to be begylde!\r\n    it were a cursed dede:\r\n    To be felawe with an outlawe!\r\n    Almighty God forbede!\r\n    Yea, better were, the pore squy\r\n    re alone to forest yede,\r\n    Then ye sholde say another day,\r\n    that by my cursed dede\r\n    Ye were betrayed:\r\n    wherefore, good mayde,\r\n    the best rede that I can,\r\n    Is, that I to the grene wode go, alone,\r\n    a banyshed man."\r\n\r\n    Thomas Percy, \'Nutbrowne Mayde,\' 11.  265-76 from Reliques of\r\n    Ancient English Poetry, Vol.  II.\r\n\r\nThe day that followed proved to be melancholy, though one of much\r\nactivity. The soldiers, who had so lately been employed in interring\r\ntheir victims, were now called on to bury their own dead. The scene\r\nof the morning had left a saddened feeling on all the gentlemen of the\r\nparty, and the rest felt the influence of a similar sensation, in a\r\nvariety of ways and from many causes. Hour dragged on after hour until\r\nevening arrived, and then came the last melancholy offices in honor of\r\npoor Hetty Hutter. Her body was laid in the lake, by the side of that of\r\nthe mother she had so loved and reverenced, the surgeon, though actually\r\nan unbeliever, so far complying with the received decencies of life as\r\nto read the funeral service over her grave, as he had previously done\r\nover those of the other Christian slain. It mattered not; that all\r\nseeing eye which reads the heart, could not fail to discriminate between\r\nthe living and the dead, and the gentle soul of the unfortunate girl\r\nwas already far removed beyond the errors, or deceptions, of any human\r\nritual. These simple rites, however, were not wholly wanting in suitable\r\naccompaniments. The tears of Judith and Hist were shed freely, and\r\nDeerslayer gazed upon the limpid water, that now flowed over one whose\r\nspirit was even purer than its own mountain springs, with glistening\r\neyes. Even the Delaware turned aside to conceal his weakness, while\r\nthe common men gazed on the ceremony with wondering eyes and chastened\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nThe business of the day closed with this pious office. By order of the\r\ncommanding officer, all retired early to rest, for it was intended to\r\nbegin the march homeward with the return of light. One party, indeed,\r\nbearing the wounded, the prisoners, and the trophies, had left the\r\ncastle in the middle of the day under the guidance of Hurry, intending\r\nto reach the fort by shorter marches. It had been landed on the point so\r\noften mentioned, or that described in our opening pages, and, when the\r\nsun set, was already encamped on the brow of the long, broken, and ridgy\r\nhills, that fell away towards the valley of the Mohawk. The departure of\r\nthis detachment had greatly simplified the duty of the succeeding day,\r\ndisencumbering its march of its baggage and wounded, and otherwise\r\nleaving him who had issued the order greater liberty of action.\r\n\r\nJudith held no communications with any but Hist, after the death of her\r\nsister, until she retired for the night. Her sorrow had been respected,\r\nand both the females had been left with the body, unintruded on, to the\r\nlast moment. The rattling of the drum broke the silence of that tranquil\r\nwater, and the echoes of the tattoo were heard among the mountains,\r\nso soon after the ceremony was over as to preclude the danger of\r\ninterruption. That star which had been the guide of Hist, rose on a\r\nscene as silent as if the quiet of nature had never yet been disturbed\r\nby the labors or passions of man. One solitary sentinel, with his\r\nrelief, paced the platform throughout the night, and morning was ushered\r\nin, as usual, by the martial beat of the reveille.\r\n\r\nMilitary precision succeeded to the desultory proceedings of border men,\r\nand when a hasty and frugal breakfast was taken, the party began its\r\nmovement towards the shore with a regularity and order that prevented\r\nnoise or confusion. Of all the officers, Warley alone remained. Craig\r\nheaded the detachment in advance, Thornton was with the wounded, and\r\nGraham accompanied his patients as a matter of course. Even the chest\r\nof Hutter, with all the more valuable of his effects, was borne away,\r\nleaving nothing behind that was worth the labor of a removal. Judith was\r\nnot sorry to see that the captain respected her feelings, and that he\r\noccupied himself entirely with the duty of his command, leaving her to\r\nher own discretion and feelings. It was understood by all that the place\r\nwas to be totally abandoned; but beyond this no explanations were asked\r\nor given.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers embarked in the Ark, with the captain at their head. He had\r\nenquired of Judith in what way she chose to proceed, and understanding\r\nher wish to remain with Hist to the last moment, he neither molested her\r\nwith requests, nor offended her with advice. There was but one safe\r\nand familiar trail to the Mohawk, and on that, at the proper hour,\r\nhe doubted not that they should meet in amity, if not in renewed\r\nintercourse. When all were on board, the sweeps were manned, and the Ark\r\nmoved in its sluggish manner towards the distant point. Deerslayer and\r\nChingachgook now lifted two of the canoes from the water, and placed\r\nthem in the castle. The windows and door were then barred, and the\r\nhouse was left by means of the trap, in the manner already described. On\r\nquitting the palisades, Hist was seen in the remaining canoe, where\r\nthe Delaware immediately joined her, and paddled away, leaving Judith\r\nstanding alone on the platform. Owing to this prompt proceeding,\r\nDeerslayer found himself alone with the beautiful and still weeping\r\nmourner. Too simple to suspect anything, the young man swept the light\r\nboat round, and received its mistress in it, when he followed the course\r\nalready taken by his friend. The direction to the point led diagonally\r\npast, and at no great distance from, the graves of the dead. As the\r\ncanoe glided by, Judith for the first time that morning spoke to her\r\ncompanion. She said but little; merely uttering a simple request to\r\nstop, for a minute or two, ere she left the place.\r\n\r\n"I may never see this spot again, Deerslayer," she said, "and it\r\ncontains the bodies of my mother and sister! Is it not possible, think\r\nyou, that the innocence of one of these beings may answer in the eyes of\r\nGod for the salvation of both?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it so, Judith, though I\'m no missionary, and am but\r\npoorly taught. Each spirit answers for its own backslidings, though a\r\nhearty repentance will satisfy God\'s laws."\r\n\r\n"Then must my poor poor mother be in heaven! Bitterly, bitterly has she\r\nrepented of her sins, and surely her sufferings in this life ought to\r\ncount as something against her sufferings in the next!"\r\n\r\n"All this goes beyond me, Judith. I strive to do right, here, as the\r\nsurest means of keeping all right, hereafter. Hetty was oncommon, as\r\nall that know\'d her must allow, and her soul was as fit to consart with\r\nangels the hour it left its body, as that of any saint in the Bible!"\r\n\r\n"I do believe you only do her justice! Alas! Alas! that there should be\r\nso great differences between those who were nursed at the same\r\nbreast, slept in the same bed, and dwelt under the same roof! But, no\r\nmatter--move the canoe, a little farther east, Deerslayer--the sun so\r\ndazzles my eyes that I cannot see the graves. This is Hetty\'s, on the\r\nright of mother\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Sartain--you ask\'d that of us, and all are glad to do as you wish,\r\nJudith, when you do that which is right."\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed at him near a minute, in silent attention; then she\r\nturned her eyes backward, at the castle. "This lake will soon be\r\nentirely deserted," she said, "and this, too, at a moment when it will\r\nbe a more secure dwelling place than ever. What has so lately happened\r\nwill prevent the Iroquois from venturing again to visit it for a long\r\ntime to come."\r\n\r\n"That it will! Yes, that may be set down as sartain. I do not mean to\r\npass this-a-way, ag\'in, so long as the war lasts, for, to my mind no\r\nHuron moccasin will leave its print on the leaves of this forest,\r\nuntil their traditions have forgotten to tell their young men of their\r\ndisgrace and rout."\r\n\r\n"And do you so delight in violence and bloodshed? I had thought better\r\nof you, Deerslayer--believed you one who could find his happiness in\r\na quiet domestic home, with an attached and loving wife ready to study\r\nyour wishes, and healthy and dutiful children anxious to follow in your\r\nfootsteps, and to become as honest and just as yourself."\r\n\r\n"Lord, Judith, what a tongue you\'re mistress of! Speech and looks go\r\nhand in hand, like, and what one can\'t do, the other is pretty sartain\r\nto perform! Such a gal, in a month, might spoil the stoutest warrior in\r\nthe colony."\r\n\r\n"And am I then so mistaken? Do you really love war, Deerslayer, better\r\nthan the hearth, and the affections?"\r\n\r\n"I understand your meaning, gal; yes, I do understand what you mean, I\r\nbelieve, though I don\'t think you altogether understand me. Warrior I\r\nmay now call myself, I suppose, for I\'ve both fou\'t and conquered, which\r\nis sufficient for the name; neither will I deny that I\'ve feelin\'s\r\nfor the callin\', which is both manful and honorable when carried on\r\naccordin\' to nat\'ral gifts, but I\'ve no relish for blood. Youth is\r\nyouth, howsever, and a Mingo is a Mingo. If the young men of this region\r\nstood by, and suffered the vagabonds to overrun the land, why, we might\r\nas well all turn Frenchers at once, and give up country and kin. I\'m no\r\nfire eater, Judith, or one that likes fightin\' for fightin\'s sake, but I\r\ncan see no great difference atween givin\' up territory afore a war, out\r\nof a dread of war, and givin\' it up a\'ter a war, because we can\'t help\r\nit, onless it be that the last is the most manful and honorable."\r\n\r\n"No woman would ever wish to see her husband or brother stand by and\r\nsubmit to insult and wrong, Deerslayer, however she might mourn the\r\nnecessity of his running into the dangers of battle. But, you\'ve done\r\nenough already, in clearing this region of the Hurons; since to you\r\nis principally owing the credit of our late victory. Now, listen to\r\nme patiently, and answer me with that native honesty, which it is as\r\npleasant to regard in one of your sex, as it is unusual to meet with."\r\n\r\nJudith paused, for now that she was on the very point of explaining\r\nherself, native modesty asserted its power, notwithstanding the\r\nencouragement and confidence she derived from the great simplicity of\r\nher companion\'s character. Her cheeks, which had so lately been pale,\r\nflushed, and her eyes lighted with some of their former brilliancy.\r\nFeeling gave expression to her countenance and softness to her voice,\r\nrendering her who was always beautiful, trebly seductive and winning.\r\n\r\n"Deerslayer," she said, after a considerable pause, "this is not a\r\nmoment for affectation, deception, or a want of frankness of any sort.\r\nHere, over my mother\'s grave, and over the grave of truth-loving,\r\ntruth-telling Hetty, everything like unfair dealing seems to be out of\r\nplace. I will, therefore, speak to you without any reserve, and without\r\nany dread of being misunderstood. You are not an acquaintance of a week,\r\nbut it appears to me as if I had known you for years. So much, and so\r\nmuch that is important has taken place, within that short time, that the\r\nsorrows, and dangers, and escapes of a whole life have been crowded\r\ninto a few days, and they who have suffered and acted together in such\r\nscenes, ought not to feel like strangers. I know that what I am about\r\nto say might be misunderstood by most men, but I hope for a generous\r\nconstruction of my course from you. We are not here, dwelling among the\r\narts and deceptions of the settlements, but young people who have no\r\noccasion to deceive each other, in any manner or form. I hope I make\r\nmyself understood?"\r\n\r\n"Sartain, Judith; few convarse better than yourself, and none more\r\nagreeable, like. Your words are as pleasant as your looks."\r\n\r\n"It is the manner in which you have so often praised those looks, that\r\ngives me courage to proceed. Still, Deerslayer, it is not easy for\r\none of my sex and years to forget all her lessons of infancy, all\r\nher habits, and her natural diffidence, and say openly what her heart\r\nfeels!"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Judith? Why shouldn\'t women as well as men deal fairly and\r\nhonestly by their fellow creatur\'s? I see no reason why you should not\r\nspeak as plainly as myself, when there is any thing ra\'ally important to\r\nbe said."\r\n\r\nThis indomitable diffidence, which still prevented the young man from\r\nsuspecting the truth, would have completely discouraged the girl, had\r\nnot her whole soul, as well as her whole heart, been set upon making a\r\ndesperate effort to rescue herself from a future that she dreaded with\r\na horror as vivid as the distinctness with which she fancied she foresaw\r\nit. This motive, however, raised her above all common considerations,\r\nand she persevered even to her own surprise, if not to her great\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n"I will--I must deal as plainly with you, as I would with poor, dear\r\nHetty, were that sweet child living!" she continued, turning pale\r\ninstead of blushing, the high resolution by which she was prompted\r\nreversing the effect that such a procedure would ordinarily produce on\r\none of her sex; "yes, I will smother all other feelings, in the one that\r\nis now uppermost! You love the woods and the life that we pass, here, in\r\nthe wilderness, away from the dwellings and towns of the whites."\r\n\r\n"As I loved my parents, Judith, when they was living! This very spot\r\nwould be all creation to me, could this war be fairly over, once; and\r\nthe settlers kept at a distance."\r\n\r\n"Why quit it, then? It has no owner--at least none who can claim\r\na better right than mine, and that I freely give to you. Were it a\r\nkingdom, Deerslayer, I think I should delight to say the same. Let us\r\nthen return to it, after we have seen the priest at the fort, and never\r\nquit it again, until God calls us away to that world where we shall find\r\nthe spirits of my poor mother and sister."\r\n\r\nA long, thoughtful pause succeeded; Judith here covered her face with\r\nboth her hands, after forcing herself to utter so plain a proposal, and\r\nDeerslayer musing equally in sorrow and surprise, on the meaning of\r\nthe language he had just heard. At length the hunter broke the silence,\r\nspeaking in a tone that was softened to gentleness by his desire not to\r\noffend.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t thought well of this, Judith," he said, "no, your feelin\'s\r\nare awakened by all that has lately happened, and believin\' yourself to\r\nbe without kindred in the world, you are in too great haste to find some\r\nto fill the places of them that\'s lost."\r\n\r\n"Were I living in a crowd of friends, Deerslayer, I should still think\r\nas I now think--say as I now say," returned Judith, speaking with her\r\nhands still shading her lovely face.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, gal--thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Howsever, I\r\nam not one to take advantage of a weak moment, when you\'re forgetful of\r\nyour own great advantages, and fancy \'arth and all it holds is in this\r\nlittle canoe. No--no--Judith, \'twould be onginerous in me; what you\'ve\r\noffered can never come to pass!"\r\n\r\n"It all may be, and that without leaving cause of repentance to any,"\r\nanswered Judith, with an impetuosity of feeling and manner that at once\r\nunveiled her eyes. "We can cause the soldiers to leave our goods on the\r\nroad, till we return, when they can easily be brought back to the house;\r\nthe lake will be no more visited by the enemy, this war at least; all\r\nyour skins may be readily sold at the garrison; there you can buy the\r\nfew necessaries we shall want, for I wish never to see the spot, again;\r\nand Deerslayer," added the girl smiling with a sweetness and nature that\r\nthe young man found it hard to resist, "as a proof how wholly I am and\r\nwish to be yours,--how completely I desire to be nothing but your wife,\r\nthe very first fire that we kindle, after our return, shall be lighted\r\nwith the brocade dress, and fed by every article I have that you may\r\nthink unfit for the woman you wish to live with!"\r\n\r\n"Ah\'s me!--you\'re a winning and a lovely creatur\', Judith; yes, you are\r\nall that, and no one can deny it and speak truth. These pictur\'s are\r\npleasant to the thoughts, but they mightn\'t prove so happy as you now\r\nthink \'em. Forget it all, therefore, and let us paddle after the Sarpent\r\nand Hist, as if nothing had been said on the subject."\r\n\r\nJudith was deeply mortified, and, what is more, she was profoundly\r\ngrieved. Still there was a steadiness and quiet in the manner of\r\nDeerslayer that completely smothered her hopes, and told her that for\r\nonce her exceeding beauty had failed to excite the admiration and homage\r\nit was wont to receive. Women are said seldom to forgive those who\r\nslight their advances, but this high spirited and impetuous girl\r\nentertained no shadow of resentment, then or ever, against the fair\r\ndealing and ingenuous hunter. At the moment, the prevailing feeling was\r\nthe wish to be certain that there was no misunderstanding. After another\r\npainful pause, therefore, she brought the matter to an issue by a\r\nquestion too direct to admit of equivocation.\r\n\r\n"God forbid that we lay up regrets, in after life, through my want of\r\nsincerity now," she said. "I hope we understand each other, at least.\r\nYou will not accept me for a wife, Deerslayer?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis better for both that I shouldn\'t take advantage of your own\r\nforgetfulness, Judith. We can never marry."\r\n\r\n"You do not love me,--cannot find it in your heart, perhaps, to esteem\r\nme, Deerslayer!"\r\n\r\n"Everything in the way of fri\'ndship, Judith--everything, even to\r\nsarvices and life itself. Yes, I\'d risk as much for you, at this moment,\r\nas I would risk in behalf of Hist, and that is sayin\' as much as I can\r\nsay of any darter of woman. I do not think I feel towards either--mind I\r\nsay either, Judith--as if I wished to quit father and mother--if father\r\nand mother was livin\', which, howsever, neither is--but if both was\r\nlivin\', I do not feel towards any woman as if I wish\'d to quit \'em in\r\norder to cleave unto her."\r\n\r\n"This is enough!" answered Judith, in a rebuked and smothered voice.\r\n"I understand all that you mean. Marry you cannot with loving, and that\r\nlove you do not feel for me. Make no answer, if I am right, for I shall\r\nunderstand your silence. That will be painful enough of itself."\r\n\r\nDeerslayer obeyed her, and he made no reply. For more than a minute, the\r\ngirl riveted her bright eyes on him as if to read his soul, while he\r\nwas playing with the water like a corrected school boy. Then Judith,\r\nherself, dropped the end of her paddle, and urged the canoe away from\r\nthe spot, with a movement as reluctant as the feelings which controlled\r\nit. Deerslayer quietly aided the effort, however, and they were soon on\r\nthe trackless line taken by the Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn their way to the point, not another syllable was exchanged between\r\nDeerslayer and his fair companion. As Judith sat in the bow of the\r\ncanoe, her back was turned towards him, else it is probable the\r\nexpression of her countenance might have induced him to venture some\r\nsoothing terms of friendship and regard. Contrary to what would have\r\nbeen expected, resentment was still absent, though the colour frequently\r\nchanged from the deep flush of mortification to the paleness of\r\ndisappointment. Sorrow, deep, heart-felt sorrow, however, was the\r\npredominant emotion, and this was betrayed in a manner not to be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nAs neither labored hard at the paddle, the ark had already arrived\r\nand the soldiers had disembarked before the canoe of the two loiterers\r\nreached the point. Chingachgook had preceded it, and was already some\r\ndistance in the wood, at a spot where the two trails, that to the\r\ngarrison and that to the villages of the Delawares, separated. The\r\nsoldiers, too, had taken up their line of march, first setting the Ark\r\nadrift again, with a reckless disregard of its fate. All this Judith\r\nsaw, but she heeded it not. The glimmerglass had no longer any charms\r\nfor her, and when she put her foot on the strand, she immediately\r\nproceeded on the trail of the soldiers without casting a single glance\r\nbehind her. Even Hist was passed unnoticed, that modest young creature\r\nshrinking from the averted face of Judith, as if guilty herself of some\r\nwrongdoing.\r\n\r\n"Wait you here, Sarpent," said Deerslayer as he followed in the\r\nfootsteps of the dejected beauty, while passing his friend. "I will just\r\nsee Judith among her party, and come and j\'ine you."\r\n\r\nA hundred yards had hid the couple from those in front, as well as those\r\nin their rear, when Judith turned, and spoke.\r\n\r\n"This will do, Deerslayer," she said sadly. "I understand your kindness\r\nbut shall not need it. In a few minutes I shall reach the soldiers. As\r\nyou cannot go with me on the journey of life, I do not wish you to go\r\nfurther on this. But, stop--before we part, I would ask you a single\r\nquestion. And I require of you, as you fear God, and reverence the\r\ntruth, not to deceive me in your answer. I know you do not love another\r\nand I can see but one reason why you cannot, will not love me. Tell me\r\nthen, Deerslayer," The girl paused, the words she was about to utter\r\nseeming to choke her. Then rallying all her resolution, with a face that\r\nflushed and paled at every breath she drew, she continued.\r\n\r\n"Tell me then, Deerslayer, if anything light of me, that Henry March has\r\nsaid, may not have influenced your feelings?"\r\n\r\nTruth was the Deerslayer\'s polar star. He ever kept it in view, and it\r\nwas nearly impossible for him to avoid uttering it, even when prudence\r\ndemanded silence. Judith read his answer in his countenance, and with a\r\nheart nearly broken by the consciousness of undue erring, she signed to\r\nhim an adieu, and buried herself in the woods. For some time Deerslayer\r\nwas irresolute as to his course; but, in the end, he retraced his steps,\r\nand joined the Delaware. That night the three camped on the head waters\r\nof their own river, and the succeeding evening they entered the village\r\nof the tribe, Chingachgook and his betrothed in triumph; their companion\r\nhonored and admired, but in a sorrow that it required months of activity\r\nto remove.\r\n\r\nThe war that then had its rise was stirring and bloody. The Delaware\r\nchief rose among his people, until his name was never mentioned without\r\neulogiums, while another Uncas, the last of his race, was added to the\r\nlong line of warriors who bore that distinguishing appellation. As for\r\nthe Deerslayer, under the sobriquet of Hawkeye, he made his fame spread\r\nfar and near, until the crack of his rifle became as terrible to the\r\nears of the Mingos as the thunders of the Manitou. His services were\r\nsoon required by the officers of the crown, and he especially attached\r\nhimself in the field to one in particular, with whose after life he had\r\na close and important connection.\r\n\r\nFifteen years had passed away, ere it was in the power of the Deerslayer\r\nto revisit the Glimmerglass. A peace had intervened, and it was on the\r\neve of another and still more important war, when he and his constant\r\nfriend, Chingachgook, were hastening to the forts to join their allies.\r\nA stripling accompanied them, for Hist already slumbered beneath\r\nthe pines of the Delawares, and the three survivors had now become\r\ninseparable. They reached the lake just as the sun was setting. Here all\r\nwas unchanged. The river still rushed through its bower of trees; the\r\nlittle rock was washing away, by the slow action of the waves, in the\r\ncourse of centuries, the mountains stood in their native dress, dark,\r\nrich and mysterious, while the sheet glistened in its solitude, a\r\nbeautiful gem of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, the youth discovered one of the canoes drifted\r\non the shore, in a state of decay. A little labor put it in a state for\r\nservice, and they all embarked, with a desire to examine the place. All\r\nthe points were passed, and Chingachgook pointed out to his son the\r\nspot where the Hurons had first encamped, and the point whence he had\r\nsucceeded in stealing his bride. Here they even landed, but all traces\r\nof the former visit had disappeared. Next they proceeded to the scene of\r\nthe battle, and there they found a few of the signs that linger around\r\nsuch localities. Wild beasts had disinterred many of the bodies, and\r\nhuman bones were bleaching in the rains of summer. Uncas regarded all\r\nwith reverence and pity, though traditions were already rousing his\r\nyoung mind to the ambition and sternness of a warrior.\r\n\r\nFrom the point, the canoe took its way toward the shoal, where the\r\nremains of the castle were still visible, a picturesque ruin. The storms\r\nof winter had long since unroofed the house, and decay had eaten into\r\nthe logs. All the fastenings were untouched, but the seasons rioted\r\nin the place, as if in mockery at the attempt to exclude them. The\r\npalisades were rotting, as were the piles, and it was evident that a few\r\nmore recurrences of winter, a few more gales and tempests, would\r\nsweep all into the lake, and blot the building from the face of that\r\nmagnificent solitude. The graves could not be found. Either the elements\r\nhad obliterated their traces, or time had caused those who looked for\r\nthem to forget their position.\r\n\r\nThe Ark was discovered stranded on the eastern shore, where it had long\r\nbefore been driven with the prevalent northwest winds. It lay on the\r\nsandy extremity of a long low point, that is situated about two miles\r\nfrom the outlet, and which is itself fast disappearing before the action\r\nof the elements. The scow was filled with water, the cabin unroofed, and\r\nthe logs were decaying. Some of its coarser furniture still remained,\r\nand the heart of Deerslayer beat quick, as he found a ribbon of Judith\'s\r\nfluttering from a log. It recalled all her beauty, and we may add\r\nall her failings. Although the girl had never touched his heart, the\r\nHawkeye, for so we ought now to call him, still retained a kind and\r\nsincere interest in her welfare. He tore away the ribbon, and knotted it\r\nto the stock of Killdeer, which had been the gift of the girl herself.\r\n\r\nA few miles farther up the lake, another of the canoes was discovered,\r\nand on the point where the party finally landed, were found those which\r\nhad been left there upon the shore. That in which the present navigation\r\nwas made, and the one discovered on the eastern shore, had dropped\r\nthrough the decayed floor of the castle, drifted past the falling\r\npalisades, and had been thrown as waifs upon the beach.\r\n\r\nFrom all these signs, it was probable the lake had not been visited\r\nsince the occurrence of the final scene of our tale. Accident or\r\ntradition had rendered it again a spot sacred to nature, the frequent\r\nwars and the feeble population of the colonies still confining the\r\nsettlements within narrow boundaries. Chingachgook and his friend left\r\nthe spot with melancholy feelings. It had been the region of their First\r\nWar Path, and it carried back the minds of both to scenes of tenderness,\r\nas well as to hours of triumph. They held their way towards the Mohawk\r\nin silence, however, to rush into new adventures, as stirring and as\r\nremarkable as those which had attended their opening careers on this\r\nlovely lake. At a later day they returned to the place, where the Indian\r\nfound a grave.\r\n\r\nTime and circumstances have drawn an impenetrable mystery around all\r\nelse connected with the Hutters. They lived, erred, died, and are\r\nforgotten. None connected have felt sufficient interest in the disgraced\r\nand disgracing to withdraw the veil, and a century is about to erase\r\neven the recollection of their names. The history of crime is ever\r\nrevolting, and it is fortunate that few love to dwell on its incidents.\r\nThe sins of the family have long since been arraigned at the judgment\r\nseat of God, or are registered for the terrible settlement of the last\r\ngreat day.\r\n\r\nThe same fate attended Judith. When Hawkeye reached the garrison on the\r\nMohawk he enquired anxiously after that lovely but misguided creature.\r\nNone knew her--even her person was no longer remembered. Other officers\r\nhad, again and again, succeeded the Warleys and Craigs and Grahams,\r\nthough an old sergeant of the garrison, who had lately come from\r\nEngland, was enabled to tell our hero that Sir Robert Warley lived on\r\nhis paternal estates, and that there was a lady of rare beauty in the\r\nLodge who had great influence over him, though she did not bear his\r\nname. Whether this was Judith relapsed into her early failing, or some\r\nother victim of the soldier\'s, Hawkeye never knew, nor would it be\r\npleasant or profitable to inquire. We live in a world of transgressions\r\nand selfishness, and no pictures that represent us otherwise can be\r\ntrue, though, happily, for human nature, gleamings of that pure spirit\r\nin whose likeness man has been fashioned are to be seen, relieving its\r\ndeformities, and mitigating if not excusing its crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Deerslayer, by James Fenimore Cooper\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DEERSLAYER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3285-8.txt or 3285-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/8/3285/\r\n\r\nProduced by Stephen Kerr and Martin Robb\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
