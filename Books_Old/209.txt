The case,\r\nI may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as\r\nhad gathered us for the occasion\xe2\x80\x94an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to\r\na little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in\r\nthe terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him\r\nto sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had\r\nsucceeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this\r\nobservation that drew from Douglas\xe2\x80\x94not immediately, but later in the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call\r\nattention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which\r\nI saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself\r\nsomething to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in\r\nfact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered,\r\nhe brought out what was in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree\xe2\x80\x94in regard to Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s ghost, or whatever it was\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nits appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a\r\nparticular touch. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first occurrence of its charming\r\nkind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the\r\neffect another turn of the screw, what do you say to _two_ children\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe say, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d somebody exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they give two turns!\r\nAlso that we want to hear about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to\r\npresent his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in\r\nhis pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite too\r\nhorrible.\xe2\x80\x9d This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the\r\nthing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his\r\ntriumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor sheer terror?\xe2\x80\x9d I remember asking.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss\r\nhow to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little\r\nwincing grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cFor dreadful\xe2\x80\x94dreadfulness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the women.\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he\r\nsaw what he spoke of. \xe2\x80\x9cFor general uncanny ugliness and horror and\r\npain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cjust sit right down and begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an\r\ninstant. Then as he faced us again: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t begin. I shall have to\r\nsend to town.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach;\r\nafter which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThe story\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten. It\xe2\x80\x99s in a locked drawer\xe2\x80\x94it has not been out for years. I could\r\nwrite to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as\r\nhe finds it.\xe2\x80\x9d It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a\r\nthickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons\r\nfor a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just\r\nhis scruples that charmed me. I adjured him to write by the first post\r\nand to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the\r\nexperience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank God, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is the record yours? You took the thing down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but the impression. I took that _here_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he tapped his heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never lost it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your manuscript\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.\xe2\x80\x9d He hung fire\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me\r\nthe pages in question before she died.\xe2\x80\x9d They were all listening now,\r\nand of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the\r\ninference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also\r\nwithout irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was a most charming person, but she was ten\r\nyears older than I. She was my sister\xe2\x80\x99s governess,\xe2\x80\x9d he quietly said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was the most agreeable woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known in her position; she\r\nwould have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this\r\nepisode was long before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on\r\nmy coming down the second summer. I was much there that year\xe2\x80\x94it was a\r\nbeautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in\r\nthe garden\xe2\x80\x94talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh\r\nyes; don\xe2\x80\x99t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think\r\nshe liked me, too. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told me. She had\r\nnever told anyone. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply that she said so, but that I knew\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was sure; I could see. You\xe2\x80\x99ll easily judge why when you\r\nhear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the thing had been such a scare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to fix me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll easily judge,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9c_you_\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fixed him, too. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. She was in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ acute. Yes, she was in love.\r\nThat is, she had been. That came out\xe2\x80\x94she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her story\r\nwithout its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of\r\nus spoke of it. I remember the time and the place\xe2\x80\x94the corner of the\r\nlawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer\r\nafternoon. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a scene for a shudder; but oh\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He quitted the\r\nfire and dropped back into his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll receive the packet Thursday morning?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not till the second post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then; after dinner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll all meet me here?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked us round again. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d It was almost the tone of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody will stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ will\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ will!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the ladies whose departure had been\r\nfixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more\r\nlight. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it she was in love with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story will tell,\xe2\x80\x9d I took upon myself to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for the story!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Douglas; \xe2\x80\x9cnot in any literal, vulgar\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore\xe2\x80\x99s the pity, then. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way I ever understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ tell, Douglas?\xe2\x80\x9d somebody else inquired.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94tomorrow. Now I must go to bed. Good\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly\r\nbewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on\r\nthe stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who she\r\nwas in love with, I know who _he_ was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was ten years older,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Raison de plus_\xe2\x80\x94at that age! But it\xe2\x80\x99s rather nice, his long\r\nreticence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty years!\xe2\x80\x9d Griffin put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this outbreak at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe outbreak,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwill make a tremendous occasion of\r\nThursday night;\xe2\x80\x9d and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of\r\nit, we lost all attention for everything else. The last story, however\r\nincomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we\r\nhandshook and \xe2\x80\x9ccandlestuck,\xe2\x80\x9d as somebody said, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nI knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first\r\npost, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps\r\njust on account of\xe2\x80\x94the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite\r\nlet him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in\r\nfact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes\r\nwere fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and\r\nindeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again\r\nbefore the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the\r\nprevious night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read\r\nus really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.\r\nLet me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative,\r\nfrom an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall\r\npresently give. Poor Douglas, before his death\xe2\x80\x94when it was in\r\nsight\xe2\x80\x94committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of\r\nthese days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to\r\nread to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The\r\ndeparting ladies who had said they would stay didn\xe2\x80\x99t, of course, thank\r\nheaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a\r\nrage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with\r\nwhich he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final\r\nauditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to\r\na common thrill.\r\n\r\nThe first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up\r\nthe tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in\r\npossession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of\r\nseveral daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty,\r\non taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to\r\nLondon, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had\r\nalready placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This\r\nperson proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in\r\nHarley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing\xe2\x80\x94this prospective\r\npatron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a\r\nfigure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a\r\nfluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily\r\nfix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and\r\npleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as\r\ngallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the\r\ncourage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as\r\na kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She\r\nconceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant\xe2\x80\x94saw him all in a\r\nglow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming\r\nways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled\r\nwith the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to\r\nhis country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her\r\nimmediately to proceed.\r\n\r\nHe had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a\r\nsmall nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military\r\nbrother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the\r\nstrangest of chances for a man in his position\xe2\x80\x94a lone man without the\r\nright sort of experience or a grain of patience\xe2\x80\x94very heavily on his\r\nhands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a\r\nseries of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had\r\ndone all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house,\r\nthe proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them\r\nthere, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after\r\nthem, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down\r\nhimself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward\r\nthing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own\r\naffairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly,\r\nwhich was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their\r\nlittle establishment\xe2\x80\x94but below stairs only\xe2\x80\x94an excellent woman, Mrs.\r\nGrose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly\r\nbeen maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting\r\nfor the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without\r\nchildren of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were\r\nplenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go\r\ndown as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have,\r\nin holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at\r\nschool\xe2\x80\x94young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwho, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to\r\nthe other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady\r\nwhom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite\r\nbeautifully\xe2\x80\x94she was a most respectable person\xe2\x80\x94till her death, the great\r\nawkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school\r\nfor little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and\r\nthings, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a\r\ncook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old\r\ngardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.\r\n\r\nSo far had Douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the former governess die of?\xe2\x80\x94of so much respectability?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend\xe2\x80\x99s answer was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will come out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanticipate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me\xe2\x80\x94I thought that was just what you _are_ doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn her successor\xe2\x80\x99s place,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have wished to learn\r\nif the office brought with it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNecessary danger to life?\xe2\x80\x9d Douglas completed my thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe did wish\r\nto learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what she learned.\r\nMeanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was\r\nyoung, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little\r\ncompany, of really great loneliness. She hesitated\xe2\x80\x94took a couple of\r\ndays to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her\r\nmodest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she\r\nengaged.\xe2\x80\x9d And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of\r\nthe company, moved me to throw in\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the\r\nsplendid young man. She succumbed to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave\r\na stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe saw him only twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beauty of her passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_\r\nthe beauty of it. There were others,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwho hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuccumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty\xe2\x80\x94that for several\r\napplicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow,\r\nsimply afraid. It sounded dull\xe2\x80\x94it sounded strange; and all the more so\r\nbecause of his main condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich was\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she should never trouble him\xe2\x80\x94but never, never: neither appeal nor\r\ncomplain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself,\r\nreceive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and\r\nlet him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that\r\nwhen, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking\r\nher for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut was that all her reward?\xe2\x80\x9d one of the ladies asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never saw him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again,\r\nwas the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till,\r\nthe next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he\r\nopened the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album.\r\nThe whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first\r\noccasion the same lady put another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your title?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ have!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to\r\nread with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the\r\nbeauty of his author\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a\r\nlittle seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town,\r\nto meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days\xe2\x80\x94found\r\nmyself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this\r\nstate of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that\r\ncarried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle\r\nfrom the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I\r\nfound, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in\r\nwaiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a\r\ncountry to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly\r\nwelcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue,\r\nencountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to\r\nwhich it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something\r\nso melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a\r\nmost pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and\r\nfresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn\r\nand the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and\r\nthe clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the\r\ngolden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair\r\nfrom my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door,\r\nwith a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent\r\na curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I\r\nhad received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that,\r\nas I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a\r\ngentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond\r\nhis promise.\r\n\r\nI had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly\r\nthrough the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my\r\npupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on\r\nthe spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have\r\nto do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I\r\nafterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I\r\nslept little that night\xe2\x80\x94I was too much excited; and this astonished me,\r\ntoo, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the\r\nliberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of\r\nthe best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the\r\nfull, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time,\r\nI could see myself from head to foot, all struck me\xe2\x80\x94like the\r\nextraordinary charm of my small charge\xe2\x80\x94as so many things thrown in. It\r\nwas thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with\r\nMrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I\r\nhad rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook\r\nmight have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being\r\nso glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so\r\nglad\xe2\x80\x94stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman\xe2\x80\x94as to be positively\r\non her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little\r\nwhy she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with\r\nsuspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.\r\n\r\nBut it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection\r\nwith anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the\r\nvision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to\r\ndo with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times\r\nrise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and\r\nprospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look\r\nat such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to\r\nlisten, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter,\r\nfor the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not\r\nwithout, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a\r\nmoment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child;\r\nthere had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as\r\nat the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies\r\nwere not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the\r\nlight, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent\r\nmatters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, \xe2\x80\x9cform\xe2\x80\x9d little\r\nFlora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It\r\nhad been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I\r\nshould have her as a matter of course at night, her small white bed\r\nbeing already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken\r\nwas the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time,\r\nwith Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my\r\ninevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this\r\ntimidity\xe2\x80\x94which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had\r\nbeen perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of\r\nuncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of\r\none of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her,\r\nand to determine us\xe2\x80\x94I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It\r\nwas part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I\r\ncould see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with\r\nfour tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib,\r\nbrightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were\r\nnaturally things that in Flora\xe2\x80\x99s presence could pass between us only as\r\nprodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the little boy\xe2\x80\x94does he look like her? Is he too so very\r\nremarkable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flatter a child. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, miss, _most_ remarkable. If you\r\nthink well of this one!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she stood there with a plate in her hand,\r\nbeaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with\r\nplacid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if I do\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ be carried away by the little gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that, I think, is what I came for\xe2\x80\x94to be carried away. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, however,\xe2\x80\x9d I remember feeling the impulse to add, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather\r\neasily carried away. I was carried away in London!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can still see Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s broad face as she took this in. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Harley\r\nStreet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Harley Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, miss, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the first\xe2\x80\x94and you won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no pretension,\xe2\x80\x9d I could laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cto being the only one. My\r\nother pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94Friday, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under\r\ncare of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and\r\nfriendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public\r\nconveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an\r\nidea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took her\r\nmanner as a kind of comforting pledge\xe2\x80\x94never falsified, thank\r\nheaven!\xe2\x80\x94that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was\r\nglad I was there!\r\n\r\nWhat I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly\r\ncalled a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the\r\nmost only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the\r\nscale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my\r\nnew circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I\r\nhad not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself,\r\nfreshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this\r\nagitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first\r\nduty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into\r\nthe sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I\r\narranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she,\r\nshe only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and\r\nroom by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish\r\ntalk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming\r\nimmense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little\r\ntour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers\r\nand dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even\r\non the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy,\r\nher morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than\r\nshe asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I\r\nleft it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would\r\nnow appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with\r\nher hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners\r\nand pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance\r\ninhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for\r\ndiversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and\r\nfairytales. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze\r\nand adream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house,\r\nembodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and\r\nhalf-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as\r\na handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was,\r\nstrangely, at the helm!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThis came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to\r\nmeet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an\r\nincident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply\r\ndisconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have\r\nexpressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen\r\napprehension. The postbag, that evening\xe2\x80\x94it came late\xe2\x80\x94contained a letter\r\nfor me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be\r\ncomposed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself,\r\nwith a seal still unbroken. \xe2\x80\x9cThis, I recognize, is from the headmaster,\r\nand the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him;\r\nbut mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t report. Not a word. I\xe2\x80\x99m off!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke the seal with\r\na great effort\xe2\x80\x94so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took\r\nthe unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just\r\nbefore going to bed. I had better have let it wait till morning, for it\r\ngave me a second sleepless night. With no counsel to take, the next\r\nday, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me\r\nthat I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean? The child\xe2\x80\x99s dismissed his school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a\r\nquick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. \xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t they all\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSent home\xe2\x80\x94yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConsciously, under my attention, she reddened. \xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t take him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey absolutely decline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them\r\nfill with good tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter\xe2\x80\x94which,\r\nhowever, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put\r\nher hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch things are not\r\nfor me, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy counselor couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated\r\nas I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then,\r\nfaltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my\r\npocket. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he really _bad_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears were still in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo the gentlemen say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it\r\nshould be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nGrose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this\r\nmeaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some\r\ncoherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went\r\non: \xe2\x80\x9cThat he\xe2\x80\x99s an injury to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly\r\nflamed up. \xe2\x80\x9cMaster Miles! _him_ an injury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet\r\nseen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the\r\nidea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the\r\nspot, sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cTo his poor little innocent mates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Grose, \xe2\x80\x9cto say such cruel things! Why,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s scarce ten years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; it would be incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was evidently grateful for such a profession. \xe2\x80\x9cSee him, miss,\r\nfirst. _Then_ believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d I felt forthwith a new impatience to see\r\nhim; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours,\r\nwas to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of\r\nwhat she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nthe next moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_look_ at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had\r\nestablished in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil,\r\nand a copy of nice \xe2\x80\x9cround O\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d now presented herself to view at the\r\nopen door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment\r\nfrom disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish\r\nlight that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had\r\nconceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should\r\nfollow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of\r\nMrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her\r\nwith kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to\r\napproach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy\r\nshe rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the\r\nstaircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her,\r\nholding her there with a hand on her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI take what you said to me\r\nat noon as a declaration that _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_ never known him to be bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very\r\nhonestly, adopted an attitude. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, never known him\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\n_that!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was upset again. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you _have_ known him\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed, miss, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn reflection I accepted this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that a boy who never is\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs no boy for _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held her tighter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like them with the spirit to be naughty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, keeping pace with her answer, \xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d I eagerly brought out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not to the degree to contaminate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo contaminate?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94my big word left her at a loss. I explained it. \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\ncorrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll corrupt _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d She put the question with such a\r\nfine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match\r\nher own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.\r\n\r\nBut the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in\r\nanother place. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the lady who was here before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last governess? She was also young and pretty\xe2\x80\x94almost as young and\r\nalmost as pretty, miss, even as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\xe2\x80\x9d I recollect\r\nthrowing off. \xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to like us young and pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he _did_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose assented: \xe2\x80\x9cit was the way he liked\r\neveryone!\xe2\x80\x9d She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that\xe2\x80\x99s _his_ way\xe2\x80\x94the master\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was struck. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of whom did you speak first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked blank, but she colored. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf who else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my\r\nimpression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I\r\nmerely asked what I wanted to know. \xe2\x80\x9cDid _she_ see anything in the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right? She never told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had a scruple, but I overcame it. \xe2\x80\x9cWas she careful\xe2\x80\x94particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout some\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not about all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she considered. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, miss\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell tales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand your feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d I hastened to reply; but I thought\r\nit, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nshe die here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94she went off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s that struck\r\nme as ambiguous. \xe2\x80\x9cWent off to die?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose looked straight out of\r\nthe window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what\r\nyoung persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was taken ill,\r\nyou mean, and went home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it,\r\nat the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday,\r\nto which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We\r\nhad then a young woman\xe2\x80\x94a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good\r\ngirl and clever; and _she_ took the children altogether for the\r\ninterval. But our young lady never came back, and at the very moment I\r\nwas expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned this over. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never told me! But please, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grose, \xe2\x80\x9cI must get to\r\nmy work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHer thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just\r\npreoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual\r\nesteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately\r\nthan ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so\r\nmonstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now\r\nbeen revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little late\r\non the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me\r\nbefore the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that I\r\nhad seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of\r\nfreshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from\r\nthe first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful,\r\nand Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of\r\npassion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I\r\nthen and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I\r\nhave never found to the same degree in any child\xe2\x80\x94his indescribable\r\nlittle air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been\r\nimpossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence,\r\nand by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely\r\nbewildered\xe2\x80\x94so far, that is, as I was not outraged\xe2\x80\x94by the sense of the\r\nhorrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could\r\ncompass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was\r\ngrotesque.\r\n\r\nShe promptly understood me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the cruel charge\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live an instant. My dear woman, _look_ at him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure\r\nyou, miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn answer to the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d I had made up my mind. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to his uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was incisive. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to the boy himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was wonderful. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by\r\nyou. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see it out!\xe2\x80\x9d I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a\r\nvow.\r\n\r\nShe held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her\r\ndetached hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind, miss, if I used the freedom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo kiss me? No!\xe2\x80\x9d I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had\r\nembraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.\r\n\r\nThis, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall\r\nthe way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a\r\nlittle distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I\r\naccepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was\r\nunder a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the\r\nfar and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on\r\na great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my\r\nignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could\r\ndeal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of\r\nbeginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I\r\nframed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies.\r\nLessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that\r\nhe was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have\r\nbeen rather my own. I learned something\xe2\x80\x94at first, certainly\xe2\x80\x94that had\r\nnot been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to\r\nbe amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was\r\nthe first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and\r\nfreedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And\r\nthen there was consideration\xe2\x80\x94and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a\r\ntrap\xe2\x80\x94not designed, but deep\xe2\x80\x94to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps\r\nto my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to\r\npicture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so\r\nlittle trouble\xe2\x80\x94they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to\r\nspeculate\xe2\x80\x94but even this with a dim disconnectedness\xe2\x80\x94as to how the rough\r\nfuture (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise\r\nthem. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had\r\nbeen in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood,\r\nfor whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and\r\nprotected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take\r\nfor them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden\r\nand the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke\r\ninto this gives the previous time a charm of stillness\xe2\x80\x94that hush in\r\nwhich something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the\r\nspring of a beast.\r\n\r\nIn the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest,\r\ngave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils,\r\nteatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final\r\nretirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this\r\nhour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all\r\nwhen, as the light faded\xe2\x80\x94or rather, I should say, the day lingered and\r\nthe last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the\r\nold trees\xe2\x80\x94I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a\r\nsense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity\r\nof the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself\r\ntranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my\r\ndiscretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was\r\ngiving pleasure\xe2\x80\x94if he ever thought of it!\xe2\x80\x94to the person to whose\r\npressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly\r\nhoped and directly asked of me, and that I _could_, after all, do it\r\nproved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied\r\nmyself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the\r\nfaith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be\r\nremarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently\r\ngave their first sign.\r\n\r\nIt was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the\r\nchildren were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the\r\nthoughts that, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least shrink now from noting, used to\r\nbe with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a\r\ncharming story suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear there at\r\nthe turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t ask more than that\xe2\x80\x94I only asked that he should _know;_ and the\r\nonly way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of\r\nit, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me\xe2\x80\x94by which I\r\nmean the face was\xe2\x80\x94when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of\r\na long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the\r\nplantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the\r\nspot\xe2\x80\x94and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nthe sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did\r\nstand there!\xe2\x80\x94but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the\r\ntower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me.\r\nThis tower was one of a pair\xe2\x80\x94square, incongruous, crenelated\r\nstructures\xe2\x80\x94that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see\r\nlittle difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends\r\nof the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a\r\nmeasure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too\r\npretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic\r\nrevival that was already a respectable past. I admired them, had\r\nfancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially\r\nwhen they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual\r\nbattlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had\r\nso often invoked seemed most in place.\r\n\r\nIt produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two\r\ndistinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first\r\nand that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of\r\nthe mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I\r\nhad precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of\r\nvision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can\r\nhope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of\r\nfear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94a few more seconds assured me\xe2\x80\x94as little anyone else I knew as it\r\nwas the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley\r\nStreet\xe2\x80\x94I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the\r\nstrangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact\r\nof its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my\r\nstatement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the\r\nwhole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nI did take in\xe2\x80\x94all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I\r\ncan hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of\r\nevening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the\r\nfriendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no\r\nother change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with\r\na stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in\r\nthe air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as\r\ndefinite as a picture in a frame. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I thought, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and\r\nthat he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long\r\nenough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel,\r\nas an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants\r\nmore became intense.\r\n\r\nThe great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard\r\nto certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well,\r\nthis matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught\r\nat a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the\r\nbetter, that I could see, in there having been in the house\xe2\x80\x94and for how\r\nlong, above all?\xe2\x80\x94a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I\r\njust bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there\r\nshould be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this\r\nvisitant, at all events\xe2\x80\x94and there was a touch of the strange freedom,\r\nas I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat\xe2\x80\x94seemed\r\nto fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny\r\nthrough the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too\r\nfar apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at\r\nshorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have\r\nbeen the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of\r\nthe angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me,\r\nand with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I\r\nform on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the\r\nspectacle, he slowly changed his place\xe2\x80\x94passed, looking at me hard all\r\nthe while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the\r\nsharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me,\r\nand I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from\r\none of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner,\r\nbut less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He\r\nturned away; that was all I knew.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was not that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was\r\nrooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a \xe2\x80\x9csecret\xe2\x80\x9d at Bly\xe2\x80\x94a mystery\r\nof Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected\r\nconfinement? I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a\r\nconfusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my\r\ncollision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had\r\nquite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and\r\ndriven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three\r\nmiles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this\r\nmere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular\r\npart of it, in fact\xe2\x80\x94singular as the rest had been\xe2\x80\x94was the part I\r\nbecame, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes\r\nback to me in the general train\xe2\x80\x94the impression, as I received it on my\r\nreturn, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and\r\nwith its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my\r\nfriend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me\r\nstraightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere\r\nrelieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could\r\nbear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected\r\nin advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow\r\nmeasured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself\r\nhesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to\r\nme so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may\r\nsay, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot,\r\naccordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a\r\nreason that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t then have phrased, achieved an inward\r\nresolution\xe2\x80\x94offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea\r\nof the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as\r\nsoon as possible to my room.\r\n\r\nHere it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer\r\naffair enough. There were hours, from day to day\xe2\x80\x94or at least there were\r\nmoments, snatched even from clear duties\xe2\x80\x94when I had to shut myself up\r\nto think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could\r\nbear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the\r\ntruth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I\r\ncould arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been\r\nso inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned.\r\nIt took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry\r\nand without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had\r\nsuffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of\r\nthree days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not\r\nbeen practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any \xe2\x80\x9cgame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOf whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was\r\nbut one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. That\r\nwas what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say\r\nto myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some\r\nunscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in\r\nunobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then\r\nstolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that\r\nwas but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that\r\nwe should surely see no more of him.\r\n\r\nThis was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that\r\nwhat, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my\r\ncharming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora,\r\nand through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could\r\nthrow myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was\r\na constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my\r\noriginal fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the\r\nprobable gray prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it\r\nappeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that\r\npresented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery\r\nand the poetry of the schoolroom. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean by this, of course, that\r\nwe studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise\r\nthe sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that\r\nexcept by saying that instead of growing used to them\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s a marvel\r\nfor a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!\xe2\x80\x94I made constant\r\nfresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these\r\ndiscoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have\r\nnoted, to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be\r\nnearer the truth to say that\xe2\x80\x94without a word\xe2\x80\x94he himself had cleared it\r\nup. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there\r\nwith the real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and\r\nfair for the little horrid, unclean school-world, and he had paid a\r\nprice for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences,\r\nsuch superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the\r\nmajority\xe2\x80\x94which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters\xe2\x80\x94turn\r\ninfallibly to the vindictive.\r\n\r\nBoth the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it\r\nnever made Miles a muff) that kept them\xe2\x80\x94how shall I express it?\xe2\x80\x94almost\r\nimpersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs\r\nof the anecdote, who had\xe2\x80\x94morally, at any rate\xe2\x80\x94nothing to whack! I\r\nremember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were,\r\nno history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in\r\nthis beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet\r\nextraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I\r\nhave seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a\r\nsecond suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really\r\nbeen chastised. If he had been wicked he would have \xe2\x80\x9ccaught\xe2\x80\x9d it, and I\r\nshould have caught it by the rebound\xe2\x80\x94I should have found the trace. I\r\nfound nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of\r\nhis school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part,\r\nwas quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under\r\nthe spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I\r\nperfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to\r\nany pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in these days\r\nof disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But\r\nwith my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the\r\nquestion I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by\r\ntheir loveliness.\r\n\r\nThere was a Sunday\xe2\x80\x94to get on\xe2\x80\x94when it rained with such force and for so\r\nmany hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence\r\nof which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that,\r\nshould the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late\r\nservice. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which,\r\nthrough the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter\r\nof twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall,\r\nI remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that\r\nhad received them\xe2\x80\x94with a publicity perhaps not edifying\xe2\x80\x94while I sat\r\nwith the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in\r\nthat cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the \xe2\x80\x9cgrown-up\xe2\x80\x9d dining\r\nroom. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover\r\nthem. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered,\r\nand it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on\r\na chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but\r\nto become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking\r\nstraight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was\r\ninstantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the\r\nperson who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a\r\nnearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made\r\nme, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nthe same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the\r\nwaist up, the window, though the dining room was on the ground floor,\r\nnot going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to\r\nthe glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to\r\nshow me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few\r\nseconds\xe2\x80\x94long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it\r\nwas as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always.\r\nSomething, however, happened this time that had not happened before;\r\nhis stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as\r\ndeep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I\r\ncould still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On\r\nthe spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was\r\nnot for me he had come there. He had come for someone else.\r\n\r\nThe flash of this knowledge\xe2\x80\x94for it was knowledge in the midst of\r\ndread\xe2\x80\x94produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood\r\nthere, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I\r\nwas beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the\r\ndoor again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the\r\ndrive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a\r\ncorner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nvisitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief\r\nof this; but I took in the whole scene\xe2\x80\x94I gave him time to reappear. I\r\ncall it time, but how long was it? I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the purpose today\r\nof the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left\r\nme: they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last.\r\nThe terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all\r\nI could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were\r\nshrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt\r\nthat none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not\r\nthere if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively,\r\ninstead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was\r\nconfusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had\r\nstood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had\r\nlooked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what\r\nhis range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before,\r\ncame in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition\r\nof what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;\r\nshe pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock\r\nthat I had received. She turned white, and this made me ask myself if I\r\nhad blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just _my_\r\nlines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that\r\nI should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited\r\nI thought of more things than one. But there\xe2\x80\x99s only one I take space to\r\nmention. I wondered why _she_ should be scared.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she\r\nloomed again into view. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the name of goodness is the matter\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe was now flushed and out of breath.\r\n\r\nI said nothing till she came quite near. \xe2\x80\x9cWith me?\xe2\x80\x9d I must have made a\r\nwonderful face. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I show it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as white as a sheet. You look awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My\r\nneed to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s had dropped, without a\r\nrustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not\r\nwith what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held\r\nher hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of\r\nsupport in the shy heave of her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou came for me for church,\r\nof course, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough this window? Dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s eyes expressed\r\nplainly that _she_ had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well\r\nher place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience.\r\nOh, it was quite settled that she _must_ share! \xe2\x80\x9cJust what you saw from\r\nthe dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What _I_ saw\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94was much worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand tightened. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn extraordinary man. Looking in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat extraordinary man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. \xe2\x80\x9cThen where is he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know still less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94once. On the old tower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could only look at me harder. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he\xe2\x80\x99s a stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94for reasons. But now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s round eyes encountered this charge. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nguessed!\xe2\x80\x9d she said very simply. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I if _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t in the very least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on this spot just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose looked round again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he doing on the tower?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly standing there and looking down at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cWas he a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found I had no need to think. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d She gazed in deeper wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x94nobody. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, but I made sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It\r\nonly went indeed a little way. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ he? He\xe2\x80\x99s a horror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horror?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94God help me if I know _what_ he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier\r\ndistance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt\r\ninconsequence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time we should be at church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit for church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t it do you good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do _them!_\xe2\x80\x94 I nodded at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave them now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke boldly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the\r\nfaraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out\r\nin it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that\r\nwas as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought\r\ninstantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to\r\nbe connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nwas it\xe2\x80\x94on the tower?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the middle of the month. At this same hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost at dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how did he get in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did he get out?\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no opportunity to ask him!\r\nThis evening, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued, \xe2\x80\x9che has not been able to get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only peeps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it will be confined to that!\xe2\x80\x9d She had now let go my hand; she\r\nturned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cGo to\r\nchurch. Goodbye. I must watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly she faced me again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you fear for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe met in another long look. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of answering she\r\ncame nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how he could see,\xe2\x80\x9d I meanwhile went on.\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long was he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill I came out. I came to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither could I!\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did come. I have my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; after which she added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been dying to tell you. But he\xe2\x80\x99s like nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has no hat.\xe2\x80\x9d Then seeing in her face that she already, in this,\r\nwith a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke\r\nto stroke. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face,\r\nlong in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer\r\nwhiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow,\r\ndarker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good\r\ndeal. His eyes are sharp, strange\xe2\x80\x94awfully; but I only know clearly that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re rather small and very fixed. His mouth\xe2\x80\x99s wide, and his lips are\r\nthin, and except for his little whiskers he\xe2\x80\x99s quite clean-shaven. He\r\ngives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn actor!\xe2\x80\x9d It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs.\r\nGrose at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He\xe2\x80\x99s tall, active, erect,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut never\xe2\x80\x94no, never!\xe2\x80\x94a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy companion\xe2\x80\x99s face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started\r\nand her mild mouth gaped. \xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, confounded,\r\nstupefied: \xe2\x80\x9ca gentleman _he?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe visibly tried to hold herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he _is_ handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the way to help her. \xe2\x80\x9cRemarkably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dressed\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn somebody\xe2\x80\x99s clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re smart, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke into a breathless affirmative groan: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the master\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI caught it up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faltered but a second. \xe2\x80\x9cQuint!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Quint\xe2\x80\x94his own man, his valet, when he was here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the master was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never\r\nwore his hat, but he did wear\xe2\x80\x94well, there were waistcoats missed. They\r\nwere both here\xe2\x80\x94last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed, but halting a little. \xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone with _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as from a deeper depth, \xe2\x80\x9cIn charge,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. \xe2\x80\x9cHe went, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe brought out at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWent where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer expression, at this, became extraordinary. \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows where! He\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDied?\xe2\x80\x9d I almost shrieked.\r\n\r\nShe seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter\r\nthe wonder of it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Mr. Quint is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt took of course more than that particular passage to place us\r\ntogether in presence of what we had now to live with as we could\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ndreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified,\r\nand my companion\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, henceforth\xe2\x80\x94a knowledge half consternation\r\nand half compassion\xe2\x80\x94of that liability. There had been, this evening,\r\nafter the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate\xe2\x80\x94there had been,\r\nfor either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of\r\ntears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of\r\nmutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our\r\nretreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there\r\nto have everything out. The result of our having everything out was\r\nsimply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She\r\nherself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the\r\nhouse but the governess was in the governess\xe2\x80\x99s plight; yet she accepted\r\nwithout directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and\r\nended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an\r\nexpression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of\r\nwhich the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of\r\nhuman charities.\r\n\r\nWhat was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we\r\nthought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in\r\nspite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I\r\nknew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable\r\nof meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly\r\nsure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so\r\ncompromising a contract. I was queer company enough\xe2\x80\x94quite as queer as\r\nthe company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see\r\nhow much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good\r\nfortune, _could_ steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that\r\nled me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I\r\ncould take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could\r\njoin me. Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to\r\nme before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every\r\nfeature of what I had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was looking for someone else, you say\xe2\x80\x94someone who was not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was looking for little Miles.\xe2\x80\x9d A portentous clearness now possessed\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ whom he was looking for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d My exaltation grew. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _you_ know, my\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling\r\nas that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if _he_ should see\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Miles? That\xe2\x80\x99s what he wants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked immensely scared again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d That he might\r\nwas an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay;\r\nwhich, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in\r\npractically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see\r\nagain what I had already seen, but something within me said that by\r\noffering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by\r\naccepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an\r\nexpiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The\r\nchildren, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I\r\nrecall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up. \xe2\x80\x9cHis having been here\r\nand the time they were with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history,\r\nin any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the little lady doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember. She never heard or knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances of his death?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought with some intensity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. But Miles would remember\xe2\x80\x94Miles would know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t try him!\xe2\x80\x9d broke from Mrs. Grose.\r\n\r\nI returned her the look she had given me. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncontinued to think. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ rather odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he has never spoken of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever by the least allusion. And you tell me they were \xe2\x80\x98great\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _him!_\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nQuint\xe2\x80\x99s own fancy. To play with him, I mean\xe2\x80\x94to spoil him.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a\r\nmoment; then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cQuint was much too free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis gave me, straight from my vision of his face\xe2\x80\x94_such_ a face!\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsudden sickness of disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cToo free with _my_ boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo free with everyone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by\r\nthe reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of\r\nthe household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our\r\nsmall colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the\r\nlucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions,\r\nhad ever, within anyone\xe2\x80\x99s memory attached to the kind old place. It had\r\nneither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only\r\ndesired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the\r\nvery last thing of all, to the test. It was when, at midnight, she had\r\nher hand on the schoolroom door to take leave. \xe2\x80\x9cI have it from you\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94for it\xe2\x80\x99s of great importance\xe2\x80\x94that he was definitely and admittedly\r\nbad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not admittedly. _I_ knew it\xe2\x80\x94but the master didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you never told him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like tale-bearing\xe2\x80\x94he hated complaints. He was terribly\r\nshort with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to\r\n_him_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered with more?\xe2\x80\x9d This squared well enough with my\r\nimpressions of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very\r\nparticular perhaps about some of the company _he_ kept. All the same, I\r\npressed my interlocutress. \xe2\x80\x9cI promise you _I_ would have told!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt my discrimination. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf things that man could do. Quint was so clever\xe2\x80\x94he was so deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took this in still more than, probably, I showed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid\r\nof anything else? Not of his effect\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis effect?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they were not in mine!\xe2\x80\x9d she roundly and distressfully returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed\r\nnot to be well and the country air so good for him. So he had\r\neverything to say. Yes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she let me have it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceven about _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x94that creature?\xe2\x80\x9d I had to smother a kind of howl. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you could\r\nbear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t now!\xe2\x80\x9d And the poor woman burst into tears.\r\n\r\nA rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow\r\nthem; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back\r\ntogether to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night,\r\nI was, in the immediate later hours in especial\xe2\x80\x94for it may be imagined\r\nwhether I slept\xe2\x80\x94still haunted with the shadow of something she had not\r\ntold me. I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word Mrs.\r\nGrose had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was\r\nnot from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were\r\nfears. It seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s sun was high I had restlessly read into the fact before us\r\nalmost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more\r\ncruel occurrences. What they gave me above all was just the sinister\r\nfigure of the living man\xe2\x80\x94the dead one would keep awhile!\xe2\x80\x94and of the\r\nmonths he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a\r\nformidable stretch. The limit of this evil time had arrived only when,\r\non the dawn of a winter\xe2\x80\x99s morning, Peter Quint was found, by a laborer\r\ngoing to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a\r\ncatastrophe explained\xe2\x80\x94superficially at least\xe2\x80\x94by a visible wound to his\r\nhead; such a wound as might have been produced\xe2\x80\x94and as, on the final\r\nevidence, _had_ been\xe2\x80\x94by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the\r\npublic house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at\r\nthe bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night\r\nand in liquor, accounted for much\xe2\x80\x94practically, in the end and after the\r\ninquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been\r\nmatters in his life\xe2\x80\x94strange passages and perils, secret disorders,\r\nvices more than suspected\xe2\x80\x94that would have accounted for a good deal\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible\r\npicture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to\r\nfind a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded\r\nof me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and\r\ndifficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen\xe2\x80\x94oh, in\r\nthe right quarter!\xe2\x80\x94that I could succeed where many another girl might\r\nhave failed. It was an immense help to me\xe2\x80\x94I confess I rather applaud\r\nmyself as I look back!\xe2\x80\x94that I saw my service so strongly and so simply.\r\nI was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the\r\nmost bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness\r\nhad suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united\r\nin our danger. They had nothing but me, and I\xe2\x80\x94well, I had _them_. It\r\nwas in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me\r\nin an image richly material. I was a screen\xe2\x80\x94I was to stand before them.\r\nThe more I saw, the less they would. I began to watch them in a stifled\r\nsuspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too\r\nlong, have turned to something like madness. What saved me, as I now\r\nsee, was that it turned to something else altogether. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t last as\r\nsuspense\xe2\x80\x94it was superseded by horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nthe moment I really took hold.\r\n\r\nThis moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in\r\nthe grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles\r\nindoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to\r\nfinish a book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable\r\nin a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the\r\nrestless. His sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and\r\nI strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was\r\nstill high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with\r\nher, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived\xe2\x80\x94it was the\r\ncharming thing in both children\xe2\x80\x94to let me alone without appearing to\r\ndrop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were\r\nnever importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all\r\nreally went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this\r\nwas a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as\r\nan active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention\xe2\x80\x94they had no\r\noccasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only\r\nwith being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of\r\nthe moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my\r\nexalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what\r\nI was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something\r\nvery important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We\r\nwere on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography,\r\nthe lake was the Sea of Azof.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other\r\nside of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this\r\nknowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstrangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly\r\nmerged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work\xe2\x80\x94for I was something\r\nor other that could sit\xe2\x80\x94on the old stone bench which overlooked the\r\npond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet\r\nwithout direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person.\r\nThe old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade,\r\nbut it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour.\r\nThere was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the\r\nconviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what\r\nI should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of\r\nraising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching\r\nin which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort\r\nnot to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to\r\nmake up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view\xe2\x80\x94a figure\r\nwhose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I\r\nrecollect counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself\r\nthat nothing was more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one\r\nof the men about the place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a\r\ntradesman\xe2\x80\x99s boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect\r\non my practical certitude as I was conscious\xe2\x80\x94still even without\r\nlooking\xe2\x80\x94of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor.\r\nNothing was more natural than that these things should be the other\r\nthings that they absolutely were not.\r\n\r\nOf the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as\r\nsoon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right\r\nsecond; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I\r\ntransferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was\r\nabout ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the\r\nwonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held\r\nmy breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden\r\ninnocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited,\r\nbut nothing came; then, in the first place\xe2\x80\x94and there is something more\r\ndire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\ndetermined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had\r\npreviously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also\r\nwithin the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the water.\r\nThis was her attitude when I at last looked at her\xe2\x80\x94looked with the\r\nconfirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct\r\npersonal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which\r\nhappened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to\r\nher the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a\r\nmast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, as I watched her,\r\nshe was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place.\r\nMy apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some\r\nseconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfaced what I had to face.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nI got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give\r\nno intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still\r\nhear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\n_know_\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too monstrous: they know, they know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what on earth\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d I felt her incredulity as she held me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, all that _we_ know\xe2\x80\x94and heaven knows what else besides!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as\r\nshe released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now\r\nwith full coherency even to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo hours ago, in the garden\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncould scarce articulate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFlora _saw!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhas told you?\xe2\x80\x9d she panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of\r\neight, _that_ child!\xe2\x80\x9d Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose, of course, could only gape the wider. \xe2\x80\x9cThen how do you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there\xe2\x80\x94I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean aware of _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94of _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d I was conscious as I spoke that I looked prodigious\r\nthings, for I got the slow reflection of them in my companion\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother person\xe2\x80\x94this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror\r\nand evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful\xe2\x80\x94with such an air also,\r\nand such a face!\xe2\x80\x94on the other side of the lake. I was there with the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCame how\xe2\x80\x94from where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom where they come from! She just appeared and stood there\xe2\x80\x94but not\r\nso near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd without coming nearer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. \xe2\x80\x9cWas she someone\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But someone the child has. Someone _you_ have.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, to show how\r\nI had thought it all out: \xe2\x80\x9cMy predecessor\xe2\x80\x94the one who died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jessel. You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d I pressed.\r\n\r\nShe turned right and left in her distress. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen ask Flora\xe2\x80\x94_she\xe2\x80\x99s_ sure!\xe2\x80\x9d But I had no sooner spoken than I caught\r\nmyself up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, _don\xe2\x80\x99t!_ She\xe2\x80\x99ll say she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, how\r\n_can_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m clear. Flora doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only then to spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see\r\nin it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ see\xe2\x80\x94what I _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ fear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of seeing\r\nher again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94now!\xe2\x80\x9d Then I explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of _not_ seeing\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut my companion only looked wan. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the child may keep it up\xe2\x80\x94and that the child assuredly\r\n_will_\xe2\x80\x94without my knowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet\r\npresently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force\r\nof the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to\r\ngive way to. \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear\xe2\x80\x94we must keep our heads! And after all, if she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d She even tried a grim joke. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she likes it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikes _such_ things\xe2\x80\x94a scrap of an infant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?\xe2\x80\x9d my friend bravely\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nShe brought me, for the instant, almost round. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we must clutch at\r\n_that_\xe2\x80\x94we must cling to it! If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a proof of what you say, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nproof of\xe2\x80\x94God knows what! For the woman\xe2\x80\x99s a horror of horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at\r\nlast raising them, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you admit it\xe2\x80\x99s what she was?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you know,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend simply repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow? By seeing her! By the way she looked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt you, do you mean\xe2\x80\x94so wickedly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, no\xe2\x80\x94I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She\r\nonly fixed the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose tried to see it. \xe2\x80\x9cFixed her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, with such awful eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nmean of dislike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help us, no. Of something much worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than dislike?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this left her indeed at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a determination\xe2\x80\x94indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made her turn pale. \xe2\x80\x9cIntention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get hold of her.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x94her eyes just lingering on mine\xe2\x80\x94gave a\r\nshudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out\r\nI completed my statement. \xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ what Flora knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little she turned round. \xe2\x80\x9cThe person was in black, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn mourning\xe2\x80\x94rather poor, almost shabby. But\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94with extraordinary\r\nbeauty.\xe2\x80\x9d I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke,\r\nbrought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed\r\nthis. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, handsome\xe2\x80\x94very, very,\xe2\x80\x9d I insisted; \xe2\x80\x9cwonderfully handsome. But\r\ninfamous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slowly came back to me. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jessel\xe2\x80\x94_was_ infamous.\xe2\x80\x9d She once more\r\ntook my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me\r\nagainst the increase of alarm I might draw from this disclosure. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwere both infamous,\xe2\x80\x9d she finally said.\r\n\r\nSo, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found\r\nabsolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nappreciate,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great decency of your not having hitherto\r\nspoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which\r\nI went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was\r\nsomething between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of the difference\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of their rank, their condition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she brought it woefully out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She_ was a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned it over; I again saw. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94she was a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he so dreadfully below,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grose.\r\n\r\nI felt that I doubtless needn\xe2\x80\x99t press too hard, in such company, on the\r\nplace of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an\r\nacceptance of my companion\xe2\x80\x99s own measure of my predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s abasement.\r\nThere was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for my\r\nfull vision\xe2\x80\x94on the evidence\xe2\x80\x94of our employer\xe2\x80\x99s late clever, good-looking\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fellow was a\r\nhound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense\r\nof shades. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one like him. He did what he wished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if now in my friend\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes Miss Jessel had again\r\nappeared. I seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation\r\nof her as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out\r\nwith decision: \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been also what _she_ wished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at\r\nthe same time: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman\xe2\x80\x94she paid for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do know what she died of?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I know nothing. I wanted not to know; I was glad enough I didn\xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nand I thanked heaven she was well out of this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you had, then, your idea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94as to that. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nstayed. Fancy it here\xe2\x80\x94for a governess! And afterward I imagined\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nstill imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so dreadful as what _I_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; on which I must have shown\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94as I was indeed but too conscious\xe2\x80\x94a front of miserable defeat. It\r\nbrought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch\r\nof her kindness my power to resist broke down. I burst, as I had, the\r\nother time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly\r\nbreast, and my lamentation overflowed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d I sobbed in\r\ndespair; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t save or shield them! It\xe2\x80\x99s far worse than I\r\ndreamed\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWhat I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter\r\nI had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution\r\nto sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of\r\na common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We\r\nwere to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else\xe2\x80\x94difficult indeed\r\nas that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was\r\nleast to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had\r\nanother talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its\r\nbeing beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her\r\nperfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cmade it up,\xe2\x80\x9d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons\r\nappearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their\r\nspecial marks\xe2\x80\x94a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly\r\nrecognized and named them. She wished of course\xe2\x80\x94small blame to her!\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nsink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own\r\ninterest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way\r\nto escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability\r\nthat with recurrence\xe2\x80\x94for recurrence we took for granted\xe2\x80\x94I should get\r\nused to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had\r\nsuddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion\r\nthat was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours\r\nof the day had brought a little ease.\r\n\r\nOn leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my\r\npupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of\r\ntheir charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively\r\ncultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other\r\nwords, plunged afresh into Flora\xe2\x80\x99s special society and there become\r\naware\xe2\x80\x94it was almost a luxury!\xe2\x80\x94that she could put her little conscious\r\nhand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet\r\nspeculation and then had accused me to my face of having \xe2\x80\x9ccried.\xe2\x80\x9d I had\r\nsupposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe time, at all events\xe2\x80\x94rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that\r\nthey had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of\r\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature\r\ncunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I\r\nnaturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my\r\nagitation. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat\r\nto Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x94as I did there, over and over, in the small hours\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwith their voices in the air, their pressure on one\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and their\r\nfragrant faces against one\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, everything fell to the ground but\r\ntheir incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to\r\nsettle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of\r\nsubtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my\r\nshow of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate\r\nthe certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as\r\na revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a\r\nmatter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have\r\nhad to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion,\r\nso much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I\r\nactually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much\r\nas she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and at the same\r\ntime, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I\r\nmyself did! It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the\r\nportentous little activity by which she sought to divert my\r\nattention\xe2\x80\x94the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity\r\nof play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to\r\nromp.\r\n\r\nYet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this\r\nreview, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort\r\nthat still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to\r\nasseverate to my friend that I was certain\xe2\x80\x94which was so much to the\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x94that _I_ at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been\r\nprompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind\xe2\x80\x94I scarce know what\r\nto call it\xe2\x80\x94to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring\r\nfrom pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by\r\nbit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong\r\nside of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat;\r\nand I remember how on this occasion\xe2\x80\x94for the sleeping house and the\r\nconcentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help\xe2\x80\x94I felt\r\nthe importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nanything so horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d I recollect saying; \xe2\x80\x9cno, let us put it\r\ndefinitely, my dear, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t. But if I did, you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94oh, not a scrap, come!\xe2\x80\x94to get out of you. What was it you had in\r\nmind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, over the letter\r\nfrom his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nfor him that he had not literally _ever_ been \xe2\x80\x98bad\xe2\x80\x99? He has _not_\r\nliterally \xe2\x80\x98ever,\xe2\x80\x99 in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and\r\nso closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of\r\ndelightful, lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made\r\nthe claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to\r\ntake. What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal\r\nobservation of him did you refer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and,\r\nat any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got\r\nmy answer. What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the\r\npurpose. It was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a\r\nperiod of several months Quint and the boy had been perpetually\r\ntogether. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had\r\nventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so\r\nclose an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank\r\noverture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,\r\nrequested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,\r\ndirectly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I\r\npressed, was that _she_ liked to see young gentlemen not forget their\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nI pressed again, of course, at this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou reminded him that Quint was\r\nonly a base menial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for another thing?\xe2\x80\x9d I waited. \xe2\x80\x9cHe repeated your words to Quint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that. It\xe2\x80\x99s just what he _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!_\xe2\x80\x9d she could still impress\r\nupon me. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sure, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But he\r\ndenied certain occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat occasions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they had been about together quite as if Quint were his tutor\xe2\x80\x94and\r\na very grand one\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had\r\ngone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe then prevaricated about it\xe2\x80\x94he said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Her assent was clear\r\nenough to cause me to add in a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cI see. He lied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter;\r\nwhich indeed she backed up by a further remark. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, after all,\r\nMiss Jessel didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t forbid him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI considered. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he put that to you as a justification?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she dropped again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he never spoke of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mentioned her in connection with Quint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow anything. He denied,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated; \xe2\x80\x9che denied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord, how I pressed her now! \xe2\x80\x9cSo that you could see he knew what was\r\nbetween the two wretches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d the poor woman groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do know, you dear thing,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9conly you haven\xe2\x80\x99t my dreadful\r\nboldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and\r\ndelicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without\r\nmy aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable.\r\nBut I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in the boy that\r\nsuggested to you,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he covered and concealed their\r\nrelation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour learning the truth? I daresay! But, heavens,\xe2\x80\x9d I fell, with\r\nvehemence, athinking, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it shows that they must, to that extent,\r\nhave succeeded in making of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s not nice _now!_\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you looked queer,\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I mentioned to\r\nyou the letter from his school!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if I looked as queer as you!\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted with homely force.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed\xe2\x80\x94and if he was a fiend at school! How, how, how? Well,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid in my torment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must put it to me again, but I shall not be\r\nable to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me again!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried in a\r\nway that made my friend stare. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are directions in which I must\r\nnot for the present let myself go.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile I returned to her first\r\nexample\xe2\x80\x94the one to which she had just previously referred\xe2\x80\x94of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappy capacity for an occasional slip. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Quint\xe2\x80\x94on your remonstrance\r\nat the time you speak of\xe2\x80\x94was a base menial, one of the things Miles\r\nsaid to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.\xe2\x80\x9d Again\r\nher admission was so adequate that I continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you forgave him\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the\r\noddest amusement. Then I went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, while he was with the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it\r\nsuited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of\r\nforbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the\r\nexpression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light\r\non it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to\r\nMrs. Grose. \xe2\x80\x9cHis having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less\r\nengaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in\r\nhim of the little natural man. Still,\xe2\x80\x9d I mused, \xe2\x80\x9cThey must do, for they\r\nmake me feel more than ever that I must watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend\xe2\x80\x99s face how much\r\nmore unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as\r\npresenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came out\r\nwhen, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you don\xe2\x80\x99t accuse\r\n_him_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember\r\nthat, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, before\r\nshutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\njust wait,\xe2\x80\x9d I wound up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nI waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from\r\nmy consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant\r\nsight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to\r\ngrievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the\r\nsponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish\r\ngrace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if\r\nI neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would\r\nyield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to\r\nstruggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however,\r\na greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I\r\nused to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought\r\nstrange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only\r\nmade them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping\r\nthem in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they _were_ so\r\nimmensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events,\r\nas in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could\r\nonly be\xe2\x80\x94blameless and foredoomed as they were\xe2\x80\x94a reason the more for\r\ntaking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I\r\nfound myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as\r\nI had done so I used to say to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will they think of that?\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it betray too much?\xe2\x80\x9d It would have been easy to get into a sad,\r\nwild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I\r\nfeel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the\r\nimmediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even\r\nunder the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it\r\noccurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little\r\noutbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering\r\nif I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\nThey were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me;\r\nwhich, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response\r\nin children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they\r\nwere so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if\r\nI never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a\r\npurpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for\r\ntheir poor protectress; I mean\xe2\x80\x94though they got their lessons better and\r\nbetter, which was naturally what would please her most\xe2\x80\x94in the way of\r\ndiverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling\r\nher stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as\r\nanimals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpieces\xe2\x80\x9d they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite.\r\nI should never get to the bottom\xe2\x80\x94were I to let myself go even now\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthe prodigious private commentary, all under still more private\r\ncorrection, with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours.\r\nThey had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general\r\nfaculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They\r\ngot their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the\r\nmere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of\r\nmemory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as\r\nShakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the\r\ncase that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at\r\nthe present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude\r\nto my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles.\r\nWhat I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the\r\nquestion, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his\r\nperpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad\r\ngoverness, for a parson\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not\r\nthe brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the\r\nimpression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was\r\nunder some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a\r\ntremendous incitement.\r\n\r\nIf it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone\r\nschool, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckicked out\xe2\x80\x9d by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me\r\nadd that in their company now\xe2\x80\x94and I was careful almost never to be out\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music\r\nand love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each\r\nof the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a\r\nmarvelous knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano broke\r\ninto all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were\r\nconfabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in\r\nthe highest spirits in order to \xe2\x80\x9ccome in\xe2\x80\x9d as something new. I had had\r\nbrothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could\r\nbe slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that\r\nthere was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior\r\nage, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were\r\nextraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or\r\ncomplained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of\r\nsweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps\r\ncame across traces of little understandings between them by which one\r\nof them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is\r\na _na\xc3\xaff_ side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced\r\nupon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the\r\nother quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.\r\n\r\nI find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on\r\nwith the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the\r\nmost liberal faith\xe2\x80\x94for which I little care; but\xe2\x80\x94and this is another\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it\r\nto the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back,\r\nthe affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at\r\nleast reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is\r\ndoubtless to advance. One evening\xe2\x80\x94with nothing to lead up or to prepare\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the\r\nnight of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned,\r\nI should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent\r\nsojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a\r\ncouple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly\xe2\x80\x94last-century\r\nfiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated\r\nrenown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached\r\nthe sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my\r\nyouth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Amelia_; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general\r\nconviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to\r\nlooking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping,\r\nin the fashion of those days, the head of Flora\xe2\x80\x99s little bed, shrouded,\r\nas I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. I\r\nrecollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I\r\nfound myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered,\r\nlooking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. There was\r\na moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had\r\nhad, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the\r\nhouse, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the\r\nhalf-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must\r\nhave seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down\r\nmy book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of\r\nthe room and, from the passage, on which my light made little\r\nimpression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.\r\n\r\nI can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went\r\nstraight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within\r\nsight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the\r\nstaircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three\r\nthings. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of\r\nsuccession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I\r\nperceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest\r\nmorning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw\r\nthat there was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I\r\nrequired no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter\r\nwith Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was\r\ntherefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it\r\nstopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower\r\nand from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the\r\ncold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on\r\nthe polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common\r\nintensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,\r\ndangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve\r\nthis distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that\r\ndread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me\r\nthere that didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet and measure him.\r\n\r\nI had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had,\r\nthank God, no terror. And he knew I had not\xe2\x80\x94I found myself at the end\r\nof an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of\r\nconfidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\ntime, at least\xe2\x80\x94to have him to reckon with; and during the minute,\r\naccordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview:\r\nhideous just because it _was_ human, as human as to have met alone, in\r\nthe small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some\r\ncriminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close\r\nquarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of\r\nthe unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an\r\nhour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed,\r\nin life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved.\r\nThe moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to\r\nmake me doubt if even _I_ were in life. I can\xe2\x80\x99t express what followed\r\nit save by saying that the silence itself\xe2\x80\x94which was indeed in a manner\r\nan attestation of my strength\xe2\x80\x94became the element into which I saw the\r\nfigure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have\r\nseen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an\r\norder, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch\r\ncould have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the\r\ndarkness in which the next bend was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nI remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect\r\npresently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone:\r\nthen I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light\r\nof the candle I had left burning was that Flora\xe2\x80\x99s little bed was empty;\r\nand on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes\r\nbefore, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had\r\nleft her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the\r\nsheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled\r\nforward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering\r\nsound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child,\r\nducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there\r\nin so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink\r\nbare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave,\r\nand I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the\r\nthrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness\r\nthat she addressed me with a reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty: where _have_ you\r\nbeen?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself\r\narraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with\r\nthe loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay\r\nthere, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had\r\nbecome of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back\r\ninto my chair\xe2\x80\x94feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had\r\npattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given\r\nherself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful\r\nlittle face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing my\r\neyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of\r\nsomething beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were\r\nlooking for me out of the window?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I might be\r\nwalking in the grounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, I thought someone was\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she never blanched as she\r\nsmiled out that at me.\r\n\r\nOh, how I looked at her now! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you see anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _no!_\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish\r\ninconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her little\r\ndrawl of the negative.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she\r\nlied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the\r\nthree or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One of\r\nthese, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to\r\nwithstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that,\r\nwonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why\r\nnot break out at her on the spot and have it all over?\xe2\x80\x94give it to her\r\nstraight in her lovely little lighted face? \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, you see, you\r\n_know_ that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it;\r\ntherefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least\r\nlive with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our\r\nfate, where we are and what it means?\xe2\x80\x9d This solicitation dropped, alas,\r\nas it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have\r\nspared myself\xe2\x80\x94well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang\r\nagain to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were\r\nstill there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to frighten you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I had, by your idea, gone out\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame\r\nof the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as\r\nimpersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nquite adequately answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you might come back, you dear, and\r\nthat you _have!_\xe2\x80\x9d And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had,\r\nfor a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove\r\nthat I recognized the pertinence of my return.\r\n\r\nYou may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my nights.\r\nI repeatedly sat up till I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when; I selected moments when my\r\nroommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in\r\nthe passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met Quint.\r\nBut I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I\r\non no other occasion saw him in the house. I just missed, on the\r\nstaircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. Looking down it\r\nfrom the top I once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of\r\nthe lower steps with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and\r\nher head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands. I had been there but an\r\ninstant, however, when she vanished without looking round at me. I\r\nknew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I\r\nwondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should\r\nhave had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well,\r\nthere continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night\r\nafter my latest encounter with that gentleman\xe2\x80\x94they were all numbered\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the\r\nparticular quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest\r\nshock. It was precisely the first night during this series that, weary\r\nwith watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself\r\ndown at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till\r\nabout one o\xe2\x80\x99clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as\r\ncompletely roused as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light\r\nburning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that Flora\r\nhad extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in the\r\ndarkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the\r\nwindow enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\nThe child had again got up\xe2\x80\x94this time blowing out the taper, and had\r\nagain, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind\r\nthe blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw\xe2\x80\x94as she\r\nhad not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time\xe2\x80\x94was proved to me by\r\nthe fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the\r\nhaste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden, protected,\r\nabsorbed, she evidently rested on the sill\xe2\x80\x94the casement opened\r\nforward\xe2\x80\x94and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her,\r\nand this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face\r\nwith the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate\r\nwith it as she had not then been able to do. What I, on my side, had to\r\ncare for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some\r\nother window in the same quarter. I got to the door without her hearing\r\nme; I got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for\r\nsome sound from her. While I stood in the passage I had my eyes on her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably,\r\nproduced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of\r\nas my temptation. What if I should go straight in and march to _his_\r\nwindow?\xe2\x80\x94what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of\r\nmy motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long\r\nhalter of my boldness?\r\n\r\nThis thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and\r\npause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might\r\nportentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were\r\nsecretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which\r\nmy impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was\r\nhideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds\xe2\x80\x94a figure\r\nprowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it\r\nwas not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated afresh, but\r\non other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice.\r\nThere were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing\r\nthe right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the\r\nlower one\xe2\x80\x94though high above the gardens\xe2\x80\x94in the solid corner of the\r\nhouse that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square\r\nchamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of\r\nwhich made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by\r\nMrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it\r\nand I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the\r\nfirst chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as\r\nquietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I\r\nuncovered the glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane,\r\nwas able, the darkness without being much less than within, to see that\r\nI commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon\r\nmade the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a\r\nperson, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if\r\nfascinated, looking up to where I had appeared\xe2\x80\x94looking, that is, not so\r\nmuch straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. There\r\nwas clearly another person above me\xe2\x80\x94there was a person on the tower;\r\nbut the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived\r\nand had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn\xe2\x80\x94I felt\r\nsick as I made it out\xe2\x80\x94was poor little Miles himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIt was not till late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor\r\nwith which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet\r\nher privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not\r\nprovoking\xe2\x80\x94on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of\r\nmysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere\r\nsmooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others\r\nmy horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would have become of me, for I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to\r\nthe blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our\r\nlittle charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness\r\nand cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my\r\ntrouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she\r\nwould doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match\r\nthem; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed\r\nthem, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all\r\nher look, thank the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces\r\nwould still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a\r\nsteady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the\r\ndevelopment of the conviction that\xe2\x80\x94as time went on without a public\r\naccident\xe2\x80\x94our young things could, after all, look out for themselves,\r\nshe addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by\r\ntheir instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I\r\ncould engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it\r\nwould have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find\r\nmyself anxious about hers.\r\n\r\nAt the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the\r\nterrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now\r\nagreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance,\r\nbut within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one\r\nof their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us,\r\nover the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook\r\nand passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs.\r\nGrose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the\r\nsuppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to\r\ntake from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a\r\nreceptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my\r\nsuperiority\xe2\x80\x94my accomplishments and my function\xe2\x80\x94in her patience under my\r\npain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a\r\nwitch\xe2\x80\x99s broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a\r\nlarge clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the\r\ntime that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the\r\npoint of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a\r\nmonstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I\r\nhad gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a\r\nconcentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a\r\nsignal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my\r\nsmall hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my\r\nsense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after\r\nI had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate\r\nchallenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he\r\nhad come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand\r\nwithout a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase\r\nwhere Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I\r\nhad listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.\r\n\r\nNot a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\n_how_ I had wondered!\xe2\x80\x94if he were groping about in his little mind for\r\nsomething plausible and not too grotesque. It would tax his invention,\r\ncertainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a\r\ncurious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get\r\nout of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this\r\nquestion an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _I_ should. I was\r\nconfronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now\r\nto sounding my own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed\r\ninto his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and\r\nthe window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that\r\nthere was no need of striking a match\xe2\x80\x94I remember how I suddenly\r\ndropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that\r\nhe must know how he really, as they say, \xe2\x80\x9chad\xe2\x80\x9d me. He could do what he\r\nliked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should\r\ncontinue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those\r\ncaretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chad\xe2\x80\x9d me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me,\r\nwho would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor\r\nof an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect\r\nintercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to\r\nconvey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to\r\nsuggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly\r\nshook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful;\r\nnever, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such\r\ntenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held\r\nhim there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form at least,\r\nto put it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell me now\xe2\x80\x94and all the truth. What did you go out for? What\r\nwere you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes,\r\nand the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\ntell you why, will you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d My heart, at this, leaped into my\r\nmouth. _Would_ he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press it,\r\nand I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod.\r\nHe was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood\r\nthere more than ever a little fairy prince. It was his brightness\r\nindeed that gave me a respite. Would it be so great if he were really\r\ngoing to tell me? \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cjust exactly in order that\r\nyou should do this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink me\xe2\x80\x94for a change\xe2\x80\x94_bad!_\xe2\x80\x9d I shall never forget the sweetness and\r\ngaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he\r\nbent forward and kissed me. It was practically the end of everything. I\r\nmet his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my\r\narms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly the\r\naccount of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it\r\nwas only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I\r\npresently glanced about the room, I could say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you didn\xe2\x80\x99t undress at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fairly glittered in the gloom. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I sat up and read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when did you go down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt midnight. When I\xe2\x80\x99m bad I _am_ bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s charming. But how could you be sure I would know\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I arranged that with Flora.\xe2\x80\x9d His answers rang out with a\r\nreadiness! \xe2\x80\x9cShe was to get up and look out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is what she did do.\xe2\x80\x9d It was I who fell into the trap!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also\r\nlooked\xe2\x80\x94you saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile you,\xe2\x80\x9d I concurred, \xe2\x80\x9ccaught your death in the night air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford\r\nradiantly to assent. \xe2\x80\x9cHow otherwise should I have been bad enough?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview\r\nclosed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his\r\njoke, he had been able to draw upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe particular impression I had received proved in the morning light, I\r\nrepeat, not quite successfully presentable to Mrs. Grose, though I\r\nreinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made\r\nbefore we separated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt all lies in half a dozen words,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cwords that really settle the matter. \xe2\x80\x98Think, you know, what I\r\n_might_ do!\xe2\x80\x99 He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down\r\nto the ground what he \xe2\x80\x98might\xe2\x80\x99 do. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he gave them a taste of\r\nat school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, you do change!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t change\xe2\x80\x94I simply make it out. The four, depend upon it,\r\nperpetually meet. If on either of these last nights you had been with\r\neither child, you would clearly have understood. The more I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched\r\nand waited the more I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt that if there were nothing else to make\r\nit sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. _Never_,\r\nby a slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of\r\ntheir old friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his expulsion.\r\nOh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us\r\nthere to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their\r\nfairytale they\xe2\x80\x99re steeped in their vision of the dead restored. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot reading to her,\xe2\x80\x9d I declared; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re talking of _them_\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntalking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen would have made _you_ so; but it has only made\r\nme more lucid, made me get hold of still other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lucidity must have seemed awful, but the charming creatures who were\r\nvictims of it, passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness,\r\ngave my colleague something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she\r\nheld as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she covered them\r\nstill with her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what other things have you got hold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at\r\nbottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their\r\nmore than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngame,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a policy and a fraud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the part of little darlings\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!\xe2\x80\x9d The very act of\r\nbringing it out really helped me to trace it\xe2\x80\x94follow it all up and piece\r\nit all together. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t been good\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve only been absent. It\r\nhas been easy to live with them, because they\xe2\x80\x99re simply leading a life\r\nof their own. They\xe2\x80\x99re not mine\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re not ours. They\xe2\x80\x99re his and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re hers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuint\xe2\x80\x99s and that woman\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuint\xe2\x80\x99s and that woman\xe2\x80\x99s. They want to get to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to study them! \xe2\x80\x9cBut for\r\nwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair\r\nput into them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the\r\nwork of demons, is what brings the others back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws!\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend under her breath. The exclamation was homely,\r\nbut it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the\r\nbad time\xe2\x80\x94for there had been a worse even than this!\xe2\x80\x94must have occurred.\r\nThere could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent\r\nof her experience to whatever depth of depravity I found credible in\r\nour brace of scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of memory that\r\nshe brought out after a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cThey _were_ rascals! But what can they\r\nnow do?\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d I echoed so loud that Miles and Flora, as they passed at their\r\ndistance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ndo enough?\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having\r\nsmiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. We\r\nwere held by it a minute; then I answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThey can destroy them!\xe2\x80\x9d At\r\nthis my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent\r\none, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow, as yet, quite how\xe2\x80\x94but they\xe2\x80\x99re trying hard. They\xe2\x80\x99re seen only\r\nacross, as it were, and beyond\xe2\x80\x94in strange places and on high places,\r\nthe top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside of windows, the\r\nfurther edge of pools; but there\xe2\x80\x99s a deep design, on either side, to\r\nshorten the distance and overcome the obstacle; and the success of the\r\ntempters is only a question of time. They\xe2\x80\x99ve only to keep to their\r\nsuggestions of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the children to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perish in the attempt!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose slowly got up, and I\r\nscrupulously added: \xe2\x80\x9cUnless, of course, we can prevent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanding there before me while I kept my seat, she visibly turned\r\nthings over. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir uncle must do the preventing. He must take them\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\xe2\x80\x99s to make him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and\r\nniece mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they _are_, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I am myself, you mean? That\xe2\x80\x99s charming news to be sent him by a\r\ngoverness whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose considered, following the children again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he do hate\r\nworry. That was the great reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his\r\nindifference must have been awful. As I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fiend, at any rate, I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and\r\ngrasped my arm. \xe2\x80\x9cMake him at any rate come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stared. \xe2\x80\x9cTo _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d I had a sudden fear of what she might do. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Him\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to _be_ here\xe2\x80\x94he ought to help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her a queerer face than\r\never yet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see me asking him for a visit?\xe2\x80\x9d No, with her eyes on my\r\nface she evidently couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Instead of it even\xe2\x80\x94as a woman reads\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94she could see what I myself saw: his derision, his amusement,\r\nhis contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone\r\nand for the fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his attention\r\nto my slighted charms. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94no one knew\xe2\x80\x94how proud I had been\r\nto serve him and to stick to our terms; yet she nonetheless took the\r\nmeasure, I think, of the warning I now gave her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you should so lose\r\nyour head as to appeal to him for me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was really frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would leave, on the spot, both him and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as\r\nmuch as ever an effort beyond my strength\xe2\x80\x94offered, in close quarters,\r\ndifficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued a\r\nmonth, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note above\r\nall, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part\r\nof my pupils. It was not, I am as sure today as I was sure then, my\r\nmere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were\r\naware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a\r\nmanner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that\r\nthey had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that\r\nwas not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the\r\nelement of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than\r\nany other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so\r\nsuccessfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement. It was\r\nas if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects\r\nbefore which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we\r\nperceived to be blind, closing with a little bang that made us look at\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x94for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had\r\nintended\xe2\x80\x94the doors we had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to Rome,\r\nand there were times when it might have struck us that almost every\r\nbranch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground.\r\nForbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general\r\nand of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends\r\nlittle children had lost. There were days when I could have sworn that\r\none of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nthinks she\xe2\x80\x99ll do it this time\xe2\x80\x94but she _won\xe2\x80\x99t!_\xe2\x80\x9d To \xe2\x80\x9cdo it\xe2\x80\x9d would have\r\nbeen to indulge for instance\xe2\x80\x94and for once in a way\xe2\x80\x94in some direct\r\nreference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had\r\na delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which\r\nI had again and again treated them; they were in possession of\r\neverything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every\r\ncircumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my\r\nbrothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as\r\nmany particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture\r\nand arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women\r\nof our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to\r\nchatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go\r\nround. They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention\r\nand my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when I thought of such\r\noccasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watched from\r\nunder cover. It was in any case over _my_ life, _my_ past, and _my_\r\nfriends alone that we could take anything like our ease\xe2\x80\x94a state of\r\naffairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break\r\nout into sociable reminders. I was invited\xe2\x80\x94with no visible\r\nconnection\xe2\x80\x94to repeat afresh Goody Gosling\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated _mot_ or to\r\nconfirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the\r\nvicarage pony.\r\n\r\nIt was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different\r\nones that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I\r\nhave called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for\r\nme without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have\r\ndone something toward soothing my nerves. Since the light brush, that\r\nsecond night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the\r\nfoot of the stair, I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house,\r\nthat one had better not have seen. There was many a corner round which\r\nI expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely\r\nsinister way, would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel. The\r\nsummer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon Bly\r\nand had blown out half our lights. The place, with its gray sky and\r\nwithered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like\r\na theater after the performance\xe2\x80\x94all strewn with crumpled playbills.\r\nThere were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of\r\nstillness, unspeakable impressions of the _kind_ of ministering moment,\r\nthat brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the\r\nmedium in which, that June evening out of doors, I had had my first\r\nsight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had,\r\nafter seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the\r\ncircle of shrubbery. I recognized the signs, the portents\xe2\x80\x94I recognized\r\nthe moment, the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I\r\ncontinued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose\r\nsensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but\r\ndeepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene of\r\nFlora\xe2\x80\x99s by the lake\xe2\x80\x94and had perplexed her by so saying\xe2\x80\x94that it would\r\nfrom that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep\r\nit. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,\r\nwhether the children really saw or not\xe2\x80\x94since, that is, it was not yet\r\ndefinitely proved\xe2\x80\x94I greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of\r\nmy own exposure. I was ready to know the very worst that was to be\r\nknown. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be\r\nsealed just while theirs were most opened. Well, my eyes _were_ sealed,\r\nit appeared, at present\xe2\x80\x94a consummation for which it seemed blasphemous\r\nnot to thank God. There was, alas, a difficulty about that: I would\r\nhave thanked him with all my soul had I not had in a proportionate\r\nmeasure this conviction of the secret of my pupils.\r\n\r\nHow can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? There were\r\ntimes of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that,\r\nliterally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they\r\nhad visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that, had I\r\nnot been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove\r\ngreater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re here, they\xe2\x80\x99re here, you little wretches,\xe2\x80\x9d I would have\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cand you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it now!\xe2\x80\x9d The little wretches denied it with\r\nall the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just\r\nthe crystal depths of which\xe2\x80\x94like the flash of a fish in a stream\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk\r\ninto me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see\r\neither Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over\r\nwhose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nstraightway, there, turned it on me\xe2\x80\x94the lovely upward look with which,\r\nfrom the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had\r\nplayed. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion\r\nhad scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of\r\nnerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed\r\nme so that sometimes, at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly to\r\nrehearse\xe2\x80\x94it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmanner in which I might come to the point. I approached it from one\r\nside and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I\r\nalways broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died\r\naway on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to\r\nrepresent something infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate\r\nas rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom,\r\nprobably, had ever known. When I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ have the\r\nmanners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness to\r\nspeak!\xe2\x80\x9d I felt myself crimson and I covered my face with my hands.\r\nAfter these secret scenes I chattered more than ever, going on volubly\r\nenough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes occurred\xe2\x80\x94I can call\r\nthem nothing else\xe2\x80\x94the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!)\r\ninto a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the\r\nmore or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and\r\nthat I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened\r\nrecitation or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that the others,\r\nthe outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they \xe2\x80\x9cpassed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the\r\nfear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more\r\ninfernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough\r\nfor myself.\r\n\r\nWhat it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,\r\nwhatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw _more_\xe2\x80\x94things terrible and\r\nunguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in\r\nthe past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a\r\nchill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three,\r\nwith repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each\r\ntime, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through\r\nthe very same movements. It was striking of the children, at all\r\nevents, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and\r\nnever to fail\xe2\x80\x94one or the other\xe2\x80\x94of the precious question that had helped\r\nus through many a peril. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you think he _will_ come? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink we _ought_ to write?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing like that inquiry, we\r\nfound by experience, for carrying off an awkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x9d of course\r\nwas their uncle in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of\r\ntheory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It\r\nwas impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to\r\nsuch a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon\r\nwe should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions.\r\nHe never wrote to them\xe2\x80\x94that may have been selfish, but it was a part of\r\nthe flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his\r\nhighest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal\r\ncelebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I\r\ncarried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when I\r\nlet my charges understand that their own letters were but charming\r\nliterary exercises. They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them\r\nmyself; I have them all to this hour. This was a rule indeed which only\r\nadded to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that\r\nhe might at any moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges\r\nknew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me.\r\nThere appears to me, moreover, as I look back, no note in all this more\r\nextraordinary than the mere fact that, in spite of my tension and of\r\ntheir triumph, I never lost patience with them. Adorable they must in\r\ntruth have been, I now reflect, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t in these days hate them!\r\nWould exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed,\r\nfinally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived. I call\r\nit relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain\r\nor the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at least\r\nchange, and it came with a rush.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nWalking to church a certain Sunday morning, I had little Miles at my\r\nside and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s, well in\r\nsight. It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time;\r\nthe night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and\r\nsharp, made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd accident of\r\nthought that I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly\r\nand very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why\r\ndid they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or\r\nother had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy\r\nto my shawl and that, in the way our companions were marshaled before\r\nme, I might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion.\r\nI was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. But\r\nall this belonged\xe2\x80\x94I mean their magnificent little surrender\xe2\x80\x94just to the\r\nspecial array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for\r\nSunday by his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of\r\npretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles\xe2\x80\x99s whole title to\r\nindependence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon\r\nhim that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had\r\nnothing to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I\r\nshould meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a\r\nrevolution because I now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain\r\nrose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was\r\nprecipitated. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, my dear, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he charmingly said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nin the world, please, am I going back to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTranscribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly as\r\nuttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all\r\ninterlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off\r\nintonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them\r\nthat always made one \xe2\x80\x9ccatch,\xe2\x80\x9d and I caught, at any rate, now so\r\neffectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park\r\nhad fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot,\r\nbetween us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though, to\r\nenable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and\r\ncharming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my at\r\nfirst finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained.\r\nI was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a\r\nminute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady _always_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d His \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x9d was constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have\r\nexpressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to\r\ninspire my pupils than its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nBut, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I\r\nremember that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see in\r\nthe beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer I\r\nlooked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd always with the same lady?\xe2\x80\x9d I returned.\r\n\r\nHe neither blanched nor winked. The whole thing was virtually out\r\nbetween us. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, of course, she\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly, \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 lady; but, after\r\nall, I\xe2\x80\x99m a fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? that\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94well, getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngetting on.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, but I felt helpless!\r\n\r\nI have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed\r\nto know that and to play with it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been\r\nawfully good, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it\r\nwould have been to walk on, I was not yet quite able. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nthat, Miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept just that one night, you know\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one night?\xe2\x80\x9d I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look as straight as he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when I went down\xe2\x80\x94went out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish\r\nreproach. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it was to show you I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits\r\nabout me. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not _that_ again. It was nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThen when\r\n_am_ I going back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you very\r\nhappy at school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe just considered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy enough anywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I quavered, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re just as happy here\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything! Of course _you_ know a lot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you hint that you know almost as much?\xe2\x80\x9d I risked as he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot half I want to!\xe2\x80\x9d Miles honestly professed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I want to see more life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see; I see.\xe2\x80\x9d We had arrived within sight of the church and of\r\nvarious persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their\r\nway to it and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened our\r\nstep; I wanted to get there before the question between us opened up\r\nmuch further; I reflected hungrily that, for more than an hour, he\r\nwould have to be silent; and I thought with envy of the comparative\r\ndusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on\r\nwhich I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race\r\nwith some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that\r\nhe had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he\r\nthrew out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my own sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt literally made me bound forward. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are not many of your own\r\nsort, Miles!\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless perhaps dear little Flora!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really compare me to a baby girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis found me singularly weak. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you, then, _love_ our sweet\r\nFlora?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and you, too; if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated as if retreating\r\nfor a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had\r\ncome into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the\r\npressure of his arm, had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had\r\npassed into the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we\r\nwere, for the minute, alone among the old, thick graves. We had paused,\r\non the path from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike tomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked, while I waited, at the graves. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know what!\xe2\x80\x9d But he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t move, and he presently produced something that made me drop\r\nstraight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes my uncle\r\nthink what _you_ think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI markedly rested. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know what I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t; for it strikes me you never tell me. But\r\nI mean does _he_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow what, Miles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the way I\xe2\x80\x99m going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no\r\nanswer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer.\r\nYet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed\r\nto make that venial. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think your uncle much cares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiles, on this, stood looking at me. \xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he can be\r\nmade to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, by his coming down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who\xe2\x80\x99ll get him to come down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ will!\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He\r\ngave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off\r\nalone into church.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nThe business was practically settled from the moment I never followed\r\nhim. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of\r\nthis had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb\r\nand read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its\r\nmeaning; by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also\r\nembraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my\r\npupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What\r\nI said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me\r\nand that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse.\r\nHe had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and\r\nthat he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his\r\nown purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the\r\nintolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for\r\nthat was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. That\r\nhis uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution\r\nthat, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I\r\ncould so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply\r\nprocrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my deep\r\ndiscomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to\r\nme: \xe2\x80\x9cEither you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this\r\ninterruption of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you\r\na life that\xe2\x80\x99s so unnatural for a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d What was so unnatural for the\r\nparticular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a\r\nconsciousness and a plan.\r\n\r\nThat was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked\r\nround the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already,\r\nwith him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up\r\nnothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into\r\nthe pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into\r\nmine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with\r\nhis commentary on our talk. For the first minute since his arrival I\r\nwanted to get away from him. As I paused beneath the high east window\r\nand listened to the sounds of worship, I was taken with an impulse that\r\nmight master me, I felt, completely should I give it the least\r\nencouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting\r\naway altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I\r\ncould give the whole thing up\xe2\x80\x94turn my back and retreat. It was only a\r\nquestion of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which\r\nthe attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically\r\nhave left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just\r\ndrive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till\r\ndinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\nthe acute prevision\xe2\x80\x94my little pupils would play at innocent wonder\r\nabout my nonappearance in their train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _did_ you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry\r\nus so\xe2\x80\x94and take our thoughts off, too, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x94did you desert us\r\nat the very door?\xe2\x80\x9d I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet such questions nor, as they asked\r\nthem, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what I\r\nshould have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last\r\nlet myself go.\r\n\r\nI got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came\r\nstraight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps\r\nthrough the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house\r\nI had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the\r\napproaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited\r\nme with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I\r\nshould get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have\r\nto be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the\r\ngreat one to settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and\r\nobstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the\r\nstaircase\xe2\x80\x94suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a\r\nrevulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more than a month\r\nbefore, in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I\r\nhad seen the specter of the most horrible of women. At this I was able\r\nto straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my\r\nbewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to\r\nme that I should have to take. But I opened the door to find again, in\r\na flash, my eyes unsealed. In the presence of what I saw I reeled\r\nstraight back upon my resistance.\r\n\r\nSeated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom,\r\nwithout my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush\r\nfor some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the\r\nplace and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of\r\nthe schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself\r\nto the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an\r\neffort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands\r\nwith evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took\r\nthis in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her\r\nattitude strangely persisted. Then it was\xe2\x80\x94with the very act of its\r\nannouncing itself\xe2\x80\x94that her identity flared up in a change of posture.\r\nShe rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand\r\nmelancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of\r\nme, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was\r\nall before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the\r\nawful image passed away. Dark as midnight in her black dress, her\r\nhaggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long\r\nenough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good\r\nas mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the\r\nextraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It\r\nwas as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nterrible, miserable woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I heard myself break into a sound that, by\r\nthe open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. She\r\nlooked at me as if she heard me, but I had recovered myself and cleared\r\nthe air. There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine\r\nand a sense that I must stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nI had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be\r\nmarked by a demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take\r\ninto account that they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily\r\ndenouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion to my having failed\r\nthem, and I was left, for the time, on perceiving that she too said\r\nnothing, to study Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s odd face. I did this to such purpose\r\nthat I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a silence\r\nthat, however, I would engage to break down on the first private\r\nopportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes\r\nwith her in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, where, in the twilight, amid a\r\nsmell of lately baked bread, but with the place all swept and\r\ngarnished, I found her sitting in pained placidity before the fire. So\r\nI see her still, so I see her best: facing the flame from her straight\r\nchair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the \xe2\x80\x9cput\r\naway\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them\xe2\x80\x94so long as\r\nthey were there\xe2\x80\x94of course I promised. But what had happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only went with you for the walk,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had then to come back\r\nto meet a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cA friend\xe2\x80\x94_you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I have a couple!\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut did the children give you a\r\nreason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it\r\nbetter. Do you like it better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy face had made her rueful. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I like it worse!\xe2\x80\x9d But after an\r\ninstant I added: \xe2\x80\x9cDid they say why I should like it better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Master Miles only said, \xe2\x80\x98We must do nothing but what she likes!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Flora was too sweet. She said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, of course, of course!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nsaid the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were too sweet, too\xe2\x80\x94I can hear you all. But\r\nnonetheless, between Miles and me, it\xe2\x80\x99s now all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll out?\xe2\x80\x9d My companion stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind. I came home, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a talk with Miss Jessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs. Grose literally well\r\nin hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as she\r\nbravely blinked under the signal of my word, I could keep her\r\ncomparatively firm. \xe2\x80\x9cA talk! Do you mean she spoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to that. I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d I can hear the good woman still, and the candor\r\nof her stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she suffers the torments\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture,\r\ngape. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94of the lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the lost. Of the damned. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, to share them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I faltered\r\nmyself with the horror of it.\r\n\r\nBut my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. \xe2\x80\x9cTo share them\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants Flora.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose might, as I gave it to her, fairly have\r\nfallen away from me had I not been prepared. I still held her there, to\r\nshow I was. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, however, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind? But to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you call \xe2\x80\x98everything\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sending for their uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, miss, in pity do,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cah, but I will, I _will!_\r\nI see it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. What\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98out,\xe2\x80\x99 as I told you, with Miles is\r\nthat if he thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to\xe2\x80\x94and has ideas of what he gains by\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94he shall see he\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here\r\nfrom me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d my companion pressed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s that awful reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she\r\nwas excusable for being vague. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the letter from his old place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll show it to the master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have done so on the instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grose with decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put it before him,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on inexorably, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t undertake\r\nto work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor we\xe2\x80\x99ve never in the least known what!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor wickedness. For what else\xe2\x80\x94when he\xe2\x80\x99s so clever and beautiful and\r\nperfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite\xe2\x80\x94so it can be only _that_; and that would open up the\r\nwhole thing. After all,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s fault. If he left\r\nhere such people\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t really in the least know them. The fault\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nturned quite pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t suffer,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children shan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she emphatically returned.\r\n\r\nI was silent awhile; we looked at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what am I to tell\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him anything. _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI measured this. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll write\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Remembering she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nI caught myself up. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you communicate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell the bailiff. _He_ writes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd should you like him to write our story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy question had a sarcastic force that I had not fully intended, and it\r\nmade her, after a moment, inconsequently break down. The tears were\r\nagain in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, miss, _you_ write!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d I at last answered; and on this we separated.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nI went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had\r\nchanged back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my\r\nroom, with Flora at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a\r\nblank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the\r\nbatter of the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the\r\npassage and listened a minute at Miles\xe2\x80\x99s door. What, under my endless\r\nobsession, I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his\r\nnot being at rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I\r\nhad expected. His voice tinkled out. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, you there\xe2\x80\x94come in.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\na gaiety in the gloom!\r\n\r\nI went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but\r\nvery much at his ease. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are _you_ up to?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with a\r\ngrace of sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs. Grose, had\r\nshe been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stood over him with my candle. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know I was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlike a troop of cavalry!\xe2\x80\x9d he beautifully laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you weren\xe2\x80\x99t asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much! I lie awake and think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held\r\nout his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you think of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world, my dear, but _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t insist on that! I\r\nhad so far rather you slept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI marked the coolness of his firm little hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what queer business,\r\nMiles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper\r\nthere was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by all the rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and\r\nour eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of\r\nadmitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was\r\nperhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\r\nyou shall go back to school,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be that that troubles you.\r\nBut not to the old place\xe2\x80\x94we must find another, a better. How could I\r\nknow it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so,\r\nnever spoke of it at all?\xe2\x80\x9d His clear, listening face, framed in its\r\nsmooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful\r\npatient in a children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital; and I would have given, as the\r\nresemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse\r\nor the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even\r\nas it was, I perhaps might help! \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know you\xe2\x80\x99ve never said a word\r\nto me about your school\xe2\x80\x94I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any\r\nway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly\r\ngained time; he waited, he called for guidance. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor _me_ to help him\xe2\x80\x94it was for the thing I had met!\r\n\r\nSomething in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this\r\nfrom him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet\r\nknown; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled\r\nand his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a\r\npart of innocence and consistency. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, never\xe2\x80\x94from the hour you came\r\nback. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your\r\ncomrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at\r\nschool. Never, little Miles\xe2\x80\x94no, never\xe2\x80\x94have you given me an inkling of\r\nanything that _may_ have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how\r\nmuch I\xe2\x80\x99m in the dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning, you\r\nhad, since the first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference to\r\nanything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret\r\nprecocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I\r\ndared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his\r\ninward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person\xe2\x80\x94imposed him\r\nalmost as an intellectual equal. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you wanted to go on as you\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any\r\nrate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I want to get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tired of Bly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I like Bly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _you_ know what a boy wants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know so well as Miles, and I took temporary\r\nrefuge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to go to your uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the\r\npillow. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t get off with that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was silent a little, and it was I, now, I think, who changed color.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t, even if you do. You can\xe2\x80\x99t, you can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he lay beautifully\r\nstaring. \xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle must come down, and you must completely settle\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we do,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned with some spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may be sure it will be to\r\ntake you quite away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m working for?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tell him\xe2\x80\x94about the way you\xe2\x80\x99ve let it all drop: you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to tell him a tremendous lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the\r\ninstant, to meet him rather more. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much will _you_, Miles, have\r\nto tell him? There are things he\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely. But what things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe things you\xe2\x80\x99ve never told me. To make up his mind what to do with\r\nyou. He can\xe2\x80\x99t send you back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a new field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety;\r\nand doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the\r\npoignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance\r\nat the end of three months with all this bravado and still more\r\ndishonor. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear\r\nthat, and it made me let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the\r\ntenderness of my pity I embraced him. \xe2\x80\x9cDear little Miles, dear little\r\nMiles\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with\r\nindulgent good humor. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all that you want to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his\r\nhand to look at as one had seen sick children look. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ntold you this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, I was sorry for him! \xe2\x80\x9cThat you just want me not to worry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding\r\nhim; then ever so gently, \xe2\x80\x9cTo let me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nThere was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made me\r\nrelease him, yet, when I had slowly risen, linger beside him. God knows\r\nI never wished to harass him, but I felt that merely, at this, to turn\r\nmy back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just begun a letter to your uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, finish it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI waited a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gazed up at me again. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you came back. And before you went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that I\r\ncaught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting\r\nconsciousness\xe2\x80\x94it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once\r\nmore the chance of possessing him. \xe2\x80\x9cDear little Miles, dear little\r\nMiles, if you _knew_ how I want to help you! It\xe2\x80\x99s only that, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing but that, and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather die than give you a pain or do you a\r\nwrong\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear little Miles\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh, I\r\nbrought it out now even if I _should_ go too far\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI just want you to\r\nhelp me to save you!\xe2\x80\x9d But I knew in a moment after this that I had gone\r\ntoo far. The answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the\r\nform of an extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of frozen air, and a\r\nshake of the room as great as if, in the wild wind, the casement had\r\ncrashed in. The boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest\r\nof the shock of sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so\r\nclose to him, a note either of jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my\r\nfeet again and was conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained,\r\nwhile I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred\r\nand the window tight. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the candle\xe2\x80\x99s out!\xe2\x80\x9d I then cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I who blew it, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nThe next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found a moment to say to me\r\nquietly: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you written, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve written.\xe2\x80\x9d But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t add\xe2\x80\x94for the hour\xe2\x80\x94that my letter,\r\nsealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would be time enough\r\nto send it before the messenger should go to the village. Meanwhile\r\nthere had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more\r\nexemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to\r\ngloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest\r\nfeats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of _my_ feeble range, and\r\nperpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical\r\njokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he\r\nappeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child,\r\nto my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no\r\nwords can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every\r\nimpulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the\r\nuninitiated eye all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more\r\nextraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the\r\nwonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me; to\r\ncheck the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which I constantly\r\nboth attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman\r\ncould have done that deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy\r\nI knew, the imagination of all evil _had_ been opened up to him: all\r\nthe justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have\r\nflowered into an act.\r\n\r\nHe had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after\r\nour early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like him, for half an hour, to play to me. David playing to\r\nSaul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was\r\nliterally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite\r\ntantamount to his saying outright: \xe2\x80\x9cThe true knights we love to read\r\nabout never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you\r\nmean that\xe2\x80\x94to be let alone yourself and not followed up\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll cease to\r\nworry and spy upon me, won\xe2\x80\x99t keep me so close to you, will let me go\r\nand come. Well, I \xe2\x80\x98come,\xe2\x80\x99 you see\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t go! There\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty of\r\ntime for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to\r\nshow you that I contended for a principle.\xe2\x80\x9d It may be imagined whether\r\nI resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand,\r\nto the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he had\r\nnever played; and if there are those who think he had better have been\r\nkicking a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them. For at\r\nthe end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to\r\nmeasure, I started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at\r\nmy post. It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much\r\nworse\xe2\x80\x94I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the\r\nquestion to Miles, he played on a minute before answering and then\r\ncould only say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear, how do _I_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94breaking moreover into\r\na happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal\r\naccompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.\r\n\r\nI went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before\r\ngoing downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere\r\nabout she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of that\r\ntheory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I had\r\nfound her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with\r\nblank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast,\r\nI had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her\r\nright, for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out\r\nof my sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed she\r\nmight be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for\r\nher without an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but\r\nwhen, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in\r\nthe hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded\r\ninquiries we had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there,\r\napart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with\r\nwhat high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first\r\ngiven her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be above,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin one of the rooms you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsearched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she\xe2\x80\x99s at a distance.\xe2\x80\x9d I had made up my mind. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI naturally also looked volumes. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that woman always without one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s with _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s with _her!_\xe2\x80\x9d I declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy hand was on my friend\xe2\x80\x99s arm, but she failed for the moment,\r\nconfronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my\r\npressure. She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her\r\nuneasiness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s Master Miles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ with Quint. They\xe2\x80\x99re in the schoolroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, miss!\xe2\x80\x9d My view, I was myself aware\xe2\x80\x94and therefore I suppose my\r\ntone\xe2\x80\x94had never yet reached so calm an assurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trick\xe2\x80\x99s played,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully worked their\r\nplan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she\r\nwent off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Divine\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfernal, then!\xe2\x80\x9d I almost cheerfully rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has provided for\r\nhimself as well. But come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. \xe2\x80\x9cYou leave him\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long with Quint? Yes\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand,\r\nand in this manner she could at present still stay me. But after\r\ngasping an instant at my sudden resignation, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of your letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe eagerly brought out.\r\n\r\nI quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it\r\nup, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great hall table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuke will take it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said as I came back. I reached the house door\r\nand opened it; I was already on the steps.\r\n\r\nMy companion still demurred: the storm of the night and the early\r\nmorning had dropped, but the afternoon was damp and gray. I came down\r\nto the drive while she stood in the doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go with nothing on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care when the child has nothing? I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to dress,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself,\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith _them?_\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, on this, the poor woman promptly joined me!\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nWe went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay\r\nrightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet\r\nof water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes. My\r\nacquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at\r\nall events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection\r\nof my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat\r\nmoored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its\r\nagitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the\r\nhouse, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be,\r\nshe was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small\r\nadventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared\r\nwith her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to\r\nwhich she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteps so marked a direction\xe2\x80\x94a direction that made her, when she\r\nperceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly\r\nmystified. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to the water, Miss?\xe2\x80\x94you think she\xe2\x80\x99s _in_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But\r\nwhat I judge most likely is that she\xe2\x80\x99s on the spot from which, the\r\nother day, we saw together what I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she pretended not to see\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith that astounding self-possession? I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been sure she wanted\r\nto go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou suppose they really\r\n_talk_ of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could meet this with a confidence! They say things that, if we heard\r\nthem, would simply appall us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if she _is_ there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Miss Jessel is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond a doubt. You shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I\r\nwent straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however,\r\nshe was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her\r\napprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as\r\nher least danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in\r\nsight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child.\r\nThere was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my\r\nobservation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite\r\nedge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came\r\ndown to the water. The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant\r\ncompared to its length that, with its ends out of view, it might have\r\nbeen taken for a scant river. We looked at the empty expanse, and then\r\nI felt the suggestion of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. I knew what she meant and I\r\nreplied with a negative headshake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; wait! She has taken the boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across\r\nthe lake. \xe2\x80\x9cThen where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go\r\nover, and then has managed to hide it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll alone\xe2\x80\x94that child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not alone, and at such times she\xe2\x80\x99s not a child: she\xe2\x80\x99s an old,\r\nold woman.\xe2\x80\x9d I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took\r\nagain, into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges of\r\nsubmission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a\r\nsmall refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation\r\nmasked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump\r\nof trees growing close to the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if the boat\xe2\x80\x99s there, where on earth\xe2\x80\x99s _she?_\xe2\x80\x9d my colleague\r\nanxiously asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we must learn.\xe2\x80\x9d And I started to walk further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy going all the way round?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s far\r\nenough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much\r\nfor her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got\r\nhalfway round\xe2\x80\x94a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by\r\na path choked with overgrowth\xe2\x80\x94I paused to give her breath. I sustained\r\nher with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely help me;\r\nand this started us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes\r\nmore we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where I had\r\nsupposed it. It had been intentionally left as much as possible out of\r\nsight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just\r\nthere, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to\r\ndisembarking. I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short, thick\r\noars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a\r\nlittle girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and\r\nhad panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in the\r\nfence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling\r\ninterval, more into the open. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d we both exclaimed\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nFlora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if\r\nher performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was\r\nto stoop straight down and pluck\xe2\x80\x94quite as if it were all she was there\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became sure she had\r\njust come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself taking a\r\nstep, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently\r\napproached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done\r\nin a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose was the first\r\nto break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the\r\nchild to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,\r\nyielding body. While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only watch\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94which I did the more intently when I saw Flora\xe2\x80\x99s face peep at me\r\nover our companion\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. It was serious now\xe2\x80\x94the flicker had left\r\nit; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied\r\nMrs. Grose the simplicity of _her_ relation. Still, all this while,\r\nnothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern\r\nagain drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each\r\nother was that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose finally got\r\nup she kept the child\xe2\x80\x99s hand, so that the two were still before me; and\r\nthe singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the\r\nfrank look she launched me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cif _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_\r\nspeak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.\r\nShe was struck with our bareheaded aspect. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where are your\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere yours are, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d I promptly returned.\r\n\r\nShe had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an\r\nanswer quite sufficient. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s Miles?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:\r\nthese three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn\r\nblade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had\r\nheld high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt\r\noverflow in a deluge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell _me_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I heard\r\nmyself say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I\r\nbrought the thing out handsomely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, my pet, is Miss Jessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nJust as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much\r\nas I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,\r\nbeen sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child\xe2\x80\x99s face now\r\nreceived it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a\r\npane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,\r\nthat Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nshriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within\r\na few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my\r\ncolleague\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s there, she\xe2\x80\x99s there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had\r\nstood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling\r\nnow produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She\r\nwas there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel\r\nnor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there\r\nmost for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so\r\nextraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nsense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and\r\nunderstand it\xe2\x80\x94an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on\r\nthe spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all\r\nthe long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. This\r\nfirst vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds,\r\nduring which Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s dazed blink across to where I pointed struck\r\nme as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my\r\nown eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation then of the manner\r\nin which Flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it\r\nwould have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was\r\nof course not what I had expected. Prepared and on her guard as our\r\npursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and I\r\nwas therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the\r\nparticular one for which I had not allowed. To see her, without a\r\nconvulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the\r\ndirection of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn\r\nat _me_ an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely\r\nnew and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself\r\ninto the very presence that could make me quail. I quailed even though\r\nmy certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that\r\ninstant, and in the immediate need to defend myself I called it\r\npassionately to witness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s there, you little unhappy thing\xe2\x80\x94there,\r\nthere, _there_, and you see her as well as you see me!\xe2\x80\x9d I had said\r\nshortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a child,\r\nbut an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been\r\nmore strikingly confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to\r\nthis, she simply showed me, without a concession, an admission, of her\r\neyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite\r\nfixed, reprobation. I was by this time\xe2\x80\x94if I can put the whole thing at\r\nall together\xe2\x80\x94more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than\r\nat anything else, though it was simultaneously with this that I became\r\naware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with.\r\nMy elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blotted out\r\neverything but her own flushed face and her loud, shocked protest, a\r\nburst of high disapproval. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss!\r\nWhere on earth do you see anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the\r\nhideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already\r\nlasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague,\r\nquite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my\r\npointing hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t see her exactly as _we_ see?\xe2\x80\x94you mean to say\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t now\xe2\x80\x94_now?_ She\xe2\x80\x99s as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest\r\nwoman, _look_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep\r\ngroan of negation, repulsion, compassion\xe2\x80\x94the mixture with her pity of\r\nher relief at her exemption\xe2\x80\x94a sense, touching to me even then, that she\r\nwould have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that,\r\nfor with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly\r\nsealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt\xe2\x80\x94I saw\xe2\x80\x94my livid\r\npredecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was\r\nconscious, more than all, of what I should have from this instant to\r\ndeal with in the astounding little attitude of Flora. Into this\r\nattitude Mrs. Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even\r\nwhile there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private\r\ntriumph, into breathless reassurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t there, little lady, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s there\xe2\x80\x94and you never see\r\nnothing, my sweet! How can poor Miss Jessel\xe2\x80\x94when poor Miss Jessel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead and buried? _We_ know, don\xe2\x80\x99t we, love?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she appealed,\r\nblundering in, to the child. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all a mere mistake and a worry and a\r\njoke\xe2\x80\x94and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home as fast as we can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of\r\npropriety, and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united, as\r\nit were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with her\r\nsmall mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to\r\nforgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to\r\nour friend\xe2\x80\x99s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly\r\nfailed, had quite vanished. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it already\xe2\x80\x94she was literally, she\r\nwas hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never _have_. I\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99re cruel. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, after this deliverance,\r\nwhich might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the\r\nstreet, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the\r\ndreadful little face. In this position she produced an almost furious\r\nwail. \xe2\x80\x9cTake me away, take me away\xe2\x80\x94oh, take me away from _her!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d I panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom you\xe2\x80\x94from you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to do\r\nbut communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank,\r\nwithout a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the\r\ninterval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was\r\nnot there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if\r\nshe had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words,\r\nand I could therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept, but\r\nsadly shake my head at her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had ever doubted, all my doubt would\r\nat present have gone. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been living with the miserable truth, and\r\nnow it has only too much closed round me. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost you: I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ninterfered, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\xe2\x80\x94under _her_ dictation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with which I faced,\r\nover the pool again, our infernal witness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe easy and perfect way to\r\nmeet it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost you. Goodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d For Mrs. Grose\r\nI had an imperative, an almost frantic \xe2\x80\x9cGo, go!\xe2\x80\x9d before which, in\r\ninfinite distress, but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly\r\nconvinced, in spite of her blindness, that something awful had occurred\r\nand some collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come,\r\nas fast as she could move.\r\n\r\nOf what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent\r\nmemory. I only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an\r\nhour, an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and piercing my\r\ntrouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown myself, on my\r\nface, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief. I must have\r\nlain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head the day\r\nwas almost done. I got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at\r\nthe gray pool and its blank, haunted edge, and then I took, back to the\r\nhouse, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached the gate in the\r\nfence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh\r\nreflection to make on Flora\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary command of the situation.\r\nShe passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not\r\nthe word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with\r\nMrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand,\r\nas by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan use no other phrase\xe2\x80\x94so much of him that it was as if it were more\r\nthan it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the\r\nportentous quality of this one; in spite of which\xe2\x80\x94and in spite also of\r\nthe deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94there was literally, in the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily\r\nsweet sadness. On reaching the house I had never so much as looked for\r\nthe boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was\r\nwearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to Flora\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrupture. Her little belongings had all been removed. When later, by the\r\nschoolroom fire, I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged,\r\non the article of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his\r\nfreedom now\xe2\x80\x94he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it; and it\r\nconsisted\xe2\x80\x94in part at least\xe2\x80\x94of his coming in at about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock and\r\nsitting down with me in silence. On the removal of the tea things I had\r\nblown out the candles and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a\r\nmortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. So, when\r\nhe appeared, I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a\r\nmoment by the door as if to look at me; then\xe2\x80\x94as if to share them\xe2\x80\x94came\r\nto the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair. We sat there in\r\nabsolute stillness; yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nBefore a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to Mrs.\r\nGrose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. Flora was so\r\nmarkedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a\r\nnight of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had\r\nfor their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present,\r\ngoverness. It was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss Jessel\r\non the scene that she protested\xe2\x80\x94it was conspicuously and passionately\r\nagainst mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense\r\ndeal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her\r\nloins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the\r\nquestion of her sense of the child\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity as against my own. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\npersists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy visitor\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, truly, was great. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, miss, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter on\r\nwhich I can push her! Yet it isn\xe2\x80\x99t either, I must say, as if I much\r\nneeded to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents, for all the world like\r\nsome high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and, as\r\nit were, her respectability. \xe2\x80\x98Miss Jessel indeed\xe2\x80\x94_she!_\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98respectable,\xe2\x80\x99 the chit! The impression she gave me there yesterday\r\nwas, I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any\r\nof the others. I _did_ put my foot in it! She\xe2\x80\x99ll never speak to me\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHideous and obscure as it all was, it held Mrs. Grose briefly silent;\r\nthen she granted my point with a frankness which, I made sure, had more\r\nbehind it. \xe2\x80\x9cI think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a grand\r\nmanner about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that manner\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I summed it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis practically what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\nher now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, that manner, I could see in my visitor\xe2\x80\x99s face, and not a little\r\nelse besides! \xe2\x80\x9cShe asks me every three minutes if I think you\xe2\x80\x99re coming\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d I, too, on my side, had so much more than worked it out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she said to you since yesterday\xe2\x80\x94except to repudiate her\r\nfamiliarity with anything so dreadful\xe2\x80\x94a single other word about Miss\r\nJessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one, miss. And of course you know,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend added, \xe2\x80\x9cI took it\r\nfrom her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there _was_\r\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict her. What else can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the world! You\xe2\x80\x99ve the cleverest little person to deal with.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve made them\xe2\x80\x94their two friends, I mean\xe2\x80\x94still cleverer even than\r\nnature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! Flora has now her\r\ngrievance, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll work it to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss; but to _what_ end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She\xe2\x80\x99ll make me out to him\r\nthe lowest creature\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI winced at the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose\xe2\x80\x99s face; she looked\r\nfor a minute as if she sharply saw them together. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd him who thinks\r\nso well of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has an odd way\xe2\x80\x94it comes over me now,\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94of proving it!\r\nBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. What Flora wants, of course, is to get rid of\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy companion bravely concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cNever again to so much as look at\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to me now for,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cis to speed me on\r\nmy way?\xe2\x80\x9d Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a better idea\xe2\x80\x94the result of my reflections. My going _would_ seem\r\nthe right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo. It\xe2\x80\x99s _you_ who must go. You must take Flora.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy visitor, at this, did speculate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where in the world\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway from here. Away from _them_. Away, even most of all, now, from\r\nme. Straight to her uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to tell on you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was still vague. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what _is_ your remedy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me hard. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think\r\nit. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as\r\npossible and leave me with him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d I was amazed, myself, at the\r\nspirit I had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more\r\ndisconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it,\r\nshe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on: \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t, before she goes, see each other for three seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d Then it\r\ncame over me that, in spite of Flora\xe2\x80\x99s presumable sequestration from\r\nthe instant of her return from the pool, it might already be too late.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d I anxiously asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they _have_ met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she quite flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, miss, I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a fool as that! If\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has been each\r\ntime with one of the maids, and at present, though she\xe2\x80\x99s alone, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlocked in safe. And yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet!\xe2\x80\x9d There were too many things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you so sure of the little gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of anything but _you_. But I have, since last evening, a\r\nnew hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do believe\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94poor little exquisite wretch!\xe2\x80\x94he wants to speak. Last evening, in\r\nthe firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if it\r\nwere just coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grose looked hard, through the window, at the gray, gathering day.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did it come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it was\r\nwithout a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night.\r\nAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, if her uncle sees her, consent to\r\nhis seeing her brother without my having given the boy\xe2\x80\x94and most of all\r\nbecause things have got so bad\xe2\x80\x94a little more time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than I could quite\r\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by more time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a day or two\xe2\x80\x94really to bring it out. He\xe2\x80\x99ll then be on _my_\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94of which you see the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only\r\nfail, and you will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your\r\narrival in town, whatever you may have found possible.\xe2\x80\x9d So I put it\r\nbefore her, but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed\r\nthat I came again to her aid. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d I wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cyou really\r\nwant _not_ to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see it, in her face, at last clear itself; she put out her hand\r\nto me as a pledge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted to be very just. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you _should_ wish still to wait, I would\r\nengage she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no: it\xe2\x80\x99s the place itself. She must leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d She held me a\r\nmoment with heavy eyes, then brought out the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cYour idea\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nright one. I myself, miss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\r\nthat, since yesterday, you _have_ seen\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve _heard_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that child\xe2\x80\x94horrors! There!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed with tragic relief. \xe2\x80\x9cOn my\r\nhonor, miss, she says things\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d But at this evocation she broke down;\r\nshe dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, as I had seen her do\r\nbefore, gave way to all the grief of it.\r\n\r\nIt was quite in another manner that I, for my part, let myself go. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nthank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang up again at this, drying her eyes with a groan. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt so justifies me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does that, miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have desired more emphasis, but I just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nhorrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it. \xe2\x80\x9cReally shocking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout you, miss\xe2\x80\x94since you must have it. It\xe2\x80\x99s beyond everything, for a\r\nyoung lady; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think wherever she must have picked up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe appalling language she applied to me? I can, then!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke in\r\nwith a laugh that was doubtless significant enough.\r\n\r\nIt only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps I\r\nought to also\xe2\x80\x94since I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some of it before! Yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe poor woman went on while, with the same movement, she glanced, on\r\nmy dressing table, at the face of my watch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kept her, however. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I stop with her, you mean? Why, just _for_ that: to get her\r\naway. Far from this,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cfar from _them_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may be different? She may be free?\xe2\x80\x9d I seized her almost with joy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in spite of yesterday, you _believe_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn such doings?\xe2\x80\x9d Her simple description of them required, in the light\r\nof her expression, to be carried no further, and she gave me the whole\r\nthing as she had never done. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if I might\r\ncontinue sure of that I should care but little what else happened. My\r\nsupport in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in\r\nmy early need of confidence, and if my friend would answer for my\r\nhonesty, I would answer for all the rest. On the point of taking leave\r\nof her, nonetheless, I was to some extent embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing, of course\xe2\x80\x94it occurs to me\xe2\x80\x94to remember. My letter, giving the\r\nalarm, will have reached town before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and\r\nhow weary at last it had made her. \xe2\x80\x9cYour letter won\xe2\x80\x99t have got there.\r\nYour letter never went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then became of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows! Master Miles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean _he_ took it?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\nShe hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I saw\r\nyesterday, when I came back with Miss Flora, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t where you\r\nhad put it. Later in the evening I had the chance to question Luke, and\r\nhe declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.\xe2\x80\x9d We could only\r\nexchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual soundings, and it was Mrs.\r\nGrose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated \xe2\x80\x9cYou see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see that if Miles took it instead he probably will have read it\r\nand destroyed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you see anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI faced her a moment with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me that by this time\r\nyour eyes are open even wider than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cI make out now what he must have done at school.\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave, in\r\nher simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. \xe2\x80\x9cHe stole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned it over\xe2\x80\x94I tried to be more judicial. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked as if she found me unexpectedly calm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe stole _letters!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow;\r\nso I showed them off as I might. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope then it was to more purpose\r\nthan in this case! The note, at any rate, that I put on the table\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwill have given him so scant an advantage\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nit contained only the bare demand for an interview\xe2\x80\x94that he is already\r\nmuch ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that what he had\r\non his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nseemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to see it all.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave us, leave us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I was already, at the door, hurrying her off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it out of him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll meet me\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll confess. If he confesses,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s saved. And if he\xe2\x80\x99s saved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _you_ are?\xe2\x80\x9d The dear woman kissed me on this, and I took her\r\nfarewell. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll save you without him!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried as she went.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nYet it was when she had got off\xe2\x80\x94and I missed her on the spot\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\ngreat pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give me to\r\nfind myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least, that it\r\nwould give me a measure. No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed\r\nwith apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage\r\ncontaining Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of\r\nthe gates. Now I _was_, I said to myself, face to face with the\r\nelements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my\r\nweakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a\r\ntighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that,\r\nfor the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused\r\nreflection of the crisis. What had happened naturally caused them all\r\nto stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we\r\nmight, in the suddenness of my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s act. The maids and the men\r\nlooked blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until\r\nI saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely, in\r\nshort, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and I\r\ndare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand\r\nand very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much\r\nto do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I\r\nwas quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next\r\nhour or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I\r\nwere ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,\r\nI paraded with a sick heart.\r\n\r\nThe person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner,\r\nlittle Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no\r\nglimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change\r\ntaking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the\r\npiano, the day before, kept me, in Flora\xe2\x80\x99s interest, so beguiled and\r\nbefooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her\r\nconfinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by\r\nour nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had\r\nalready disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I\r\nlearned below that he had breakfasted\xe2\x80\x94in the presence of a couple of\r\nthe maids\xe2\x80\x94with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he\r\nsaid, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have\r\nexpressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office.\r\nWhat he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be\r\nsettled: there was a queer relief, at all events\xe2\x80\x94I mean for myself in\r\nespecial\xe2\x80\x94in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung\r\nto the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had\r\nperhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction\r\nthat I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that,\r\nby tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out\r\nthe care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off\r\nstraining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any\r\nrate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply\r\nshown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous\r\nnight, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded,\r\nneither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other\r\nideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them,\r\nthe accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by\r\nthe beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet,\r\nfor the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.\r\n\r\nTo mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my\r\nmeals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so\r\nthat I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside\r\nof the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared\r\nSunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light.\r\nHere at present I felt afresh\xe2\x80\x94for I had felt it again and again\xe2\x80\x94how my\r\nequilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut\r\nmy eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what I had to deal with\r\nwas, revoltingly, against nature. I could only get on at all by taking\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous\r\nordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but\r\ndemanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw\r\nof ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require\r\nmore tact than just this attempt to supply, one\xe2\x80\x99s self, _all_ the\r\nnature. How could I put even a little of that article into a\r\nsuppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand,\r\ncould I make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure?\r\nWell, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far\r\nconfirmed as that I was met, incontestably, by the quickened vision of\r\nwhat was rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found\r\neven now\xe2\x80\x94as he had so often found at lessons\xe2\x80\x94still some other delicate\r\nway to ease me off. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there light in the fact which, as we shared\r\nour solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite\r\nworn?\xe2\x80\x94the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had\r\nnow come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego\r\nthe help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his\r\nintelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn\xe2\x80\x99t one, to reach\r\nhis mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was\r\nas if, when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally\r\nshown me the way. The roast mutton was on the table, and I had\r\ndispensed with attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment\r\nwith his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he\r\nseemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he\r\npresently produced was: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, my dear, is she really very awfully\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Flora? Not so bad but that she\xe2\x80\x99ll presently be better. London\r\nwill set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take\r\nyour mutton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and,\r\nwhen he was established, went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDid Bly disagree with her so\r\nterribly suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so suddenly as you might think. One had seen it coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get her off before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore she became too ill to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found myself prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s _not_ too ill to travel: she only might\r\nhave become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize.\r\nThe journey will dissipate the influence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh, I was grand!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand carry\r\nit off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to\r\nhis repast with the charming little \xe2\x80\x9ctable manner\xe2\x80\x9d that, from the day\r\nof his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition.\r\nWhatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly\r\nfeeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was\r\nunmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for\r\ngranted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and\r\nhe dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. Our meal\r\nwas of the briefest\xe2\x80\x94mine a vain pretense, and I had the things\r\nimmediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his\r\nhands in his little pockets and his back to me\xe2\x80\x94stood and looked out of\r\nthe wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled\r\nme up. We continued silent while the maid was with us\xe2\x80\x94as silent, it\r\nwhimsically occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding\r\njourney, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. He turned\r\nround only when the waiter had left us. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94so we\xe2\x80\x99re alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, more or less.\xe2\x80\x9d I fancy my smile was pale. \xe2\x80\x9cNot absolutely. We\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that!\xe2\x80\x9d I went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I suppose we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Of course we have the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the others\xe2\x80\x94we have indeed the others,\xe2\x80\x9d I concurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet even though we have them,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, still with his hands in\r\nhis pockets and planted there in front of me, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t much count,\r\ndo they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made the best of it, but I felt wan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on what you call\r\n\xe2\x80\x98much\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with all accommodation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceverything depends!\xe2\x80\x9d On this, however, he\r\nfaced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague,\r\nrestless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with his forehead\r\nagainst the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I knew and the\r\ndull things of November. I had always my hypocrisy of \xe2\x80\x9cwork,\xe2\x80\x9d behind\r\nwhich, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with it there as I had\r\nrepeatedly done at those moments of torment that I have described as\r\nthe moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from\r\nwhich I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared\r\nfor the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I\r\nextracted a meaning from the boy\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed back\xe2\x80\x94none other than the\r\nimpression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a few\r\nminutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct\r\nperception that it was positively _he_ who was. The frames and squares\r\nof the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of\r\nfailure. I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He\r\nwas admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope.\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x94and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it the first time in the whole business that he had\r\nknown such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it a splendid\r\nportent. It made him anxious, though he watched himself; he had been\r\nanxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat\r\nat table, had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss.\r\nWhen he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this\r\ngenius had succumbed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m glad Bly agrees with _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good\r\ndeal more of it than for some time before. I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on bravely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve been enjoying yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ever so far; all round about\xe2\x80\x94miles and miles away.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been so free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\n_you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94more discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain.\r\nBefore I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with\r\nthe sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing could\r\nbe more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we\xe2\x80\x99re alone\r\ntogether now it\xe2\x80\x99s you that are alone most. But I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he threw in,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving to do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, how can I help\r\nminding? Though I\xe2\x80\x99ve renounced all claim to your company\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nbeyond me\xe2\x80\x94I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me more directly, and the expression of his face, graver\r\nnow, struck me as the most beautiful I had ever found in it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay\r\non just for _that?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest I\r\ntake in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth\r\nyour while. That needn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you.\xe2\x80\x9d My voice trembled so that I\r\nfelt it impossible to suppress the shake. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how I\r\ntold you, when I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that\r\nthere was nothing in the world I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d He, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone\r\nto master; but he was so much more successful than I that, laughing out\r\nthrough his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nthat, I think, was to get me to do something for _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was partly to get you to do something,\xe2\x80\x9d I conceded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you know,\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwanted me to tell you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, is _that_ what you\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed over for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest\r\nlittle quiver of resentful passion; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to express the\r\neffect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint. It was as\r\nif what I had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nyes\xe2\x80\x94I may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited so long that I supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the\r\nassumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally\r\nsaid was: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean now\xe2\x80\x94here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a better place or time.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round him\r\nuneasily, and I had the rare\xe2\x80\x94oh, the queer!\xe2\x80\x94impression of the very\r\nfirst symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It\r\nwas as if he were suddenly afraid of me\xe2\x80\x94which struck me indeed as\r\nperhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort\r\nI felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so\r\ngentle as to be almost grotesque. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want so to go out again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully!\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled at me heroically, and the touching little bravery\r\nof it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain. He had picked up\r\nhis hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling it in a way that\r\ngave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of\r\nwhat I was doing. To do it in _any_ way was an act of violence, for\r\nwhat did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and\r\nguilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of\r\nthe possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it base to create\r\nfor a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read\r\ninto our situation a clearness it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had at the time, for I\r\nseem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a\r\nprevision of the anguish that was to come. So we circled about, with\r\nterrors and scruples, like fighters not daring to close. But it was for\r\neach other we feared! That kept us a little longer suspended and\r\nunbruised. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Miles said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI mean I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nanything you like. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all\r\nright, and I _will_ tell you\xe2\x80\x94I _will_. But not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window\r\nin a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop.\r\nThen he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside,\r\nsomeone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to see\r\nLuke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt\r\nproportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my\r\ntruth. I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\r\ngo to Luke, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for\r\nthat, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a\r\nlittle to bargain. \xe2\x80\x9cVery much smaller\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a mere fraction of the whole. Tell me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh, my work preoccupied\r\nme, and I was offhand!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif, yesterday afternoon, from the table in the\r\nhall, you took, you know, my letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nMy sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something\r\nthat I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention\xe2\x80\x94a stroke\r\nthat at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind\r\nmovement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just\r\nfell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively\r\nkeeping him with his back to the window. The appearance was full upon\r\nus that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into\r\nview like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that,\r\nfrom outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to\r\nthe glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room\r\nhis white face of damnation. It represents but grossly what took place\r\nwithin me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made;\r\nyet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time\r\nrecovered her grasp of the _act_. It came to me in the very horror of\r\nthe immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what I\r\nsaw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration\xe2\x80\x94I can\r\ncall it by no other name\xe2\x80\x94was that I felt how voluntarily, how\r\ntranscendently, I _might_. It was like fighting with a demon for a\r\nhuman soul, and when I had fairly so appraised it I saw how the human\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x94held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length\xe2\x80\x94had a perfect\r\ndew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to\r\nmine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it\r\npresently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further\r\naway, that I drank like a waft of fragrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I took it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I\r\nheld him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his\r\nlittle body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I kept my eyes on\r\nthe thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture. I have\r\nlikened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather\r\nthe prowl of a baffled beast. My present quickened courage, however,\r\nwas such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade, as it\r\nwere, my flame. Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the\r\nwindow, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was the very\r\nconfidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive\r\ncertitude, by this time, of the child\xe2\x80\x99s unconsciousness, that made me\r\ngo on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you take it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see what you said about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou opened the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI opened it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eyes were now, as I held him off a little again, on Miles\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nface, in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the\r\nravage of uneasiness. What was prodigious was that at last, by my\r\nsuccess, his sense was sealed and his communication stopped: he knew\r\nthat he was in presence, but knew not of what, and knew still less that\r\nI also was and that I did know. And what did this strain of trouble\r\nmatter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air\r\nwas clear again and\xe2\x80\x94by my personal triumph\xe2\x80\x94the influence quenched?\r\nThere was nothing there. I felt that the cause was mine and that I\r\nshould surely get _all_. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you found nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I let my elation out.\r\n\r\nHe gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d I almost shouted in my joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he sadly repeated.\r\n\r\nI kissed his forehead; it was drenched. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what have you done with\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve burned it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurned it?\xe2\x80\x9d It was now or never. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you did at school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, what this brought up! \xe2\x80\x9cAt school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you take letters?\xe2\x80\x94or other things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther things?\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared now to be thinking of something far off and\r\nthat reached him only through the pressure of his anxiety. Yet it did\r\nreach him. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I _steal?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it\r\nwere more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him\r\ntake it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the\r\nworld. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it for that you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t go back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\nknow I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t go back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me at this the longest and strangest look. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything. Therefore _did_ you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it again.\r\n\r\nMiles could, very simply. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t steal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands\xe2\x80\x94but it\r\nwas for pure tenderness\xe2\x80\x94shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all\r\nfor nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then did\r\nyou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his\r\nbreath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have\r\nbeen standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some\r\nfaint green twilight. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I said things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey thought it was enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo turn you out for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever, truly, had a person \xe2\x80\x9cturned out\xe2\x80\x9d shown so little to explain it\r\nas this little person! He appeared to weigh my question, but in a\r\nmanner quite detached and almost helpless. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to whom did you say them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe evidently tried to remember, but it dropped\xe2\x80\x94he had lost it. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender, which was\r\nindeed practically, by this time, so complete that I ought to have left\r\nit there. But I was infatuated\xe2\x80\x94I was blind with victory, though even\r\nthen the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was\r\nalready that of added separation. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it to everyone?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it was only to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But he gave a sick little headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember their names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they then so many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94only a few. Those I liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose he liked? I seemed to float not into clearness, but into a darker\r\nobscure, and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity\r\nthe appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the\r\ninstant confounding and bottomless, for if he _were_ innocent, what\r\nthen on earth was _I?_ Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of\r\nthe question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh,\r\nhe turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear\r\nwindow, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him\r\nfrom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd did they repeat what you said?\xe2\x80\x9d I went on after a moment.\r\n\r\nHe was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again\r\nwith the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined\r\nagainst his will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked up at the\r\ndim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but\r\nan unspeakable anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he nevertheless replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey must\r\nhave repeated them. To those _they_ liked,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nThere was, somehow, less of it than I had expected; but I turned it\r\nover. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd these things came round\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the masters? Oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered very simply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe masters? They didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve never told. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to me again his little beautiful fevered face. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was\r\ntoo bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I suppose I sometimes said. To write home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a\r\nspeech by such a speaker; I only know that the next instant I heard\r\nmyself throw off with homely force: \xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d But the next\r\nafter that I must have sounded stern enough. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _were_ these\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sternness was all for his judge, his executioner; yet it made him\r\navert himself again, and that movement made _me_, with a single bound\r\nand an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon him. For there again,\r\nagainst the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his answer,\r\nwas the hideous author of our woe\xe2\x80\x94the white face of damnation. I felt a\r\nsick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle, so\r\nthat the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal.\r\nI saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on\r\nthe perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was\r\nstill to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the\r\nclimax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more,\r\nno more, no more!\xe2\x80\x9d I shrieked, as I tried to press him against me, to\r\nmy visitant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she _here?_\xe2\x80\x9d Miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the\r\ndirection of my words. Then as his strange \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x9d staggered me and, with\r\na gasp, I echoed it, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jessel, Miss Jessel!\xe2\x80\x9d he with a sudden fury\r\ngave me back.\r\n\r\nI seized, stupefied, his supposition\xe2\x80\x94some sequel to what we had done to\r\nFlora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still\r\nthan that. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Miss Jessel! But it\xe2\x80\x99s at the window\xe2\x80\x94straight\r\nbefore us. It\xe2\x80\x99s _there_\xe2\x80\x94the coward horror, there for the last time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a\r\nbaffled dog\xe2\x80\x99s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air\r\nand light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly\r\nover the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled\r\nthe room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _he?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so determined to have all my proof that I flashed into ice to\r\nchallenge him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Quint\xe2\x80\x94you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d His face gave again, round the room, its\r\nconvulsed supplication. \xe2\x80\x9c_Where?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his\r\ntribute to my devotion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he matter now, my own?\xe2\x80\x94what will he\r\n_ever_ matter? _I_ have you,\xe2\x80\x9d I launched at the beast, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has lost\r\nyou forever!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, for the demonstration of my work, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, _there!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said to Miles.\r\n\r\nBut he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and\r\nseen but the quiet day. With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of\r\nhe uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp\r\nwith which I recovered him might have been that of catching him in his\r\nfall. I caught him, yes, I held him\xe2\x80\x94it may be imagined with what a\r\npassion; but at the end of a minute I began to feel what it truly was\r\nthat I held. We were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart,\r\ndispossessed, had stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TURN OF THE SCREW ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.

Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
