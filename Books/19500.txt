Chapter LXXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor and His Daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or no, she, whom you are to forgive, if you can, did or did\r\nnot belong to the Upper Ten Thousand of this our English world, I am\r\nnot prepared to say with any strength of affirmation. By blood she\r\nwas connected with big people,--distantly connected with some very\r\nbig people indeed, people who belonged to the Upper Ten Hundred if\r\nthere be any such division; but of these very big relations she had\r\nknown and seen little, and they had cared as little for her. Her\r\ngrandfather, Squire Vavasor of Vavasor Hall, in Westmoreland, was a\r\ncountry gentleman, possessing some thousand a year at the outside,\r\nand he therefore never came up to London, and had no ambition to have\r\nhimself numbered as one in any exclusive set. A hot-headed, ignorant,\r\nhonest old gentleman, he lived ever at Vavasor Hall, declaring to any\r\nwho would listen to him, that the country was going to the mischief,\r\nand congratulating himself that at any rate, in his county,\r\nparliamentary reform had been powerless to alter the old political\r\narrangements. Alice Vavasor, whose offence against the world I am to\r\ntell you, and if possible to excuse, was the daughter of his younger\r\nson; and as her father, John Vavasor, had done nothing to raise\r\nthe family name to eminence, Alice could not lay claim to any high\r\nposition from her birth as a Vavasor. John Vavasor had come up to\r\nLondon early in life as a barrister, and had failed. He had failed at\r\nleast in attaining either much wealth or much repute, though he had\r\nsucceeded in earning, or perhaps I might better say, in obtaining,\r\na livelihood. He had married a lady somewhat older than himself,\r\nwho was in possession of four hundred a year, and who was related\r\nto those big people to whom I have alluded. Who these were and the\r\nspecial nature of the relationship, I shall be called upon to explain\r\nhereafter, but at present it will suffice to say that Alice Macleod\r\ngave great offence to all her friends by her marriage. She did not,\r\nhowever, give them much time for the indulgence of their anger.\r\nHaving given birth to a daughter within twelve months of her\r\nmarriage, she died, leaving in abeyance that question as to whether\r\nthe fault of her marriage should or should not be pardoned by her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWhen a man marries an heiress for her money, if that money be within\r\nher own control, as was the case with Miss Macleod\'s fortune, it is\r\ngenerally well for the speculating lover that the lady\'s friends\r\nshould quarrel with him and with her. She is thereby driven to throw\r\nherself entirely into the gentleman\'s arms, and he thus becomes\r\npossessed of the wife and the money without the abominable nuisance\r\nof stringent settlements. But the Macleods, though they quarrelled\r\nwith Alice, did not quarrel with her _a l\'outrance_. They snubbed\r\nherself and her chosen husband; but they did not so far separate\r\nthemselves from her and her affairs as to give up the charge of her\r\npossessions. Her four hundred a year was settled very closely on\r\nherself and on her children, without even a life interest having\r\nbeen given to Mr. Vavasor, and therefore when she died the mother\'s\r\nfortune became the property of the little baby. But, under these\r\ncircumstances, the big people did not refuse to interest themselves\r\nto some extent on behalf of the father. I do not suppose that any\r\nactual agreement or compact was made between Mr. Vavasor and the\r\nMacleods; but it came to be understood between them that if he made\r\nno demand upon them for his daughter\'s money, and allowed them to\r\nhave charge of her education, they would do something for him. He was\r\na practising barrister, though his practice had never amounted to\r\nmuch; and a practising barrister is always supposed to be capable of\r\nfilling any situation which may come his way. Two years after his\r\nwife\'s death Mr. Vavasor was appointed assistant commissioner in some\r\noffice which had to do with insolvents, and which was abolished three\r\nyears after his appointment. It was at first thought that he would\r\nkeep his eight hundred a year for life and be required to do nothing\r\nfor it; but a wretched cheeseparing Whig government, as John Vavasor\r\ncalled it when describing the circumstances of the arrangement to his\r\nfather, down in Westmoreland, would not permit this; it gave him the\r\noption of taking four hundred a year for doing nothing, or of keeping\r\nhis whole income and attending three days a week for three hours\r\na day during term time, at a miserable dingy little office near\r\nChancery Lane, where his duty would consist in signing his name to\r\naccounts which he never read, and at which he was never supposed even\r\nto look. He had sulkily elected to keep the money, and this signing\r\nhad been now for nearly twenty years the business of his life. Of\r\ncourse he considered himself to be a very hardly-used man. One Lord\r\nChancellor after another he petitioned, begging that he might be\r\nrelieved from the cruelty of his position, and allowed to take his\r\nsalary without doing anything in return for it. The amount of work\r\nwhich he did perform was certainly a minimum of labour. Term time, as\r\nterms were counted in Mr. Vavasor\'s office, hardly comprised half the\r\nyear, and the hours of weekly attendance did not do more than make\r\none day\'s work a week for a working man; but Mr. Vavasor had been\r\nappointed an assistant commissioner, and with every Lord Chancellor\r\nhe argued that all Westminster Hall, and Lincoln\'s Inn to boot, had\r\nno right to call upon him to degrade himself by signing his name to\r\naccounts. In answer to every memorial he was offered the alternative\r\nof freedom with half his income; and so the thing went on.\r\n\r\nThere can, however, be no doubt that Mr. Vavasor was better off and\r\nhappier with his almost nominal employment than he would have been\r\nwithout it. He always argued that it kept him in London; but he\r\nwould undoubtedly have lived in London with or without his official\r\noccupation. He had become so habituated to London life in a small\r\nway, before the choice of leaving London was open to him, that\r\nnothing would have kept him long away from it. After his wife\'s death\r\nhe dined at his club every day on which a dinner was not given to him\r\nby some friend elsewhere, and was rarely happy except when so dining.\r\nThey who have seen him scanning the steward\'s list of dishes, and\r\ngiving the necessary orders for his own and his friend\'s dinner, at\r\nabout half past four in the afternoon, have seen John Vavasor at\r\nthe only moment of the day at which he is ever much in earnest. All\r\nother things are light and easy to him,--to be taken easily and to be\r\ndismissed easily. Even the eating of the dinner calls forth from him\r\nno special sign of energy. Sometimes a frown will gather on his brow\r\nas he tastes the first half glass from his bottle of claret; but as\r\na rule that which he has prepared for himself with so much elaborate\r\ncare, is consumed with only pleasant enjoyment. Now and again it will\r\nhappen that the cook is treacherous even to him, and then he can hit\r\nhard; but in hitting he is quiet, and strikes with a smile on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSuch had been Mr. Vavasor\'s pursuits and pleasures in life up to the\r\ntime at which my story commences. But I must not allow the reader to\r\nsuppose that he was a man without good qualities. Had he when young\r\npossessed the gift of industry I think that he might have shone in\r\nhis profession, and have been well spoken of and esteemed in the\r\nworld. As it was he was a discontented man, but nevertheless he was\r\npopular, and to some extent esteemed. He was liberal as far as his\r\nmeans would permit; he was a man of his word; and he understood well\r\nthat code of by-laws which was presumed to constitute the character\r\nof a gentleman in his circle. He knew how to carry himself well among\r\nmen, and understood thoroughly what might be said, and what might\r\nnot; what might be done among those with whom he lived, and what\r\nshould be left undone. By nature, too, he was kindly disposed, loving\r\nmany persons a little if he loved few or none passionately. Moreover,\r\nat the age of fifty, he was a handsome man, with a fine forehead,\r\nround which the hair and beard was only beginning to show itself to\r\nbe grey. He stood well, with a large person, only now beginning to\r\nbecome corpulent. His eyes were bright and grey, and his mouth and\r\nchin were sharply cut, and told of gentle birth. Most men who knew\r\nJohn Vavasor well, declared it to be a pity that he should spend his\r\ntime in signing accounts in Chancery Lane.\r\n\r\nI have said that Alice Vavasor\'s big relatives cared but little for\r\nher in her early years; but I have also said that they were careful\r\nto undertake the charge of her education, and I must explain away\r\nthis little discrepancy. The biggest of these big people had hardly\r\nheard of her; but there was a certain Lady Macleod, not very big\r\nherself, but, as it were, hanging on to the skirts of those who\r\nwere so, who cared very much for Alice. She was the widow of a Sir\r\nArchibald Macleod, K.C.B., who had been a soldier, she herself having\r\nalso been a Macleod by birth; and for very many years past--from\r\na time previous to the birth of Alice Vavasor--she had lived at\r\nCheltenham, making short sojourns in London during the spring, when\r\nthe contents of her limited purse would admit of her doing so. Of\r\nold Lady Macleod I think I may say that she was a good woman;--that\r\nshe was a good woman, though subject to two of the most serious\r\ndrawbacks to goodness which can afflict a lady. She was a Calvinistic\r\nSabbatarian in religion, and in worldly matters she was a devout\r\nbeliever in the high rank of her noble relatives. She could almost\r\nworship a youthful marquis, though he lived a life that would\r\ndisgrace a heathen among heathens; and she could and did, in her own\r\nmind, condemn crowds of commonplace men and women to all eternal\r\ntorments of which her imagination could conceive, because they\r\nlistened to profane music in a park on Sunday. Yet she was a good\r\nwoman. Out of her small means she gave much away. She owed no man\r\nanything. She strove to love her neighbours. She bore much pain with\r\ncalm unspeaking endurance, and she lived in trust of a better world.\r\nAlice Vavasor, who was after all only her cousin, she loved with an\r\nexceeding love, and yet Alice had done very much to extinguish such\r\nlove. Alice, in the years of her childhood, had been brought up by\r\nLady Macleod; at the age of twelve she had been sent to a school at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle,--a comitatus of her relatives having agreed that\r\nsuch was to be her fate, much in opposition to Lady Macleod\'s\r\njudgement; at nineteen she had returned to Cheltenham, and after\r\nremaining there for little more than a year, had expressed her\r\nunwillingness to remain longer with her cousin. She could sympathize\r\nneither with her relative\'s faults or virtues. She made an\r\narrangement, therefore, with her father, that they two would keep\r\nhouse together in London, and so they had lived for the last five\r\nyears;--for Alice Vavasor when she will be introduced to the reader\r\nhad already passed her twenty-fourth birthday.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of life had been singular and certainly not in all\r\nrespects satisfactory. Alice when she was twenty-one had the full\r\ncommand of her own fortune; and when she induced her father, who for\r\nthe last fifteen years had lived in lodgings, to take a small house\r\nin Queen Anne Street, of course she offered to incur a portion of\r\nthe expense. He had warned her that his habits were not those of a\r\ndomestic man, but he had been content simply so to warn her. He had\r\nnot felt it to be his duty to decline the arrangement because he knew\r\nhimself to be unable to give to his child all that attention which\r\na widowed father under such circumstances should pay to an only\r\ndaughter. The house had been taken, and Alice and he had lived\r\ntogether, but their lives had been quite apart. For a short time, for\r\na month or two, he had striven to dine at home and even to remain at\r\nhome through the evening; but the work had been too hard for him and\r\nhe had utterly broken down. He had said to her and to himself that\r\nhis health would fail him under the effects of so great a change made\r\nso late in life, and I am not sure that he had not spoken truly. At\r\nany rate the effort had been abandoned, and Mr. Vavasor now never\r\ndined at home. Nor did he and his daughter ever dine out together.\r\nTheir joint means did not admit of their giving dinners, and\r\ntherefore they could not make their joint way in the same circle. It\r\nthus came to pass that they lived apart,--quite apart. They saw each\r\nother, probably daily; but they did little more than see each other.\r\nThey did not even breakfast together, and after three o\'clock in the\r\nday Mr. Vavasor was never to be found in his own house.\r\n\r\nMiss Vavasor had made for herself a certain footing in society,\r\nthough I am disposed to doubt her right to be considered as holding\r\na place among the Upper Ten Thousand. Two classes of people she had\r\nchosen to avoid, having been driven to such avoidings by her aunt\'s\r\npreferences; marquises and such-like, whether wicked or otherwise,\r\nshe had eschewed, and had eschewed likewise all Low Church\r\ntendencies. The eschewing of marquises is not generally very\r\ndifficult. Young ladies living with their fathers on very moderate\r\nincomes in or about Queen Anne Street are not usually much troubled\r\non that matter. Nor can I say that Miss Vavasor was so troubled. But\r\nwith her there was a certain definite thing to be done towards such\r\neschewal. Lady Macleod by no means avoided her noble relatives,\r\nnor did she at all avoid Alice Vavasor. When in London she was\r\npersevering in her visits to Queen Anne Street, though she considered\r\nherself, nobody knew why, not to be on speaking terms with Mr.\r\nVavasor. And she strove hard to produce an intimacy between Alice\r\nand her noble relatives--such an intimacy as that which she herself\r\nenjoyed;--an intimacy which gave her a footing in their houses but no\r\nfooting in their hearts, or even in their habits. But all this Alice\r\ndeclined with as much consistency as she did those other struggles\r\nwhich her old cousin made on her behalf,--strong, never-flagging,\r\nbut ever-failing efforts to induce the girl to go to such places of\r\nworship as Lady Macleod herself frequented.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said as to Alice Vavasor\'s person; one fact\r\nalso must be told, and then, I believe, I may start upon my story.\r\nAs regards her character, I will leave it to be read in the story\r\nitself. The reader already knows that she appears upon the scene at\r\nno very early age, and the mode of her life had perhaps given to her\r\nan appearance of more years than those which she really possessed. It\r\nwas not that her face was old, but that there was nothing that was\r\ngirlish in her manners. Her demeanour was as staid, and her voice\r\nas self-possessed as though she had already been ten years married.\r\nIn person she was tall and well made, rather large in her neck and\r\nshoulders, as were all the Vavasors, but by no means fat. Her hair\r\nwas brown, but very dark, and she wore it rather lower upon her\r\nforehead than is customary at the present day. Her eyes, too, were\r\ndark, though they were not black, and her complexion, though not\r\nquite that of a brunette, was far away from being fair. Her nose was\r\nsomewhat broad, and _retrousse_ too, but to my thinking it was a\r\ncharming nose, full of character, and giving to her face at times a\r\nlook of pleasant humour, which it would otherwise have lacked. Her\r\nmouth was large, and full of character, and her chin oval, dimpled,\r\nand finely chiselled, like her father\'s. I beg you, in taking her for\r\nall in all, to admit that she was a fine, handsome, high-spirited\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\nAnd now for my fact. At the time of which I am writing she was\r\nalready engaged to be married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLady Macleod.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot say that the house in Queen Anne Street was a pleasant\r\nhouse. I am now speaking of the material house, made up of the walls\r\nand furniture, and not of any pleasantness or unpleasantness supplied\r\nby the inmates. It was a small house on the south side of the street,\r\nsqueezed in between two large mansions which seemed to crush it,\r\nand by which its fair proportion of doorstep and area was in truth\r\ncurtailed. The stairs were narrow; the dining-room was dark, and\r\npossessed none of those appearances of plenteous hospitality which a\r\ndining-room should have. But all this would have been as nothing if\r\nthe drawing-room had been pretty as it is the bounden duty of all\r\ndrawing-rooms to be. But Alice Vavasor\'s drawing-room was not pretty.\r\nHer father had had the care of furnishing the house, and he had\r\nintrusted the duty to a tradesman who had chosen green paper, a green\r\ncarpet, green curtains, and green damask chairs. There was a green\r\ndamask sofa, and two green arm-chairs opposite to each other at the\r\ntwo sides of the fireplace. The room was altogether green, and was\r\nnot enticing. In shape it was nearly square, the very small back room\r\non the same floor not having been, as is usual, added to it. This had\r\nbeen fitted up as a "study" for Mr. Vavasor, and was very rarely used\r\nfor any purpose.\r\n\r\nMost of us know when we enter a drawing-room whether it is a pretty\r\nroom or no; but how few of us know how to make a drawing-room pretty!\r\nThere has come up in London in these latter days a form of room so\r\nmonstrously ugly that I will venture to say that no other people on\r\nearth but Londoners would put up with it. Londoners, as a rule, take\r\ntheir houses as they can get them, looking only to situation, size,\r\nand price. What Grecian, what Roman, what Turk, what Italian would\r\nendure, or would ever have endured, to use a room with a monstrous\r\ncantle in the form of a parallelogram cut sheerly out of one corner\r\nof it? This is the shape of room we have now adopted,--or rather\r\nwhich the builders have adopted for us,--in order to throw the whole\r\nfirst floor into one apartment which may be presumed to have noble\r\ndimensions,--with such drawback from it as the necessities of the\r\nstaircase may require. A sharp unadorned corner projects itself into\r\nthese would-be noble dimensions, and as ugly a form of chamber is\r\nproduced as any upon which the eye can look. I would say more on\r\nthe subject if I dared to do so here, but I am bound now to confine\r\nmyself to Miss Vavasor\'s room. The monstrous deformity of which I\r\nhave spoken was not known when that house in Queen Anne Street was\r\nbuilt. There is to be found no such abomination of shape in the\r\nbuildings of our ancestors,--not even in the days of George the\r\nSecond. But yet the drawing-room of which I speak was ugly, and Alice\r\nknew that it was so. She knew that it was ugly, and she would greatly\r\nhave liked to banish the green sofa, to have re-papered the wall, and\r\nto have hung up curtains with a dash of pink through them. With the\r\ngreen carpet she would have been contented. But her father was an\r\nextravagant man; and from the day on which she had come of age she\r\nhad determined that it was her special duty to avoid extravagance.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the ugliest room I ever saw in my life," her father once said\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n"It is not very pretty," Alice replied.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go halves with you in the expense of redoing it," said Mr.\r\nVavasor.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t that be extravagant, papa? The things have not been here\r\nquite four years yet."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Vavasor had shrugged his shoulders and said nothing more\r\nabout it. It was little to him whether the drawing-room in Queen\r\nAnne Street was ugly or pretty. He was on the committee of his club,\r\nand he took care that the furniture there should be in all respects\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nIt was now June; and that month Lady Macleod was in the habit of\r\nspending among her noble relatives in London when she had succeeded\r\nin making both ends so far overlap each other at Cheltenham as to\r\ngive her the fifty pounds necessary for this purpose. For though she\r\nspent her month in London among her noble friends, it must not be\r\nsupposed that her noble friends gave her bed or board. They sometimes\r\ngave her tea, such as it was, and once or twice in the month they\r\ngave the old lady a second-rate dinner. On these occasions she\r\nhired a little parlour and bedroom behind it in King Street, Saint\r\nJames\'s, and lived a hot, uncomfortable life, going about at nights\r\nto gatherings of fashionable people of which she in her heart\r\ndisapproved, seeking for smiles which seldom came to her, and which\r\nshe excused herself for desiring because they were the smiles of her\r\nkith and her kin, telling herself always that she made this vain\r\njourney to the modern Babylon for the good of Alice Vavasor, and\r\ntelling herself as often that she now made it for the last time. On\r\nthe occasion of her preceding visit she had reminded herself that\r\nshe was then seventy-five years old, and had sworn to herself that\r\nshe would come to London no more; but here she was again in London,\r\nhaving justified the journey to herself on the plea that there were\r\ncircumstances in Alice\'s engagement which made it desirable that she\r\nshould for a while be near her niece. Her niece, as she thought, was\r\nhardly managing her own affairs discreetly.\r\n\r\n"Well, aunt," said Alice, as the old lady walked into the\r\ndrawing-room one morning at eleven o\'clock. Alice always called Lady\r\nMacleod her aunt, though, as has been before explained, there was no\r\nsuch close connexion between them. During Lady Macleod\'s sojourn in\r\nLondon these morning visits were made almost every day. Alice never\r\ndenied herself, and even made a point of remaining at home to receive\r\nthem unless she had previously explained that she would be out; but I\r\nam not prepared to say that they were, of their own nature, agreeable\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind shutting the window, my dear?" said Lady Macleod,\r\nseating herself stiffly on one of the small ugly green chairs. She\r\nhad been educated at a time when easy-chairs were considered vicious,\r\nand among people who regarded all easy postures as being so; and she\r\ncould still boast, at seventy-six, that she never leaned back. "Would\r\nyou mind shutting the window? I\'m so warm that I\'m afraid of the\r\ndraught."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Would you mind shutting the window?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that you\'ve walked from King Street," said\r\nAlice, doing as she was desired.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do,--every step of the way. Cabs are so ruinous. It\'s a\r\nmost unfortunate thing; they always say it\'s just over the two miles\r\nhere. I don\'t believe a word of it, because I\'m only a little more\r\nthan the half-hour walking it; and those men will say anything. But\r\nhow can I prove it, you know?"\r\n\r\n"I really think it\'s too far for you to walk when it\'s so warm."\r\n\r\n"But what can I do, my dear? I must come, when I\'ve specially come up\r\nto London to see you. I shall have a cab back again, because it\'ll\r\nbe hotter then, and dear Lady Midlothian has promised to send her\r\ncarriage at three to take me to the concert. I do so wish you\'d go,\r\nAlice."\r\n\r\n"It\'s out of the question, aunt. The idea of my going in that way at\r\nthe last moment, without any invitation!"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be without an invitation, Alice. The marchioness has\r\nsaid to me over and over again how glad she would be to see you, if\r\nI would bring you."\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t she come and call if she is so anxious to know me?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you\'ve no right to expect it; you haven\'t indeed. She never\r\ncalls even on me."\r\n\r\n"I know I\'ve no right, and I don\'t expect it, and I don\'t want\r\nit. But neither has she a right to suppose that, under such\r\ncircumstances, I shall go to her house. You might as well give it up,\r\naunt. Cart ropes wouldn\'t drag me there."\r\n\r\n"I think you are very wrong,--particularly under your present\r\ncircumstances. A young woman that is going to be married, as you\r\nare--"\r\n\r\n"As I am,--perhaps."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, Alice. Of course you are; and for his sake you are\r\nbound to cultivate any advantages that naturally belong to you. As to\r\nLady Midlothian or the marchioness coming to call on you here in your\r\nfather\'s house, after all that has passed, you really have no right\r\nto look for it."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t look for it."\r\n\r\n"That sort of people are not expected to call. If you\'ll think of it,\r\nhow could they do it with all the demands they have on their time?"\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, I wouldn\'t interfere with their time for worlds."\r\n\r\n"Nobody can say of me, I\'m sure, that I run after great people or\r\nrich people. It does happen that some of the nearest relations I\r\nhave,--indeed I may say the nearest relations,--are people of high\r\nrank; and I do not see that I\'m bound to turn away from my own flesh\r\nand blood because of that, particularly when they are always so\r\nanxious to keep up the connexion."\r\n\r\n"I was only speaking of myself, aunt. It is very different with you.\r\nYou have known them all your life."\r\n\r\n"And how are you to know them if you won\'t begin? Lady Midlothian\r\nsaid to me only yesterday that she was glad to hear that you were\r\ngoing to be married so respectably, and then--"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I\'m very much obliged to her ladyship. I wonder whether\r\nshe considered that she married respectably when she took Lord\r\nMidlothian?"\r\n\r\nNow Lady Midlothian had been unfortunate in her marriage, having\r\nunited herself to a man of bad character, who had used her ill, and\r\nfrom whom she had now been for some years separated. Alice might have\r\nspared her allusion to this misfortune when speaking of the countess\r\nto the cousin who was so fond of her, but she was angered by the\r\napplication of that odious word respectable to her own prospects;\r\nand perhaps the more angered as she was somewhat inclined to feel\r\nthat the epithet did suit her own position. Her engagement, she\r\nhad sometimes told herself, was very respectable, and had as often\r\ntold herself that it lacked other attractions which it should have\r\npossessed. She was not quite pleased with herself in having accepted\r\nJohn Grey,--or rather perhaps was not satisfied with herself in\r\nhaving loved him. In her many thoughts on the subject, she always\r\nadmitted to herself that she had accepted him simply because she\r\nloved him;--that she had given her quick assent to his quick proposal\r\nsimply because he had won her heart. But she was sometimes almost\r\nangry with herself that she had permitted her heart to be thus easily\r\ntaken from her, and had rebuked herself for her girlish facility.\r\nBut the marriage would be at any rate respectable. Mr. Grey was a man\r\nof high character, of good though moderate means; he was, too, well\r\neducated, of good birth, a gentleman, and a man of talent. No one\r\ncould deny that the marriage would be highly respectable, and her\r\nfather had been more than satisfied. Why Miss Vavasor herself was\r\nnot quite satisfied will, I hope, in time make itself appear. In the\r\nmeanwhile it can be understood that Lady Midlothian\'s praise would\r\ngall her.\r\n\r\n"Alice, don\'t be uncharitable," said Lady Macleod severely. "Whatever\r\nmay have been Lady Midlothian\'s misfortunes no one can say they have\r\nresulted from her own fault."\r\n\r\n"Yes they can, aunt, if she married a man whom she knew to be a\r\nscapegrace because he was very rich and an earl."\r\n\r\n"She was the daughter of a nobleman herself, and only married in\r\nher own degree. But I don\'t want to discuss that. She meant to be\r\ngood-natured when she mentioned your marriage, and you should take\r\nit as it was meant. After all she was only your mother\'s second\r\ncousin--"\r\n\r\n"Dear aunt, I make no claim on her cousinship."\r\n\r\n"But she admits the claim, and is quite anxious that you should know\r\nher. She has been at the trouble to find out everything about Mr.\r\nGrey, and told me that nothing could be more satisfactory."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I am very much obliged to her."\r\n\r\nLady Macleod was a woman of much patience, and possessed also\r\nof considerable perseverance. For another half-hour she went on\r\nexpatiating on the advantages which would accrue to Alice as a\r\nmarried woman from an acquaintance with her noble relatives, and\r\nendeavouring to persuade her that no better opportunity than the\r\npresent would present itself. There would be a place in Lady\r\nMidlothian\'s carriage, as none other of the daughters were going but\r\nLady Jane. Lady Midlothian would take it quite as a compliment, and a\r\nconcert was not like a ball or any customary party. An unmarried girl\r\nmight very properly go to a concert under such circumstances as now\r\nexisted without any special invitation. Lady Macleod ought to have\r\nknown her adopted niece better. Alice was immoveable. As a matter\r\nof course she was immoveable. Lady Macleod had seldom been able to\r\npersuade her to anything, and ought to have been well sure that, of\r\nall things, she could not have persuaded her to this.\r\n\r\nThen, at last, they came to another subject, as to which Lady Macleod\r\ndeclared that she had specially come on this special morning,\r\nforgetting, probably, that she had already made the same assertion\r\nwith reference to the concert. But in truth the last assertion was\r\nthe correct one, and on that other subject she had been hurried\r\non to say more than she meant by the eagerness of the moment. All\r\nthe morning she had been full of the matter on which she was now\r\nabout to speak. She had discussed it quite at length with Lady\r\nMidlothian;--though she was by no means prepared to tell Alice\r\nVavasor that any such discussion had taken place. From the concert,\r\nand the effect which Lady Midlothian\'s countenance might have upon\r\nMr. Grey\'s future welfare, she got herself by degrees round to a\r\nprojected Swiss tour which Alice was about to make. Of this Swiss\r\ntour she had heard before, but had not heard who were to be Miss\r\nVavasor\'s companions until Lady Midlothian had told her. How it had\r\ncome to pass that Lady Midlothian had interested herself so much in\r\nthe concerns of a person whom she did not know, and on whom she in\r\nher greatness could not be expected to call, I cannot say; but from\r\nsome quarter she had learned who were the proposed companions of\r\nAlice Vavasor\'s tour, and she had told Lady Macleod that she did not\r\nat all approve of the arrangement.\r\n\r\n"And when do you go, Alice?" said Lady Macleod.\r\n\r\n"Early in July, I believe. It will be very hot, but Kate must be back\r\nby the middle of August." Kate Vavasor was Alice\'s first cousin.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Kate is to go with you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she is. I could not go alone, or with no one but George.\r\nIndeed it was Kate who made up the party."\r\n\r\n"Of course you could not go alone with George," said Lady Macleod,\r\nvery grimly. Now George Vavasor was Kate\'s brother, and was therefore\r\nalso first cousin to Alice. He was heir to the old squire down in\r\nWestmoreland, with whom Kate lived, their father being dead. Nothing,\r\nit would seem, could be more rational than that Alice should go to\r\nSwitzerland with her cousins; but Lady Macleod was clearly not of\r\nthis opinion; she looked very grim as she made this allusion to\r\ncousin George, and seemed to be preparing herself for a fight.\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what I say," answered Alice. "But, indeed, he is\r\nsimply going as an escort to me and Kate, as we don\'t like the role\r\nof unprotected females. It is very good-natured of him, seeing how\r\nmuch his time is taken up."\r\n\r\n"I thought he never did anything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you don\'t know him, aunt."\r\n\r\n"No; certainly I don\'t know him." She did not add that she had no\r\nwish to know Mr. George Vavasor, but she looked it. "And has your\r\nfather been told that he is going?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he has."\r\n\r\n"And does--" Lady Macleod hesitated a little before she went on, and\r\nthen finished her question with a little spasmodic assumption of\r\ncourage. "And does Mr. Grey know that he is going?"\r\n\r\nAlice remained silent for a full minute before she answered this\r\nquestion, during which Lady Macleod sat watching her grimly, with her\r\neyes very intent upon her niece\'s face. If she supposed such silence\r\nto have been in any degree produced by shame in answering the\r\nquestion, she was much mistaken. But it may be doubted whether she\r\nunderstood the character of the girl whom she thought she knew so\r\nwell, and it is probable that she did make such mistake.\r\n\r\n"I might tell you simply that he does," said Alice at last, "seeing\r\nthat I wrote to him yesterday, letting him know that such were our\r\narrangements; but I feel that I should not thus answer the question\r\nyou mean to ask. You want to know whether Mr. Grey will approve of it.\r\nAs I only wrote yesterday of course I have not heard, and therefore\r\ncannot say. But I can say this, aunt, that much as I might regret his\r\ndisapproval, it would make no change in my plans."\r\n\r\n"Would it not? Then I must tell you, you are very wrong. It ought\r\nto make a change. What! the disapproval of the man you are going to\r\nmarry make no change in your plans?"\r\n\r\n"Not in that matter. Come, aunt, if we must discuss this matter let\r\nus do it at any rate fairly. In an ordinary way, if Mr. Grey had asked\r\nme to give up for any reason my trip altogether, I should have given\r\nit up certainly, as I would give up any other indifferent project at\r\nthe request of so dear a friend,--a friend with whom I am so--so--so\r\nclosely connected. But if he asked me not to travel with my cousin\r\nGeorge, I should refuse him absolutely, without a word of parley\r\non the subject, simply because of the nature and closeness of my\r\nconnection with him. I suppose you understand what I mean, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I do. You mean that you would refuse to obey him on the\r\nvery subject on which he has a right to claim your obedience."\r\n\r\n"He has no right to claim my obedience on any subject," said Alice;\r\nand as she spoke Aunt Macleod jumped up with a little start at the\r\nvehemence of the words, and of the tone in which they were expressed.\r\nShe had heard that tone before, and might have been used to it; but,\r\nnevertheless, the little jump was involuntary. "At present he has no\r\nright to my obedience on any subject, but least of all on that," said\r\nAlice. "His advice he may give me, but I am quite sure he will not\r\nask for obedience."\r\n\r\n"And if he advises you you will slight his advice."\r\n\r\n"If he tells me that I had better not travel with my cousin George I\r\nshall certainly not take his advice. Moreover, I should be careful to\r\nlet him know how much I was offended by any such counsel from him.\r\nIt would show a littleness on his part, and a suspicion of which I\r\ncannot suppose him to be capable." Alice, as she said this, got up\r\nfrom her seat and walked about the room. When she had finished she\r\nstood at one of the windows with her back to her visitor. There was\r\nsilence between them for a minute or two, during which Lady Macleod\r\nwas deeply considering how best she might speak the terrible words,\r\nwhich, as Alice\'s nearest female relative, she felt herself bound to\r\nutter. At last she collected her thoughts and her courage, and spoke\r\nout.\r\n\r\n"My dear Alice, I need hardly say that if you had a mother living,\r\nor any person with you filling the place of a mother, I should not\r\ninterfere in this matter."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Aunt Macleod, if you think I am wrong you have quite a\r\nright to say so."\r\n\r\n"I do think you are wrong,--very wrong, indeed; and if you persist in\r\nthis I am afraid I must say that I shall think you wicked. Of course\r\nMr. Grey cannot like you to travel with George Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"And why not, aunt?" Alice, as she asked this question, turned round\r\nand confronted Lady Macleod boldly. She spoke with a steady voice,\r\nand fixed her eyes upon the old lady\'s face, as though determined to\r\nshow that she had no fear of what might be said to her.\r\n\r\n"Why not, Alice? Surely you do not wish me to say why not."\r\n\r\n"But I do wish you to say why not. How can I defend myself till the\r\naccusation is made?"\r\n\r\n"You are now engaged to marry Mr. Grey, with the consent and\r\napprobation of all your friends. Two years ago you had--had--"\r\n\r\n"Had what, aunt? If you mean to say that two years ago I was engaged\r\nto my cousin George you are mistaken. Three years ago I told him\r\nthat under certain conditions I would become engaged to him. But my\r\nconditions did not suit him, nor his me, and no engagement was ever\r\nmade. Mr. Grey knows the history of the whole thing. As far as it was\r\npossible I have told him everything that took place."\r\n\r\n"The fact was, Alice, that George Vavasor\'s mode of life was such\r\nthat an engagement with him would have been absolute madness."\r\n\r\n"Dear aunt, you must excuse me if I say that I cannot discuss George\r\nVavasor\'s mode of life. If I were thinking of becoming his wife you\r\nwould have a perfect right to discuss it, because of your constant\r\nkindness to me. But as matters are he is simply a cousin; and as I\r\nlike him and you do not, we had better say nothing about him."\r\n\r\n"I must say this--that after what has passed, and at the present\r\ncrisis of your life--"\r\n\r\n"Dear aunt, I\'m not in any crisis."\r\n\r\n"Yes you are, Alice; in the most special crisis of a girl\'s life. You\r\nare still a girl, but you are the promised wife of a very worthy man,\r\nwho will look to you for all his domestic happiness. George Vavasor\r\nhas the name, at least, of being very wild."\r\n\r\n"The worthy man and the wild man must fight it out between them. If I\r\nwere going away with George by himself, there might be something in\r\nwhat you say."\r\n\r\n"That would be monstrous."\r\n\r\n"Monstrous or not, it isn\'t what I\'m about to do. Kate and I have put\r\nour purses together, and are going to have an outing for our special\r\nfun and gratification. As we should be poor travellers alone, George\r\nhas promised to go with his sister. Papa knows all about it, and\r\nnever thought of making any objection."\r\n\r\nLady Macleod shook her head. She did not like to say anything against\r\nMr. Vavasor before his daughter; but the shaking of her head was\r\nintended to signify that Mr. Vavasor\'s assent in such a matter was\r\nworth nothing.\r\n\r\n"I can only say again," said Lady Macleod, "that I think Mr. Grey\r\nwill be displeased,--and that he will have very great cause for\r\ndispleasure. And I think, moreover, that his approbation ought to be\r\nyour chief study. I believe, my dear, I\'ll ask you to let Jane get me\r\na cab. I shan\'t have a bit too much time to dress for the concert."\r\n\r\nAlice simply rang the bell, and said no further word on the subject\r\nwhich they had been discussing. When Lady Macleod got up to go away,\r\nAlice kissed her, as was customary with them, and the old lady as\r\nshe went uttered her customary valediction. "God bless you, my dear.\r\nGood-bye! I\'ll come to-morrow if I can." There was therefore no\r\nquarrel between them. But both of them felt that words had been\r\nspoken which must probably lead to some diminution of their past\r\nintimacy.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Macleod had gone Alice sat alone for an hour thinking of\r\nwhat had passed between them,--thinking rather of those two men, the\r\nworthy man and the wild man, whose names had been mentioned in close\r\nconnection with herself. John Grey was a worthy man, a man worthy at\r\nall points, as far as she knew him. She told herself it was so. And\r\nshe told herself, also, that her cousin George was wild,--very wild.\r\nAnd yet her thoughts were, I fear, on the whole more kindly towards\r\nher cousin than towards her lover. She had declared to her aunt that\r\nJohn Grey would be incapable of such suspicion as would be shown by\r\nany objection on his part to the arrangements made for the tour. She\r\nhad said so, and had so believed; and yet she continued to brood\r\nover the position which her affairs would take, if he did make the\r\nobjection which Lady Macleod anticipated. She told herself over and\r\nover again, that under such circumstances she would not give way an\r\ninch. "He is free to go," she said to herself. "If he does not trust\r\nme he is quite free to go." It may almost be said that she came at\r\nlast to anticipate from her lover that very answer to her own letter\r\nwhich she had declared him to be incapable of making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nJohn Grey, the Worthy Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Grey\'s answer to Alice Vavasor\'s letter, which was duly sent by\r\nreturn of post and duly received on the morning after Lady Macleod\'s\r\nvisit, may perhaps be taken as giving a sample of his worthiness. It\r\nwas dated from Nethercoats, a small country-house in Cambridgeshire\r\nwhich belonged to him, at which he already spent much of his time,\r\nand at which he intended to live altogether after his marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Nethercoats, June, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST ALICE,\r\n\r\n   I am glad you have settled your affairs,--foreign affairs,\r\n   I mean,--so much to your mind. As to your home affairs\r\n   they are not, to my thinking, quite so satisfactorily\r\n   arranged. But as I am a party interested in the latter my\r\n   opinion may perhaps have an undue bias. Touching the tour,\r\n   I quite agree with you that you and Kate would have been\r\n   uncomfortable alone. It\'s a very fine theory, that of\r\n   women being able to get along without men as well as with\r\n   them; but, like other fine theories, it will be found very\r\n   troublesome by those who first put it in practice. Gloved\r\n   hands, petticoats, feminine softness, and the general\r\n   homage paid to beauty, all stand in the way of success.\r\n   These things may perhaps some day be got rid of, and\r\n   possibly with advantage; but while young ladies are still\r\n   encumbered with them a male companion will always be found\r\n   to be a comfort. I don\'t quite know whether your cousin\r\n   George is the best possible knight you might have chosen.\r\n   I should consider myself to be infinitely preferable,\r\n   had my going been upon the cards. Were you in danger\r\n   of meeting Paynim foes, he, no doubt, would kill them\r\n   off much quicker than I could do, and would be much\r\n   more serviceable in liberating you from the dungeons\r\n   of oppressors, or even from stray tigers in the Swiss\r\n   forests. But I doubt his being punctual with the luggage.\r\n   He will want you or Kate to keep the accounts, if any are\r\n   kept. He will be slow in getting you glasses of water at\r\n   the railway stations, and will always keep you waiting at\r\n   breakfast. I hold that a man with two ladies on a tour\r\n   should be an absolute slave to them, or they will not\r\n   fully enjoy themselves. He should simply be an upper\r\n   servant, with the privilege of sitting at the same table\r\n   with his mistresses. I have my doubts as to whether your\r\n   cousin is fit for the place; but, as to myself, it is just\r\n   the thing that I was made for. Luckily, however, neither\r\n   you nor Kate are without wills of your own, and perhaps\r\n   you may be able to reduce Mr. Vavasor to obedience.\r\n\r\n   As to the home affairs I have very little to say here,--in\r\n   this letter. I shall of course run up and see you before\r\n   you start, and shall probably stay a week in town. I know\r\n   I ought not to do so, as it will be a week of idleness,\r\n   and yet not a week of happiness. I\'d sooner have an hour\r\n   with you in the country than a whole day in London. And I\r\n   always feel in town that I\'ve too much to do to allow of\r\n   my doing anything. If it were sheer idleness I could enjoy\r\n   it, but it is a feverish idleness, in which one is driven\r\n   here and there, expecting some gratification which not\r\n   only never comes, but which never even begins to come. I\r\n   will, however, undergo a week of it,--say the last seven\r\n   days of this month, and shall trust to you to recompense\r\n   me by as much of yourself as your town doings will permit.\r\n\r\n   And now again as to those home affairs. If I say nothing\r\n   now I believe you will understand why I refrain. You\r\n   have cunningly just left me to imply, from what you say,\r\n   that all my arguments have been of no avail; but you do\r\n   not answer them, or even tell me that you have decided.\r\n   I shall therefore imply nothing, and still trust to my\r\n   personal eloquence for success. Or rather not trust,--not\r\n   trust, but hope.\r\n\r\n   The garden is going on very well. We are rather short of\r\n   water, and therefore not quite as bright as I had hoped;\r\n   but we are preparing with untiring industry for future\r\n   brightness. Your commands have been obeyed in all things,\r\n   and Morrison always says "The mistress didn\'t mean this,"\r\n   or "The mistress did intend that." God bless the mistress\r\n   is what I now say, and send her home, to her own home,\r\n   to her flowers, and her fruit, and her house, and her\r\n   husband, as soon as may be, with no more of these delays\r\n   which are to me so grievous, and which seem to me to be\r\n   so unnecessary. That is my prayer.\r\n\r\n   Yours ever and always,\r\n\r\n   J. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t give commands," Alice said to herself, as she sat with the\r\nletter at her solitary breakfast-table. "He asked me how I liked the\r\nthings, and of course I was obliged to say. I was obliged to seem to\r\ncare, even if I didn\'t care." Such were her first thoughts as she put\r\nthe letter back into its envelope, after reading it the second time.\r\nWhen she opened it, which she did quickly, not pausing a moment\r\nlest she should suspect herself of fearing to see what might be\r\nits contents, her mind was full of that rebuke which her aunt had\r\nanticipated, and which she had almost taught herself to expect. She\r\nhad torn the letter open rapidly, and had dashed at its contents with\r\nquick eyes. In half a moment she had seen what was the nature of the\r\nreply respecting the proposed companion of her tour, and then she had\r\ncompleted her reading slowly enough. "No; I gave no commands," she\r\nrepeated to herself, as though she might thereby absolve herself from\r\nblame in reference to some possible future accusations, which might\r\nperhaps be brought against her under certain circumstances which she\r\nwas contemplating.\r\n\r\nThen she considered the letter bit by bit, taking it backwards, and\r\nsipping her tea every now and then amidst her thoughts. No; she had\r\nno home, no house, there. She had no husband;--not as yet. He spoke\r\nof their engagement as though it were a betrothal, as betrothals used\r\nto be of yore; as though they were already in some sort married. Such\r\nbetrothals were not made now-a-days. There still remained, both to\r\nhim and to her, a certain liberty of extricating themselves from this\r\nengagement. Should he come to her and say that he found that their\r\ncontemplated marriage would not make him happy, would not she release\r\nhim without a word of reproach? Would not she regard him as much\r\nmore honourable in doing so than in adhering to a marriage which was\r\ndistasteful to him? And if she would so judge him,--judge him and\r\ncertainly acquit him, was it not reasonable that she under similar\r\ncircumstances should expect a similar acquittal? Then she declared\r\nto herself that she carried on this argument within her own breast\r\nsimply as an argument, induced to do so by that assertion on his part\r\nthat he was already her husband,--that his house was even now her\r\nhome. She had no intention of using that power which was still hers.\r\nShe had no wish to go back from her pledged word. She thought that\r\nshe had no such wish. She loved him much, and admired him even more\r\nthan she loved him. He was noble, generous, clever, good,--so good as\r\nto be almost perfect; nay, for aught she knew he was perfect. Would\r\nthat he had some faults! Would that he had! Would that he had! How\r\ncould she, full of faults as she knew herself to be,--how could she\r\nhope to make happy a man perfect as he was! But then there would\r\nbe no doubt as to her present duty. She loved him, and that was\r\neverything. Having told him that she loved him, and having on that\r\nscore accepted his love, nothing but a change in her heart towards\r\nhim could justify her in seeking to break the bond which bound them\r\ntogether. She did love him, and she loved him only.\r\n\r\nBut she had once loved her cousin. Yes, truly it was so. In her\r\nthoughts she did not now deny it. She had loved him, and was\r\ntormented by a feeling that she had had a more full delight in that\r\nlove than in this other that had sprung up subsequently. She had told\r\nherself that this had come of her youth;--that love at twenty was\r\nsweeter than it could be afterwards. There had been a something of\r\nrapture in that earlier dream which could never be repeated,--which\r\ncould never live, indeed, except in a dream. Now, now that she was\r\nolder and perhaps wiser, love meant a partnership, in which each\r\npartner would be honest to the other, in which each would wish and\r\nstrive for the other\'s welfare, so that thus their joint welfare\r\nmight be insured. Then, in those early girlish days, it had meant\r\na total abnegation of self. The one was of earth, and therefore\r\npossible. The other had been a ray from heaven,--and impossible,\r\nexcept in a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd she had been mistaken in her first love. She admitted that\r\nfrankly. He whom she had worshipped had been an idol of clay, and she\r\nknew that it was well for her to have abandoned that idolatry. He had\r\nnot only been untrue to her, but, worse than that, had been false in\r\nexcusing his untruth. He had not only promised falsely, but had made\r\nsuch promises with a deliberate, premeditated falsehood. And he had\r\nbeen selfish, coldly selfish, weighing the value of his own low lusts\r\nagainst that of her holy love. She had known this, and had parted\r\nfrom him with an oath to herself that no promised contrition on his\r\npart should ever bring them again together. But she had pardoned him\r\nas a man, though never as a lover, and had bade him welcome again\r\nas a cousin and as her friend\'s brother. She had again become very\r\nanxious as to his career, not hiding her regard, but professing that\r\nanxiety aloud. She knew him to be clever, ambitious, bold,--and she\r\nbelieved even yet, in spite of her own experience, that he might not\r\nbe bad at heart. Now, as she told herself that in truth she loved the\r\nman to whom her troth was plighted, I fear that she almost thought\r\nmore of that other man from whom she had torn herself asunder.\r\n\r\n"Why should he find himself unhappy in London?" she said, as she went\r\nback to the letter. "Why should he pretend to condemn the very place\r\nwhich most men find the fittest for all their energies? Were I a man,\r\nno earthly consideration should induce me to live elsewhere. It is\r\nodd how we differ in all things. However brilliant might be his own\r\nlight, he would be contented to hide it under a bushel!"\r\n\r\nAnd at last she recurred to that matter as to which she had been\r\nso anxious when she first opened her lover\'s letter. It will be\r\nremembered how assured she had expressed herself that Mr. Grey would\r\nnot condescend to object to her travelling with her cousin. He had\r\nnot so condescended. He had written on the matter with a pleasant\r\njoke, like a gentleman as he was, disdaining to allude to the past\r\npassages in the life of her whom he loved, abstaining even from\r\nexpressing anything that might be taken as a permission on his part.\r\nThere had been in Alice\'s words, as she told him of their proposed\r\nplan, a something that had betrayed a tremor in her thoughts. She\r\nhad studiously striven so to frame her phrases that her tale might\r\nbe told as any other simple statement,--as though there had been no\r\ntrembling in her mind as she wrote. But she had failed, and she knew\r\nthat she had failed. She had failed; and he had read all her effort\r\nand all her failure. She was quite conscious of this; she felt it\r\nthoroughly; and she knew that he was noble and a gentleman to the\r\nlast drop of his blood. And yet--yet--yet there was almost a feeling\r\nof disappointment in that he had not written such a letter as Lady\r\nMacleod had anticipated.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week Lady Macleod still came almost daily to Queen\r\nAnne Street, but nothing further was said between her and Miss\r\nVavasor as to the Swiss tour; nor were any questions asked about Mr.\r\nGrey\'s opinion on the subject. The old lady of course discovered\r\nthat there was no quarrel, or, as she believed, any probability of a\r\nquarrel; and with that she was obliged to be contented. Nor did she\r\nagain on this occasion attempt to take Alice to Lady Midlothian\'s.\r\nIndeed, their usual subjects of conversation were almost abandoned,\r\nand Lady Macleod\'s visits, though they were as constant as\r\nheretofore, were not so long. She did not dare to talk about Mr. Grey,\r\nand because she did not so dare, was determined to regard herself as\r\nin a degree ill-used. So she was silent, reserved, and fretful. At\r\nlength came the last day of her London season, and her last visit\r\nto her niece. "I would come because it\'s my last day," said Lady\r\nMacleod; "but really I\'m so hurried, and have so many things to do,\r\nthat I hardly know how to manage it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind," said Alice, giving her aunt an affectionate squeeze\r\nof the hand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m keeping the cab, so I can just stay twenty-five minutes. I\'ve\r\nmarked the time accurately, but I know the man will swear it\'s over\r\nthe half-hour."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have no more trouble about cabs, aunt, when you are back in\r\nCheltenham."\r\n\r\n"The flies are worse, my dear. I really think they\'re worse. I pay\r\nthe bill every month, but they\'ve always one down that I didn\'t have.\r\nIt\'s the regular practice, for I\'ve had them from all the men in the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard enough to find honest men anywhere, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Or honest women either. What do you think of Mrs. Green wanting to\r\ncharge me for an extra week, because she says I didn\'t give her\r\nnotice till Tuesday morning? I won\'t pay her, and she may stop my\r\nthings if she dares. However, it\'s the last time. I shall never come\r\nup to London again, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt, don\'t say that!"\r\n\r\n"But I do say it, my dear. What should an old woman like me do,\r\ntrailing up to town every year, merely because it\'s what people\r\nchoose to call the season."\r\n\r\n"To see your friends, of course. Age doesn\'t matter when a person\'s\r\nhealth is so good as yours."\r\n\r\n"If you knew what I suffer from lumbago,--though I must say coming\r\nto London always does cure that for the time. But as for friends--!\r\nWell, I suppose one has no right to complain when one gets to be as\r\nold as I am; but I declare I believe that those I love best would\r\nsooner be without me than with me."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean me, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, I don\'t mean you. Of course my life would have been\r\nvery different if you could have consented to remain with me till you\r\nwere married. But I didn\'t mean you. I don\'t know that I meant any\r\none. You shouldn\'t mind what an old woman like me says."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a little melancholy because you\'re going away."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I don\'t know why I stayed the last week. I did say to\r\nLady Midlothian that I thought I should go on the 20th; and, though I\r\nknow that she knew that I really didn\'t go, she has not once sent to\r\nme since. To be sure they\'ve been out every night; but I thought she\r\nmight have asked me to come and lunch. It\'s so very lonely dining by\r\nmyself in lodgings in London."\r\n\r\n"And yet you never will come and dine with me."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; no. But we won\'t talk about that. I\'ve just one word\r\nmore to say. Let me see. I\'ve just six minutes to stay. I\'ve made\r\nup my mind that I\'ll never come up to town again,--except for one\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s that, aunt?" Alice, as she asked the question, well knew\r\nwhat that one thing was.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come for your marriage, my dear. I do hope you will not keep me\r\nlong waiting."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I can\'t make any promise. There\'s no knowing when that may be."\r\n\r\n"And why should there be no knowing? I always think that when a girl\r\nis once engaged the sooner she\'s married the better. There may be\r\nreasons for delay on the gentleman\'s part."\r\n\r\n"There very often are, you know,"\r\n\r\n"But, Alice, you don\'t mean to say that Mr. Grey is putting it off?"\r\n\r\nAlice was silent for a moment, during which Lady Macleod\'s face\r\nassumed a look of almost tragic horror. Was there something wrong on\r\nMr. Grey\'s side of which she was altogether unaware? Alice, though for\r\na second or two she had been guilty of a slight playful deceit, was\r\ntoo honest to allow the impression to remain. "No, aunt," she said;\r\n"Mr. Grey is not putting it off. It has been left to me to fix the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And why don\'t you fix it?"\r\n\r\n"It is such a serious thing! After all it is not more than four\r\nmonths yet since I--I accepted him. I don\'t know that there has been\r\nany delay."\r\n\r\n"But you might fix the time now, if he wishes it."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps I shall,--some day, aunt. I\'m going to think about it,\r\nand you mustn\'t drive me."\r\n\r\n"But you should have some one to advise you, Alice."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s just it. People always do seem to think it so terrible\r\nthat a girl should have her own way in anything. She mustn\'t like any\r\none at first; and then, when she does like some one, she must marry\r\nhim directly she\'s bidden. I haven\'t much of my own way at present;\r\nbut you see, when I\'m married I shan\'t have it at all. You can\'t\r\nwonder that I shouldn\'t be in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"I am not advocating anything like hurry, my dear. But, goodness\r\ngracious me! I\'ve been here twenty-eight minutes, and that horrid\r\nman will impose upon me. Good-bye; God bless you! Mind you write."\r\nAnd Lady Macleod hurried out of the room more intent at the present\r\nmoment upon saving her sixpence than she was on any other matter\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nAnd then John Grey came up to town, arriving a day or two after the\r\ntime that he had fixed. It is not, perhaps, improbable that Alice\r\nhad used some diplomatic skill in preventing a meeting between Lady\r\nMacleod and her lover. They both were very anxious to obtain the same\r\nobject, and Alice was to some extent opposed to their views. Had Lady\r\nMacleod and John Grey put their forces together she might have found\r\nherself unable to resist their joint endeavours. She was resolved\r\nthat she would not at any rate name any day for her marriage before\r\nher return from Switzerland; and she may therefore have thought it\r\nwise to keep Mr. Grey in the country till after Lady Macleod had gone,\r\neven though she thereby cut down the time of his sojourn in London\r\nto four days. On the occasion of that visit Mr. Vavasor did a very\r\nmemorable thing. He dined at home with the view of welcoming his\r\nfuture son-in-law. He dined at home, and asked, or rather assented\r\nto Alice\'s asking, George and Kate Vavasor to join the dinner-party.\r\n"What an auspicious omen for the future nuptials!" said Kate, with\r\nher little sarcastic smile. "Uncle John dines at home, and Mr. Grey\r\njoins in the dissipation of a dinner-party. We shall all be changed\r\nsoon, I suppose, and George and I will take to keeping a little\r\ncottage in the country."\r\n\r\n"Kate," said Alice, angrily, "I think you are about the most unjust\r\nperson I ever met. I would forgive your raillery, however painful it\r\nmight be, if it were only fair."\r\n\r\n"And to whom is it unfair on the present occasion;--to your father?"\r\n\r\n"It was not intended for him."\r\n\r\n"To yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I care nothing as to myself; you know that very well."\r\n\r\n"Then it must have been unfair to Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it was Mr. Grey whom you meant to attack. If I can forgive him\r\nfor not caring for society, surely you might do so."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; but that\'s just what you can\'t do, my dear. You don\'t\r\nforgive him. If you did you might be quite sure that I should say\r\nnothing. And if you choose to bid me hold my tongue I will say\r\nnothing. But when you tell me all your own thoughts about this\r\nthing you can hardly expect but that I should let you know mine in\r\nreturn. I\'m not particular; and if you are ready for a little good,\r\nwholesome, useful hypocrisy, I won\'t balk you. I mayn\'t be quite so\r\ndishonest as you call me, but I\'m not so wedded to truth but what I\r\ncan look, and act, and speak a few falsehoods if you wish it. Only\r\nlet us understand each other."\r\n\r\n"You know I wish for no falsehood, Kate."\r\n\r\n"I know it\'s very hard to understand what you do wish. I know that\r\nfor the last year or two I have been trying to find out your wishes,\r\nand, upon my word, my success has been very indifferent. I suppose\r\nyou wish to marry Mr. Grey, but I\'m by no means certain. I suppose the\r\nlast thing on earth you\'d wish would be to marry George?"\r\n\r\n"The very last. You\'re right there at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Alice--! sometimes you drive me too hard; you do, indeed. You make\r\nme doubt whether I hate or love you most. Knowing what my feelings\r\nare about George, I cannot understand how you can bring yourself to\r\nspeak of him to me with such contempt!" Kate Vavasor, as she spoke\r\nthese words, left the room with a quick step, and hurried up to her\r\nown chamber. There Alice found her in tears, and was driven by her\r\nfriend\'s real grief into the expression of an apology, which she\r\nknew was not properly due from her. Kate was acquainted with all the\r\ncircumstances of that old affair between her brother and Alice. She\r\nhad given in her adhesion to the propriety of what Alice had done.\r\nShe had allowed that her brother George\'s behaviour had been such as\r\nto make any engagement between them impossible. The fault, therefore,\r\nhad been hers in making any reference to the question of such a\r\nmarriage. Nor had it been by any means her first fault of the same\r\nkind. Till Alice had become engaged to Mr. Grey she had spoken of\r\nGeorge only as her brother, or as her friend\'s cousin, but now she\r\nwas constantly making allusion to those past occurrences, which all\r\nof them should have striven to forget. Under these circumstances was\r\nnot Lady Macleod right in saying that George Vavasor should not have\r\nbeen accepted as a companion for the Swiss tour?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Sometimes you drive me too hard."]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little dinner-party went off very quietly; and if no other ground\r\nexisted for charging Mr. Grey with London dissipation than what that\r\nafforded, he was accused most unjustly. The two young men had never\r\nbefore met each other; and Vavasor had gone to his uncle\'s house,\r\nprepared not only to dislike but to despise his successor in Alice\'s\r\nfavour. But in this he was either disappointed or gratified, as the\r\ncase may be. "He has plenty to say for himself," he said to Kate on\r\nhis way home.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; he can talk."\r\n\r\n"And he doesn\'t talk like a prig either, which was what I expected.\r\nHe\'s uncommonly handsome."\r\n\r\n"I thought men never saw that in each other. I never see it in any\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I see it in every animal--in men, women, horses, dogs, and even\r\npigs. I like to look on handsome things. I think people always do who\r\nare ugly themselves."\r\n\r\n"And so you\'re going into raptures in favour of John Grey."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. I very seldom go into raptures about anything. But he\r\ntalks in the way I like a man to talk. How he bowled my uncle over\r\nabout those actors; and yet if my uncle knows anything about anything\r\nit is about the stage twenty years ago." There was nothing more said\r\nthen about John Grey; but Kate understood her brother well enough to\r\nbe aware that this praise meant very little. George Vavasor spoke\r\nsometimes from his heart, and did so more frequently to his sister\r\nthan to any one else; but his words came generally from his head.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the little dinner in Queen Anne Street, John Grey\r\ncame to say good-bye to his betrothed;--for his betrothed she\r\ncertainly was, in spite of those very poor arguments which she had\r\nused in trying to convince herself that she was still free if she\r\nwished to claim her freedom. Though he had been constantly with Alice\r\nduring the last three days, he had not hitherto said anything as to\r\nthe day of their marriage. He had been constantly with her alone,\r\nsitting for hours in that ugly green drawing-room, but he had never\r\ntouched the subject. He had told her much of Switzerland, which she\r\nhad never yet seen but which he knew well. He had told her much of\r\nhis garden and house, whither she had once gone with her father,\r\nwhilst paying a visit nominally to the colleges at Cambridge. And he\r\nhad talked of various matters, matters bearing in no immediate way\r\nupon his own or her affairs; for Mr. Grey was a man who knew well how\r\nto make words pleasant; but previous to this last moment he had said\r\nnothing on that subject on which he was so intent.\r\n\r\n"Well, Alice," he said, when the last hour had come, "and about that\r\nquestion of home affairs?"\r\n\r\n"Let us finish off the foreign affairs first."\r\n\r\n"We have finished them; haven\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Finished them! why we haven\'t started yet."\r\n\r\n"No; you haven\'t started. But we\'ve had the discussion. Is there any\r\nreason why you\'d rather not have this thing settled."\r\n\r\n"No; no special reason."\r\n\r\n"Then why not let it be fixed? Do you fear coming to me as my wife?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I cannot think that you repent your goodness to me."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t repent it;--what you call my goodness? I love you too\r\nentirely for that."\r\n\r\n"My darling!" And now he passed his arm round her waist as they stood\r\nnear the empty fireplace. "And if you love me--"\r\n\r\n"I do love you."\r\n\r\n"Then why should you not wish to come to me?"\r\n\r\n"I do wish it. I think I wish it."\r\n\r\n"But, Alice, you must have wished it altogether when you consented to\r\nbe my wife."\r\n\r\n"A person may wish for a thing altogether, and yet not wish for it\r\ninstantly."\r\n\r\n"Instantly! Come; I have not been hard on you. This is still June.\r\nWill you say the middle of September, and we shall still be in time\r\nfor warm pleasant days among the lakes? Is that asking for too much?"\r\n\r\n"It is not asking for anything."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but it is, love. Grant it, and I will swear that you have\r\ngranted me everything."\r\n\r\nShe was silent, having things to say but not knowing in what words to\r\nput them. Now that he was with her she could not say the things which\r\nshe had told herself that she would utter to him. She could not bring\r\nherself to hint to him that his views of life were so unlike her own,\r\nthat there could be no chance of happiness between them, unless each\r\ncould strive to lean somewhat towards the other. No man could be more\r\ngracious in word and manner than John Grey; no man more chivalrous in\r\nhis carriage towards a woman; but he always spoke and acted as though\r\nthere could be no question that his manner of life was to be adopted,\r\nwithout a word or thought of doubting, by his wife. When two came\r\ntogether, why should not each yield something, and each claim\r\nsomething? This she had meant to say to him on this day; but now that\r\nhe was with her she could not say it.\r\n\r\n"John," she said at last, "do not press me about this till I return."\r\n\r\n"But then you will say the time is short. It would be short then."\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer you now;--indeed, I cannot. That is I cannot answer\r\nin the affirmative. It is such a solemn thing."\r\n\r\n"Will it ever be less solemn, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"Never, I hope never."\r\n\r\nHe did not press her further then, but kissed her and bade her\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor, the Wild Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will no doubt be understood that George Vavasor did not roam about\r\nin the woods unshorn, or wear leathern trappings and sandals, like\r\nRobinson Crusoe, instead of coats and trousers. His wildness was of\r\nanother kind. Indeed, I don\'t know that he was in truth at all wild,\r\nthough Lady Macleod had called him so, and Alice had assented to her\r\nuse of the word.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor had lived in London since he was twenty, and now, at\r\nthe time of the beginning of my story, he was a year or two over\r\nthirty. He was and ever had been the heir to his grandfather\'s\r\nestate; but that estate was small, and when George first came to\r\nLondon his father was a strong man of forty, with as much promise\r\nof life in him as his son had. A profession had therefore been\r\nabsolutely necessary to him; and he had, at his uncle John\'s\r\ninstance, been placed in the office of a parliamentary land agent.\r\nWith this parliamentary land agent he had quarrelled to the knife,\r\nbut not before he had by his talents made himself so useful that\r\nhe had before him the prospects of a lucrative partnership in the\r\nbusiness. George Vavasor had many faults, but idleness--absolute\r\nidleness--was not one of them. He would occasionally postpone his\r\nwork to pleasure. He would be at Newmarket when he should have been\r\nat Whitehall. But it was not usual with him to be in bed when he\r\nshould be at his desk, and when he was at his desk he did not whittle\r\nhis ruler, or pick his teeth, or clip his nails. Upon the whole\r\nhis friends were pleased with the first five years of his life in\r\nLondon--in spite of his having been found to be in debt on more than\r\none occasion. But his debts had been paid; and all was going on\r\nswimmingly, when one day he knocked down the parliamentary agent\r\nwith a blow between the eyes, and then there was an end of that.\r\nHe himself was wont to say that he had known very well what he was\r\nabout, that it had behoved him to knock down the man who was to have\r\nbeen his partner, and that he regretted nothing in the matter. At any\r\nrate the deed was looked upon with approving eyes by many men of good\r\nstanding,--or, at any rate, sufficient standing to help George to\r\nanother position; and within six weeks of the time of his leaving the\r\noffice at Whitehall, he had become a partner in an established firm\r\nof wine merchants. A great-aunt had just then left him a couple of\r\nthousand pounds, which no doubt assisted him in his views with the\r\nwine merchants.\r\n\r\nIn this employment he remained for another period of five years, and\r\nwas supposed by all his friends to be doing very well. And indeed\r\nhe did not do badly, only that he did not do well enough to satisfy\r\nhimself. He was ambitious of making the house to which he belonged\r\nthe first house in the trade in London, and scared his partners by\r\nthe boldness and extent of his views. He himself declared that if\r\nthey would only have gone along with him he would have made them\r\nprinces in the wine market. But they were men either of more prudence\r\nor of less audacity than he, and they declined to walk in his\r\ncourses. At the end of the five years Vavasor left the house, not\r\nhaving knocked any one down on this occasion, and taking with him a\r\nvery nice sum of money.\r\n\r\nThe two last of these five years had certainly been the best period\r\nof his life, for he had really worked very hard, like a man, giving\r\nup all pleasure that took time from him,--and giving up also most\r\npleasures which were dangerous on account of their costliness. He\r\nwent to no races, played no billiards, and spoke of Cremorne as a\r\nchildish thing, which he had abandoned now that he was no longer\r\na child. It was during these two years that he had had his love\r\npassages with his cousin; and it must be presumed that he had, at any\r\nrate, intended at one time to settle himself respectably as a married\r\nman. He had, however, behaved very badly to Alice, and the match had\r\nbeen broken off.\r\n\r\nHe had also during the last two years quarrelled with his\r\ngrandfather. He had wished to raise a sum of money on the Vavasor\r\nestate, which, as it was unentailed, he could only do with his\r\ngrandfather\'s concurrence. The old gentleman would not hear of\r\nit,--would listen with no patience to the proposition. It was in\r\nvain that George attempted to make the squire understand that the\r\nwine business was going on very well, that he himself owed no man\r\nanything, that everything with him was flourishing;--but that his\r\ntrade might be extended indefinitely by the use of a few thousand\r\npounds at moderate interest. Old Mr. Vavasor was furious. No documents\r\nand no assurances could make him lay aside a belief that the wine\r\nmerchants, and the business, and his grandson were all ruined and\r\nruinous together. No one but a ruined man would attempt to raise\r\nmoney on the family estate! So they had quarrelled, and had never\r\nspoken or seen each other since. "He shall have the estate for his\r\nlife," the squire said to his son John. "I don\'t think I have a right\r\nto leave it away from him. It never has been left away from the heir.\r\nBut I\'ll tie it up so that he shan\'t cut a tree on it." John Vavasor\r\nperhaps thought that the old rule of primogeniture might under such\r\ncircumstances have been judiciously abandoned--in this one instance,\r\nin his own favour. But he did not say so. Nor would he have said it\r\nhad there been a chance of his doing so with success. He was a man\r\nfrom whom no very noble deed could be expected; but he was also one\r\nwho would do no ignoble deed.\r\n\r\nAfter that George Vavasor had become a stockbroker, and a stockbroker\r\nhe was now. In the first twelve months after his leaving the wine\r\nbusiness,--the same being the first year after his breach with\r\nAlice,--he had gone back greatly in the estimation of men. He had\r\nlived in open defiance of decency. He had spent much money and had\r\napparently made none, and had been, as all his friends declared, on\r\nthe high road to ruin. Aunt Macleod had taken her judgement from this\r\nperiod of his life when she had spoken of him as a man who never did\r\nanything. But he had come forth again suddenly as a working man; and\r\nnow they who professed to know, declared that he was by no means\r\npoor. He was in the City every day; and during the last two years had\r\nearned the character of a shrewd fellow who knew what he was about,\r\nwho might not perhaps be very mealy-mouthed in affairs of business,\r\nbut who was fairly and decently honourable in his money transactions.\r\nIn fact, he stood well on \'Change.\r\n\r\nAnd during these two years he had stood a contest for a seat in\r\nParliament, having striven to represent the metropolitan borough of\r\nChelsea, on the extremely Radical interest. It is true that he had\r\nfailed, and that he had spent a considerable sum of money in the\r\ncontest. "Where on earth does your nephew get his money?" men said to\r\nJohn Vavasor at his club. "Upon my word I don\'t know," said Vavasor.\r\n"He doesn\'t get it from me, and I\'m sure he doesn\'t get it from my\r\nfather." But George Vavasor, though he failed at Chelsea, did not\r\nspend his money altogether fruitlessly. He gained reputation by the\r\nstruggle, and men came to speak of him as though he were one who\r\nwould do something. He was a stockbroker, a thorough-going Radical,\r\nand yet he was the heir to a fine estate, which had come down from\r\nfather to son for four hundred years! There was something captivating\r\nabout his history and adventures, especially as just at the time of\r\nthe election he became engaged to an heiress, who died a month before\r\nthe marriage should have taken place. She died without a will, and\r\nher money all went to some third cousins.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor bore this last disappointment like a man, and it was\r\nat this time that he again became fully reconciled to his cousin.\r\nPrevious to this they had met; and Alice, at her cousin Kate\'s\r\ninstigation, had induced her father to meet him. But at first there\r\nhad been no renewal of real friendship. Alice had given her cordial\r\nassent to her cousin\'s marriage with the heiress, Miss Grant, telling\r\nKate that such an engagement was the very thing to put him thoroughly\r\non his feet. And then she had been much pleased by his spirit at that\r\nChelsea election. "It was grand of him, wasn\'t it?" said Kate, her\r\neyes brimming full of tears. "It was very spirited," said Alice. "If\r\nyou knew all, you would say so. They could get no one else to stand\r\nbut that Mr. Travers, and he wouldn\'t come forward, unless they would\r\nguarantee all his expenses." "I hope it didn\'t cost George much,"\r\nsaid Alice. "It did, though; nearly all he had got. But what matters?\r\nMoney\'s nothing to him, except for its uses. My own little mite is\r\nmy own now, and he shall have every farthing of it for the next\r\nelection, even though I should go out as a housemaid the next day."\r\nThere must have been something great about George Vavasor, or he\r\nwould not have been so idolized by such a girl as his sister Kate.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present spring, before the arrangements for the Swiss\r\njourney were made, George Vavasor had spoken to Alice about that\r\nintended marriage which had been broken off by the lady\'s death. He\r\nwas sitting one evening with his cousin in the drawing-room in Queen\r\nAnne Street, waiting for Kate, who was to join him there before going\r\nto some party. I wonder whether Kate had had a hint from her brother\r\nto be late! At any rate, the two were together for an hour, and the\r\ntalk had been all about himself. He had congratulated her on her\r\nengagement with Mr. Grey, which had just become known to him, and had\r\nthen spoken of his own last intended marriage.\r\n\r\n"I grieved for her," he said, "greatly."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you did, George."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did;--for her, herself. Of course the world has given me\r\ncredit for lamenting the loss of her money. But the truth is, that as\r\nregards both herself and her money, it is much better for me that we\r\nwere never married."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean even though she should have lived?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--even had she lived."\r\n\r\n"And why so? If you liked her, her money was surely no drawback."\r\n\r\n"No; not if I had liked her."\r\n\r\n"And did you not like her?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"I did not love her as a man should love his wife, if you mean that.\r\nAs for my liking her, I did like her. I liked her very much."\r\n\r\n"But you would have loved her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t find that task of loving so very easy. It\r\nmight have been that I should have learned to hate her."\r\n\r\n"If so, it is better for you, and better for her, that she has gone."\r\n\r\n"It is better. I am sure of it. And yet I grieve for her, and in\r\nthinking of her I almost feel as though I were guilty of her death."\r\n\r\n"But she never suspected that you did not love her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. But she was not given to think much of such things. She took\r\nall that for granted. Poor girl! she is at rest now, and her money\r\nhas gone, where it should go, among her own relatives."\r\n\r\n"Yes; with such feelings as yours are about her, her money would have\r\nbeen a burden to you."\r\n\r\n"I would not have taken it. I hope, at least, that I would not have\r\ntaken it. Money is a sore temptation, especially to a poor man like\r\nme. It is well for me that the trial did not come in my way."\r\n\r\n"But you are not such a very poor man now, are you, George? I thought\r\nyour business was a good one."\r\n\r\n"It is, and I have no right to be a poor man. But a man will be poor\r\nwho does such mad things as I do. I had three or four thousand pounds\r\nclear, and I spent every shilling of it on the Chelsea election.\r\nGoodness knows whether I shall have a shilling at all when another\r\nchance comes round; but if I have I shall certainly spend it, and\r\nif I have not, I shall go in debt wherever I can raise a hundred\r\npounds."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will be successful at last."\r\n\r\n"I feel sure that I shall. But, in the mean time, I cannot but know\r\nthat my career is perfectly reckless. No woman ought to join her lot\r\nto mine unless she has within her courage to be as reckless as I am.\r\nYou know what men do when they toss up for shillings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose I do."\r\n\r\n"I am tossing up every day of my life for every shilling that I\r\nhave."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you\'re--gambling?"\r\n\r\n"No. I have given that up altogether. I used to gamble, but I never\r\ndo that now, and never shall again. What I mean is this,--that I hold\r\nmyself in readiness to risk everything at any moment, in order to\r\ngain any object that may serve my turn. I am always ready to lead a\r\nforlorn hope. That\'s what I mean by tossing up every day for every\r\nshilling that I have."\r\n\r\nAlice did not quite understand him, and perhaps he did not intend\r\nthat she should. Perhaps his object was to mystify her imagination.\r\nShe did not understand him, but I fear that she admired the kind of\r\ncourage which he professed. And he had not only professed it: in that\r\nmatter of the past election he had certainly practised it.\r\n\r\nIn talking of beauty to his sister he had spoken of himself as being\r\nugly. He would not generally have been called ugly by women, had not\r\none side of his face been dreadfully scarred by a cicatrice, which in\r\nhealing, had left a dark indented line down from his left eye to his\r\nlower jaw. That black ravine running through his cheek was certainly\r\nugly. On some occasions, when he was angry or disappointed, it was\r\nvery hideous; for he would so contort his face that the scar would,\r\nas it were, stretch itself out, revealing all its horrors, and his\r\ncountenance would become all scar. "He looked at me like the devil\r\nhimself--making the hole in his face gape at me," the old squire\r\nhad said to John Vavasor in describing the interview in which the\r\ngrandson had tried to bully his grandfather into assenting to his own\r\nviews about the mortgage. But in other respects George\'s face was not\r\nugly, and might have been thought handsome by many women. His hair\r\nwas black, and was parted in the front. His forehead, though low,\r\nwas broad. His eyes were dark and bright, and his eyebrows were very\r\nfull, and perfectly black. At those periods of his anger, all his\r\nface which was not scar, was eye and eyebrow. He wore a thick black\r\nmoustache, which covered his mouth, but no whiskers. People said of\r\nhim that he was so proud of his wound that he would not grow a hair\r\nto cover it. The fact, however, was that no whisker could be made to\r\ncome sufficiently forward to be of service, and therefore he wore\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe story of that wound should be told. When he was yet hardly more\r\nthan a boy, before he had come up to London, he was living in a\r\nhouse in the country which his father then occupied. At the time\r\nhis father was absent, and he and his sister only were in the house\r\nwith the maid-servants. His sister had a few jewels in her room, and\r\nan exaggerated report of them having come to the ears of certain\r\nenterprising burglars, a little plan was arranged for obtaining them.\r\nA small boy was hidden in the house, a window was opened, and at the\r\nproper witching hour of night a stout individual crept up-stairs in\r\nhis stocking-feet, and was already at Kate Vavasor\'s door,--when,\r\nin the dark, dressed only in his nightshirt, wholly unarmed, George\r\nVavasor flew at the fellow\'s throat. Two hours elapsed before the\r\nhorror-stricken women of the house could bring men to the place.\r\nGeorge\'s face had then been ripped open from the eye downwards, with\r\nsome chisel, or house-breaking instrument. But the man was dead.\r\nGeorge had wrenched from him his own tool, and having first jabbed\r\nhim all over with insufficient wounds, had at last driven the steel\r\nthrough his windpipe. The small boy escaped, carrying with him two\r\nshillings and threepence which Kate had left upon the drawing-room\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor was rather low in stature, but well made, with small\r\nhands and feet, but broad in the chest and strong in the loins. He\r\nwas a fine horseman and a hard rider; and men who had known him well\r\nsaid that he could fence and shoot with a pistol as few men care to\r\ndo in these peaceable days. Since volunteering had come up, he had\r\nbecome a captain of Volunteers, and had won prizes with his rifle at\r\nWimbledon.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the life of George Vavasor, and such was his character,\r\nand such his appearance. He had always lived alone in London, and did\r\nso at present; but just now his sister was much with him, as she was\r\nstaying up in town with an aunt, another Vavasor by birth, with whom\r\nthe reader will, if he persevere, become acquainted in course of\r\ntime. I hope he will persevere a little, for of all the Vavasors Mrs.\r\nGreenow was perhaps the best worth knowing. But Kate Vavasor\'s home\r\nwas understood to be in her grandfather\'s house in Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before they started for Switzerland, George and Kate\r\nwalked from Queen Anne Street, where they had been dining with Alice,\r\nto Mrs. Greenow\'s house. Everything had been settled about luggage,\r\nhours of starting, and routes as regarded their few first days;\r\nand the common purse had been made over to George. That portion of\r\nMr. Grey\'s letter had been read which alluded to the Paynims and\r\nthe glasses of water, and everything had passed in the best of\r\ngood-humour. "I\'ll endeavour to get the cold water for you," George\r\nhad said; "but as to the breakfasts, I can only hope you won\'t put\r\nme to severe trials by any very early hours. When people go out for\r\npleasure it should be pleasure."\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister walked through two or three streets in\r\nsilence, and then Kate asked a question.\r\n\r\n"George, I wonder what your wishes really are about Alice?"\r\n\r\n"That she shouldn\'t want her breakfast too early while we are away."\r\n\r\n"That means that I\'m to hold my tongue, of course."\r\n\r\n"No, it doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then it means that you intend to hold yours."\r\n\r\n"No; not that either."\r\n\r\n"Then what does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"That I have no fixed wishes on the subject. Of course she\'ll marry\r\nthis man John Grey, and then no one will hear another word about\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"She will no doubt, if you don\'t interfere. Probably she will whether\r\nyou interfere or not. But if you wish to interfere--"\r\n\r\n"She\'s got four hundred a year, and is not so good-looking as she\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"Yes; she has got four hundred a year, and she is more handsome now\r\nthan ever she was. I know that you think so;--and that you love her\r\nand love no one else--unless you have a sneaking fondness for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave you to judge of that last."\r\n\r\n"And as for me,--I only love two people in the world; her and you. If\r\never you mean to try, you should try now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe Balcony at Basle.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not going to describe the Vavasors\' Swiss tour. It would not be\r\nfair on my readers. "Six Weeks in the Bernese Oberland, by party of\r\nthree," would have but very small chance of success in the literary\r\nworld at present, and I should consider myself to be dishonest if\r\nI attempt to palm off such matter on the public in the pages of a\r\nnovel. It is true that I have just returned from Switzerland, and\r\nshould find such a course of writing very convenient. But I dismiss\r\nthe temptation, strong as it is. _Retro age, Satanas._ No living man\r\nor woman any longer wants to be told anything of the Grimsell or\r\nof the Gemmi. Ludgate Hill is now-a-days more interesting than the\r\nJungfrau.\r\n\r\nThe Vavasors were not very energetic on their tour. As George had\r\nsaid, they had gone out for pleasure and not for work. They went\r\ndirect to Interlaken and then hung about between that place and\r\nGrindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, It delighted him to sit still on some\r\nouter bench, looking at the mountains, with a cigar in his mouth,\r\nand it seemed to delight them to be with him. Much that Mr. Grey\r\nprophesied had come true. The two girls were ministers to him,\r\ninstead of having him as their slave.\r\n\r\n"What fine fellows those Alpine club men think themselves," he said\r\non one of these occasions, "and how thoroughly they despise the sort\r\nof enjoyment I get from mountains. But they\'re mistaken."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why either need be mistaken," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But they are mistaken," he continued. "They rob the mountains of\r\ntheir poetry, which is or should be their greatest charm. Mont Blanc\r\ncan have no mystery for a man who has been up it half a dozen times.\r\nIt\'s like getting behind the scenes at a ballet, or making a conjuror\r\nexplain his tricks."\r\n\r\n"But is the exercise nothing?" said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Yes; the exercise is very fine;--but that avoids the question."\r\n\r\n"And they all botanize," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it. I believe that the most of them simply walk\r\nup the mountain and down again. But if they did, that avoids the\r\nquestion also. The poetry and mystery of the mountains are lost to\r\nthose who make themselves familiar with their details, not the less\r\nbecause such familiarity may have useful results. In this world\r\nthings are beautiful only because they are not quite seen, or not\r\nperfectly understood. Poetry is precious chiefly because it suggests\r\nmore than it declares. Look in there, through that valley, where you\r\njust see the distant little peak at the end. Are you not dreaming\r\nof the unknown beautiful world that exists up there;--beautiful, as\r\nheaven is beautiful, because you know nothing of the reality? If you\r\nmake your way up there and back to-morrow, and find out all about it,\r\ndo you mean to say that it will be as beautiful to you when you come\r\nback?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I think it would," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve no poetry in you. Now I\'m made up of poetry." After that\r\nthey began to laugh at him and were very happy.\r\n\r\nI think that Mr. Grey was right in answering Alice\'s letter as he did;\r\nbut I think that Lady Macleod was also right in saying that Alice\r\nshould not have gone to Switzerland in company with George Vavasor. A\r\npeculiar familiarity sprang up, which, had all its circumstances been\r\nknown to Mr. Grey, would not have entirely satisfied him, even though\r\nno word was said which might in itself have displeased him. During\r\nthe first weeks of their travelling no word was said which would\r\nhave displeased him; but at last, when the time for their return was\r\ndrawing nigh, when their happiness was nearly over, and that feeling\r\nof melancholy was coming on them which always pervades the last hours\r\nof any period that has been pleasant,--then words became softer than\r\nthey had been, and references were made to old days,--allusions which\r\nnever should have been permitted between them.\r\n\r\nAlice had been very happy,--more happy perhaps in that she had been\r\na joint minister with Kate to her cousin George\'s idle fantasies,\r\nthan she would have been hurrying about with him as her slave. They\r\nhad tacitly agreed to spoil him with comforts; and girls are always\r\nhappier in spoiling some man than in being spoiled by men. And he had\r\ntaken it all well, doing his despotism pleasantly, exacting much,\r\nbut exacting nothing that was disagreeable. And he had been amusing\r\nalways, as Alice thought without any effort. But men and women, when\r\nthey show themselves at their best, seldom do so without an effort.\r\nIf the object be near the heart the effort will be pleasant to him\r\nwho makes it, and if it be made well, it will be hidden; but, not the\r\nless, will the effort be there. George Vavasor had on the present\r\noccasion done his very best to please his cousin.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting at Basle one evening in the balcony of the big\r\nhotel which overlooks the Rhine. The balcony runs the length of the\r\nhouse, and is open to all the company; but it is spacious, and little\r\nparties can be formed there with perfect privacy. The swift broad\r\nRhine runs underneath, rushing through from the bridge which here\r\nspans the river; and every now and then on summer evenings loud\r\nshouts come up from strong swimmers in the water, who are glorying\r\nin the swiftness of the current. The three were sitting there, by\r\nthemselves, at the end of the balcony. Coffee was before them on a\r\nlittle table, and George\'s cigar, as usual, was in his mouth.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nearly all over," said he, after they had remained silent for\r\nsome minutes.\r\n\r\n"And I do think it has been a success," said Kate. "Always excepting\r\nabout the money. I\'m ruined for ever."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make your money all straight," said George.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you\'ll do nothing of the kind," said Kate. "I\'m ruined, but\r\nyou are ruineder. But what signifies? It is such a great thing ever\r\nto have had six weeks\' happiness, that the ruin is, in point of fact,\r\na good speculation. What do you say, Alice? Won\'t you vote, too, that\r\nwe\'ve done it well?"\r\n\r\n"I think we\'ve done it very well. I have enjoyed myself thoroughly."\r\n\r\n"And now you\'ve got to go home to John Grey and Cambridgeshire! It\'s\r\nno wonder you should be melancholy." That was the thought in Kate\'s\r\nmind, but she did not speak it out on this occasion.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good of you, Alice," said Kate. "Is it not, George? I like a\r\nperson who will give a hearty meed of approbation."\r\n\r\n"But I am giving the meed of approbation to myself."\r\n\r\n"I like a person even to do that heartily," said Kate. "Not that\r\nGeorge and I are thankful for the compliment. We are prepared to\r\nadmit that we owe almost everything to you,--are we not, George?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not; by any means," said George.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am, and I expect to have something pretty said to me in\r\nreturn. Have I been cross once, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think you have. You are never cross, though you are\r\noften ferocious."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t been once ferocious,--nor has George."\r\n\r\n"He would have been the most ungrateful man alive if he had," said\r\nAlice. "We\'ve done nothing since we\'ve started but realize from him\r\nthat picture in \'Punch\' of the young gentleman at Jeddo who had a\r\ndozen ladies to wait upon him."\r\n\r\n"And now he has got to go home to his lodgings, and wait upon himself\r\nagain. Poor fellow! I do pity you, George."\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t;--nor does Alice. I believe girls always think that\r\na bachelor in London has the happiest of all lives. It\'s because\r\nthey think so that they generally want to put an end to the man\'s\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"It\'s envy that makes us want to get married,--not love," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the devil in some shape, as often as not," said he. "With a\r\nman, marriage always seems to him to be an evil at the instant."\r\n\r\n"Not always," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Almost always;--but he does it, as he takes physic, because\r\nsomething worse will come if he don\'t. A man never likes having his\r\ntooth pulled out, but all men do have their teeth pulled out,--and\r\nthey who delay it too long suffer the very mischief."\r\n\r\n"I do like George\'s philosophy," said Kate, getting up from her chair\r\nas she spoke; "it is so sharp, and has such a pleasant acid taste\r\nabout it; and then we all know that it means nothing. Alice, I\'m\r\ngoing up-stairs to begin the final packing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you, dear."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t. To tell the truth I\'m only going into that man\'s room\r\nbecause he won\'t put up a single thing of his own decently. We\'ll\r\ndo ours, of course, when we go up to bed. Whatever you disarrange\r\nto-night, Master George, you must rearrange for yourself to-morrow\r\nmorning, for I promise I won\'t go into your room at five o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"How I do hate that early work," said George.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be down again very soon," said Kate. "Then we\'ll take one turn\r\non the bridge and go to bed."\r\n\r\nAlice and George were left together sitting in the balcony. They\r\nhad been alone together before many times since their travels had\r\ncommenced; but they both of them felt that there was something to\r\nthem in the present moment different from any other period of their\r\njourney. There was something that each felt to be sweet, undefinable,\r\nand dangerous. Alice had known that it would be better for her to go\r\nup-stairs with Kate; but Kate\'s answer had been of such a nature that\r\nhad she gone she would have shown that she had some special reason\r\nfor going. Why should she show such a need? Or why, indeed, should\r\nshe entertain it?\r\n\r\nAlice was seated quite at the end of the gallery, and Kate\'s chair\r\nwas at her feet in the corner. When Alice and Kate had seated\r\nthemselves, the waiter had brought a small table for the coffee-cups,\r\nand George had placed his chair on the other side of that. So that\r\nAlice was, as it were, a prisoner. She could not slip away without\r\nsome special preparation for going, and Kate had so placed her chair\r\nin leaving, that she must actually have asked George to move it\r\nbefore she could escape. But why should she wish to escape? Nothing\r\ncould be more lovely and enticing than the scene before her. The\r\nnight had come on, with quick but still unperceived approach, as it\r\ndoes in those parts; for the twilight there is not prolonged as it is\r\nwith us more northern folk. The night had come on, but there was a\r\nrising moon, which just sufficed to give a sheen to the water beneath\r\nher. The air was deliciously soft;--of that softness which produces\r\nno sensation either of warmth or cold, but which just seems to touch\r\none with loving tenderness, as though the unseen spirits of the air\r\nkissed one\'s forehead as they passed on their wings. The Rhine was\r\nrunning at her feet, so near, that in the soft half light it seemed\r\nas though she might step into its ripple. The Rhine was running\r\nby with that delicious sound of rapidly moving waters, that fresh\r\nrefreshing gurgle of the river, which is so delicious to the ear at\r\nall times. If you be talking, it wraps up your speech, keeping it for\r\nyourselves, making it difficult neither to her who listens nor to him\r\nwho speaks. If you would sleep, it is of all lullabies the sweetest.\r\nIf you are alone and would think, it aids all your thoughts. If\r\nyou are alone, and, alas! would not think,--if thinking be too\r\npainful,--it will dispel your sorrow, and give the comfort which\r\nmusic alone can give. Alice felt that the air kissed her, that\r\nthe river sang for her its sweetest song, that the moon shone for\r\nher with its softest light,--that light which lends the poetry of\r\nhalf-developed beauty to everything that it touches. Why should she\r\nleave it?\r\n\r\nNothing was said for some minutes after Kate\'s departure, and Alice\r\nwas beginning to shake from her that half feeling of danger which had\r\ncome over her. Vavasor had sat back in his chair, leaning against\r\nthe house, with his feet raised upon a stool; his arms were folded\r\nacross his breast, and he seemed to have divided himself between\r\nhis thoughts and his cigar. Alice was looking full upon the river,\r\nand her thoughts had strayed away to her future home among John\r\nGrey\'s flower-beds and shrubs; but the river, though it sang to her\r\npleasantly, seemed to sing a song of other things than such a home as\r\nthat,--a song full of mystery, as are all river songs when one tries\r\nto understand their words.\r\n\r\n"When are you to be married, Alice?" said George at last.\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!" said she. "You ask me a question as though you were\r\nputting a pistol to my ear."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry the question was so unpleasant."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say that it was unpleasant; but you asked it so suddenly!\r\nThe truth is, I didn\'t expect you to speak at all just then. I\r\nsuppose I was thinking of something."\r\n\r\n"But if it be not unpleasant,--when are you to be married?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. It is not fixed."\r\n\r\n"But about when, I mean? This summer?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not this summer, for the summer will be over when we reach\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"This winter? Next spring? Next year?--or in ten years\' time?"\r\n\r\n"Before the expiration of the ten years, I suppose. Anything more\r\nexact than that I can\'t say."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you like it?" he then said.\r\n\r\n"What, being married? You see I\'ve never tried yet."\r\n\r\n"The idea of it,--the anticipation, You look forward with\r\nsatisfaction to the kind of life you will lead at Nethercoats? Don\'t\r\nsuppose I am saying anything against it, for I have no conception\r\nwhat sort of a place Nethercoats is. On the whole I don\'t know that\r\nthere is any kind of life better than that of an English country\r\ngentleman in his own place;--that is, if he can keep it up, and not\r\nlive as the old squire does, in a state of chronic poverty."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Grey\'s place doesn\'t entitle him to be called a country\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"But you like the prospect of it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, George, how you do cross-question one! Of course I like it, or\r\nI shouldn\'t have accepted it."\r\n\r\n"That does not follow. But I quite acknowledge that I have no right\r\nto cross-question you. If I ever had such right on the score of\r\ncousinship, I have lost it on the score of--; but we won\'t mind that,\r\nwill we, Alice?" To this she at first made no answer, but he repeated\r\nthe question. "Will we, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Will we what?"\r\n\r\n"Recur to the old days."\r\n\r\n"Why should we recur to them? They are passed, and as we are again\r\nfriends and dear cousins the sting of them is gone."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! The sting of them is gone. It is for that reason, because\r\nit is so, that we may at last recur to them without danger. If we\r\nregret nothing,--if neither of us has anything to regret, why not\r\nrecur to them, and talk of them freely?"\r\n\r\n"No, George; that would not do."\r\n\r\n"By heavens, no! It would drive me mad; and if I know aught of you,\r\nit would hardly leave you as calm as you are at present."\r\n\r\n"As I would wish to be left calm--"\r\n\r\n"Would you? Then I suppose I ought to hold my tongue. But, Alice, I\r\nshall never have the power of speaking to you again as I speak now.\r\nSince we have been out together, we have been dear friends; is it not\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"And shall we not always be dear friends?"\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not. How will it be possible? Think of it. How can I\r\nreally be your friend when you are the mistress of that man\'s house\r\nin Cambridgeshire?"\r\n\r\n"George!"\r\n\r\n"I mean nothing disrespectful. I truly beg your pardon if it\r\nhas seemed so. Let me say that gentleman\'s house;--for he is a\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"That he certainly is."\r\n\r\n"You could not have accepted him were he not so. But how can I be\r\nyour friend when you are his wife? I may still call you cousin Alice,\r\nand pat your children on the head if I chance to see them; and shall\r\nstop in the streets and shake hands with him if I meet him;--that is\r\nif my untoward fate does not induce him to cut my acquaintance;--but\r\nas for friendship, that will be over when you and I shall have parted\r\nnext Thursday evening at London Bridge."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George, don\'t say so!"\r\n\r\n"But I do."\r\n\r\n"And why on Thursday? Do you mean that you won\'t come to Queen Anne\r\nStreet any more?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is what I do mean. This trip of ours has been very\r\nsuccessful, Kate says. Perhaps Kate knows nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"It has been very pleasant,--at least to me."\r\n\r\n"And the pleasure has had no drawback?"\r\n\r\n"None to me."\r\n\r\n"It has been very pleasant to me, also;--but the pleasure has had its\r\nalloy. Alice, I have nothing to ask from you,--nothing."\r\n\r\n"Anything that you should ask, I would do for you."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to ask;--nothing. But I have one word to say."\r\n\r\n"George, do not say it. Let me go up-stairs. Let me go to Kate."\r\n\r\n"Certainly; if you wish it you shall go." He still held his foot\r\nagainst the chair which barred her passage, and did not attempt to\r\nrise as he must have done to make way for her passage out. "Certainly\r\nyou shall go to Kate, if you refuse to hear me. But after all\r\nthat has passed between us, after these six weeks of intimate\r\ncompanionship, I think you ought to listen to me. I tell you that I\r\nhave nothing to ask. I am not going to make love to you."\r\n\r\nAlice had commenced some attempt to rise, but she had again settled\r\nherself in her chair. And now, when he paused for a moment, she made\r\nno further sign that she wished to escape, nor did she say a word to\r\nintimate her further wish that he should be silent.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to make love to you," he said again. "As for making\r\nlove, as the word goes, that must be over between you and me. It has\r\nbeen made and marred, and cannot be remade. It may exist, or it may\r\nhave been expelled; but where it does not exist, it will never be\r\nbrought back again."\r\n\r\n"It should not be spoken of between you and me."\r\n\r\n"So, no doubt, any proper-going duenna would say, and so, too, little\r\nchildren should be told; but between you and me there can be no\r\nnecessity for falsehood. We have grown beyond our sugar-toothed ages,\r\nand are now men and women. I perfectly understood your breaking away\r\nfrom me. I understood you, and in spite of my sorrow knew that you\r\nwere right. I am not going to accuse or to defend myself; but I knew\r\nthat you were right."\r\n\r\n"Then let there be no more about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes; there must be more about it. I did not understand you when you\r\naccepted Mr. Grey. Against him I have not a whisper to make. He may\r\nbe perfect for aught I know. But, knowing you as I thought I did, I\r\ncould not understand your loving such a man as him. It was as though\r\none who had lived on brandy should take himself suddenly to a milk\r\ndiet,--and enjoy the change! A milk diet is no doubt the best. But\r\nmen who have lived on brandy can\'t make those changes very suddenly.\r\nThey perish in the attempt."\r\n\r\n"Not always, George."\r\n\r\n"It may be done with months of agony;--but there was no such agony\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"Who can tell?"\r\n\r\n"But you will tell me the cure was made. I thought so, and therefore\r\nthought that I should find you changed. I thought that you, who had\r\nbeen all fire, would now have turned yourself into soft-flowing milk\r\nand honey, and have become fit for the life in store for you. With\r\nsuch a one I might have travelled from Moscow to Malta without\r\ndanger. The woman fit to be John Grey\'s wife would certainly do\r\nme no harm,--could not touch my happiness. I might have loved her\r\nonce,--might still love the memory of what she had been; but her, in\r\nher new form, after her new birth,--such a one as that, Alice, could\r\nbe nothing to me. Don\'t mistake me. I have enough of wisdom in me to\r\nknow how much better, ay, and happier a woman she might be. It was\r\nnot that I thought you had descended in the scale; but I gave you\r\ncredit for virtues which you have not acquired. Alice, that wholesome\r\ndiet of which I spoke is not your diet. You would starve on it, and\r\nperish."\r\n\r\nHe had spoken with great energy, but still in a low voice, having\r\nturned full round upon the table, with both his arms upon it, and his\r\nface stretched out far over towards her. She was looking full at him;\r\nand, as I have said before, that scar and his gloomy eyes and thick\r\neyebrows seemed to make up the whole of his face. But the scar had\r\nnever been ugly to her. She knew the story, and when he was her lover\r\nshe had taken pride in the mark of the wound. She looked at him, but\r\nthough he paused she did not speak. The music of the river was still\r\nin her ears, and there came upon her a struggle as though she were\r\nstriving to understand its song. Were the waters also telling her of\r\nthe mistake she had made in accepting Mr. Grey as her husband? What\r\nher cousin was now telling her,--was it not a repetition of words\r\nwhich she had spoken to herself hundreds of times during the last\r\ntwo months? Was she not telling herself daily,--hourly,--always,--in\r\nevery thought of her life, that in accepting Mr. Grey she had assumed\r\nherself to be mistress of virtues which she did not possess? Had\r\nshe not, in truth, rioted upon brandy, till the innocence of milk\r\nwas unfitted for her? This man now came and rudely told her all\r\nthis,--but did he not tell her the truth? She sat silent and\r\nconvicted; only gazing into his face when his speech was done.\r\n\r\n"I have learned this since we have been again together, Alice; and\r\nfinding you, not the angel I had supposed, finding you to be the same\r\nwoman I had once loved,--the safety that I anticipated has not fallen\r\nto my lot. That\'s all. Here\'s Kate, and now we\'ll go for our walk."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Bridge over the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n"George," said Kate, speaking before she quite got up to them, "will\r\nyou tell me whether you have been preparing all your things for an\r\nopen sale by auction?" Then she stole a look at Alice, and having\r\nlearned from that glance that something had occurred which prevented\r\nAlice from joining her in her raillery, she went on with it herself\r\nrapidly, as though to cover Alice\'s confusion, and give her time to\r\nrally before they should all move. "Would you believe it? he had\r\nthree razors laid out on his table--"\r\n\r\n"A man must shave,--even at Basle."\r\n\r\n"But not with three razors at once; and three hair-brushes, and\r\nhalf a dozen toothbrushes, and a small collection of combs, and\r\nfour or five little glass bottles, looking as though they contained\r\npoison,--all with silver tops. I can only suppose you desired to\r\nstartle the weak mind of the chambermaid. I have put them all up; but\r\nremember this, if they are taken out again you are responsible. And\r\nI will not put up your boots, George. What can you have wanted with\r\nthree pairs of boots at Basle?"\r\n\r\n"When you have completed the list of my wardrobe we\'ll go out upon\r\nthe bridge. That is, if Alice likes it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I shall like it."\r\n\r\n"Come along then," said Kate. And so they moved away. When they got\r\nupon the bridge Alice and Kate were together, while George strolled\r\nbehind them, close to them, but not taking any part in their\r\nconversation,--as though he had merely gone with them as an escort.\r\nKate seemed to be perfectly content with this arrangement, chattering\r\nto Alice, so that she might show that there was nothing serious on\r\nthe minds of any of them. It need hardly be said that Alice at this\r\ntime made no appeal to George to join them. He followed them at their\r\nheels, with his hands behind his back, looking down upon the pavement\r\nand simply waiting upon their pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said Kate, "I have a very great mind to run away."\r\n\r\n"Where do you want to run to?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--that wouldn\'t much signify. Perhaps I\'d go to the little inn\r\nat Handek. It\'s a lonely place, where nobody would hear of me,--and I\r\nshould have the waterfall. I\'m afraid they\'d want to have their bill\r\npaid. That would be the worst of it."\r\n\r\n"But why run away just now?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t, because you wouldn\'t like going home with George\r\nalone,--and I suppose he\'d be bound to look after me, as he\'s doing\r\nnow. I wonder what he thinks of having to walk over the bridge after\r\nus girls. I suppose he\'d be in that place down there drinking beer,\r\nif we weren\'t here."\r\n\r\n"If he wanted to go, I dare say he would, in spite of us."\r\n\r\n"That\'s ungrateful of you, for I\'m sure we\'ve never been kept in a\r\nmoment by his failing us. But as I was saying, I do dread going home.\r\nYou are going to John Grey, which may be pleasant enough; but I\'m\r\ngoing--to Aunt Greenow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your own choice."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not. I haven\'t any choice in the matter. Of course I might\r\nrefuse to speak to Aunt Greenow, and nobody could make me;--but\r\npractically I haven\'t any choice in the matter. Fancy a month at\r\nYarmouth with no companion but such a woman as that!"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t mind it. Aunt Greenow always seems to me to be a very\r\ngood sort of woman."\r\n\r\n"She may be a good woman, but I must say I think she\'s of a bad sort.\r\nYou\'ve never heard her talk about her husband?"\r\n\r\n"No, never; I think she did cry a little the first day she came to\r\nQueen Anne Street, but that wasn\'t unnatural."\r\n\r\n"He was thirty years older than herself."\r\n\r\n"But still he was her husband. And even if her tears are assumed,\r\nwhat of that? What\'s a woman to do? Of course she was wrong to marry\r\nhim. She was thirty-five, and had nothing, while he was sixty-five,\r\nand was very rich. According to all accounts she made him a very good\r\nwife, and now that she\'s got all his money, you wouldn\'t have her go\r\nabout laughing within three months of his death."\r\n\r\n"No; I wouldn\'t have her laugh; but neither would I have her cry.\r\nAnd she\'s quite right to wear weeds; but she needn\'t be so very\r\noutrageous in the depth of her hems, or so very careful that her caps\r\nare becoming. Her eyes will be worn out by their double service. They\r\nare always red with weeping, and yet she is ready every minute with a\r\nfull battery of execution for any man that she sees."\r\n\r\n"Then why have you consented to go to Yarmouth with her?"\r\n\r\n"Just because she\'s got forty thousand pounds. If Mr. Greenow had left\r\nher with a bare maintenance I don\'t suppose I should ever have held\r\nout my hand to her."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re as bad as she is."\r\n\r\n"Quite as bad;--and that\'s what makes me want to run away. But it\r\nisn\'t my own fault altogether. It\'s the fault of the world at large.\r\nDoes anybody ever drop their rich relatives? When she proposed to\r\ntake me to Yarmouth, wasn\'t it natural that the squire should ask me\r\nto go? When I told George, wasn\'t it natural that he should say, \'Oh,\r\ngo by all means. She\'s got forty thousand pounds!\' One can\'t pretend\r\nto be wiser or better than one\'s relatives. And after all what can I\r\nexpect from her money?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, I should say."\r\n\r\n"Not a halfpenny. I\'m nearly thirty and she\'s only forty, and of\r\ncourse she\'ll marry again. I will say of myself, too, that no person\r\nliving cares less for money."\r\n\r\n"I should think no one."\r\n\r\n"Yet one sticks to one\'s rich relatives. It\'s the way of the world."\r\nThen she paused a moment. "But shall I tell you, Alice, why I do\r\nstick to her? Perhaps you\'ll think the object as mean as though I\r\nwanted her money myself."\r\n\r\n"Why is it?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is on the cards that she may help George in his career. I\r\ndo not want money, but he may. And for such purposes as his, I think\r\nit fair that all the family should contribute. I feel sure that he\r\nwould make a name for himself in Parliament; and if I had my way I\r\nwould spend every shilling of Vavasor money in putting him there.\r\nWhen I told the squire so I thought he would have eaten me. I really\r\ndid think he would have turned me out of the house."\r\n\r\n"And serve you right too after what had happened."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t care. Let him turn me out. I was determined he should know\r\nwhat I thought. He swore at me; and then he was so unhappy at what\r\nhe had done that he came and kissed me that night in my bedroom, and\r\ngave me a ten-pound note. What do you think I did with it? I sent it\r\nas a contribution to the next election and George has it now locked\r\nup in a box. Don\'t you tell him that I told you."\r\n\r\nThen they stopped and leaned for a while over the parapet of the\r\nbridge. "Come here, George," said Kate; and she made room for him\r\nbetween herself and Alice. "Wouldn\'t you like to be swimming down\r\nthere as those boys were doing when we went out into the balcony? The\r\nwater looks so enticing."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I should;--unless it might be a pleasant way of swimming\r\ninto the next world."\r\n\r\n"I should so like to feel myself going with the stream," said Kate;\r\n"particularly by this light. I can\'t fancy in the least that I should\r\nbe drowned."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t fancy anything else," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"It would be so pleasant to feel the water gliding along one\'s limbs,\r\nand to be carried away headlong,--knowing that you were on the direct\r\nroad to Rotterdam."\r\n\r\n"And so arrive there without your clothes," said George.\r\n\r\n"They would be brought after in a boat. Didn\'t you see that those\r\nboys had a boat with them? But if I lived here, I\'d never do it\r\nexcept by moonlight. The water looks so clear and bright now, and the\r\nrushing sound of it is so soft! The sea at Yarmouth won\'t be anything\r\nlike that I suppose."\r\n\r\nNeither of them any longer answered her, and yet she went on talking\r\nabout the river, and their aunt, and her prospects at Yarmouth.\r\nNeither of them answered her, and yet it seemed that they had not a\r\nword to say to each other. But still they stood there looking down\r\nupon the river, and every now and then Kate\'s voice was to be heard,\r\npreventing the feeling which might otherwise have arisen that their\r\nhearts were too full for speech.\r\n\r\nAt last Alice seemed to shiver. There was a slight trembling in her\r\narms, which George felt rather than saw. "You are cold," he said.\r\n\r\n"No indeed."\r\n\r\n"If you are let us go in. I thought you shivered with the night air."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t that. I was thinking of something. Don\'t you ever think of\r\nthings that make you shiver?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do, very often;--so often that I have to do my shiverings\r\ninwardly. Otherwise people would think I had the palsy."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean things of moment," said Alice. "Little bits of things\r\nmake me do it;--perhaps a word that I said and ought not to have said\r\nten years ago;--the most ordinary little mistakes, even my own past\r\nthoughts to myself about the merest trifles. They are always making\r\nme shiver."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not because you have committed any murder then."\r\n\r\n"No; but it\'s my conscience all the same, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'m not so good as you. I doubt it\'s not my conscience at all.\r\nWhen I think of a chance I\'ve let go by, as I have thousands, then it\r\nis that I shiver. But, as I tell you, I shiver inwardly. I\'ve been in\r\none long shiver ever since we came out because of one chance that I\r\nlet go by. Come, we\'ll go in. We\'ve to be up at five o\'clock, and now\r\nit\'s eleven. I\'ll do the rest of my shivering in bed."\r\n\r\n"Are you tired of being out?" said Kate, when the other two began to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n"Not tired of being out, but George reminds me that we have to be up\r\nat five."\r\n\r\n"I wish George would hold his tongue. We can\'t come to the bridge\r\nat Basle every night in our lives. If one found oneself at the top\r\nof Sinai I\'m afraid the first feeling would be one of fear lest one\r\nwouldn\'t be down in time to dress for dinner. Are you aware, George,\r\nthat the king of rivers is running beneath your feet, and that the\r\nmoon is shining with a brilliance you never see at home?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay here all night if you\'ll put off going to-morrow," said\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n"Our money wouldn\'t hold out," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about Sinai any more after that," said he, "but let\'s go\r\nin to bed."\r\n\r\nThey walked across the bridge back to the hotel in the same manner as\r\nbefore, the two girls going together with the young man after them,\r\nand so they went up the front steps of the hotel, through the hall,\r\nand on to the stairs. Here George handed Alice her candle, and as he\r\ndid so he whispered a few words to her. "My shivering fit has to come\r\nyet," said he, "and will last me the whole night." She would have\r\ngiven much to be able to answer him lightly, as though what he had\r\nsaid had meant nothing;--but she couldn\'t do it; the light speech\r\nwould not come to her. She was conscious of all this, and went away\r\nto her own room without answering him at all. Here she sat down at\r\nthe window looking out upon the river till Kate should join her.\r\nTheir rooms opened through from one to the other, and she would not\r\nbegin her packing till her cousin should come.\r\n\r\nBut Kate had gone with her brother, promising, as she did so, that\r\nshe would be back in half a minute. That half minute was protracted\r\nbeyond half an hour. "If you\'ll take my advice," said Kate, at last,\r\nstanding up with her candle in her hand, "you\'ll ask her in plain\r\nwords to give you another chance. Do it to-morrow at Strasbourg;\r\nyou\'ll never have a better opportunity."\r\n\r\n"And bid her throw John Grey over!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say anything about John Grey; leave her to settle that matter\r\nwith herself. Believe me that she has quite courage enough to dispose\r\nof John Grey, if she has courage enough to accept your offer."\r\n\r\n"Kate, you women never understand each other. If I were to do that,\r\nall her most powerful feelings would be arrayed in arms against me.\r\nI must leave her to find out first that she wishes to be rid of her\r\nengagement."\r\n\r\n"She has found that out long ago. Do you think I don\'t know what she\r\nwishes? But if you can\'t bring yourself to speak to her, she\'ll marry\r\nhim in spite of her wishes."\r\n\r\n"Bring myself! I\'ve never been very slow in bringing myself to speak\r\nto any one when there was need. It isn\'t very pleasant sometimes, but\r\nI do it, if I find occasion."\r\n\r\n"But surely it must be pleasant with her. You must be glad to find\r\nthat she still loves you. You still love her, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t provoke me, George. I\'m moving heaven and earth to bring you\r\ntwo together; but if I didn\'t think you loved her, I\'d go to her at\r\nonce and bid her never see you again."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Kate, I sometimes think it would be better if you\'d\r\nleave heaven and earth alone."\r\n\r\n"Then I will. But of all human beings, surely you\'re the most\r\nungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t she marry John Grey if she likes him?"\r\n\r\n"But she doesn\'t like him. And I hate him. I hate the sound of his\r\nvoice, and the turn of his eye, and that slow, steady movement of\r\nhis,--as though he was always bethinking himself that he wouldn\'t\r\nwear out his clothes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that your hating him ought to have anything to do with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going to preach morals, I\'ll leave you. It\'s the darling\r\nwish of my heart that she should be your wife. If you ever loved\r\nanybody,--and I sometimes doubt whether you ever did,--but if you\r\ndid, you loved her."\r\n\r\n"Did and do are different things."\r\n\r\n"Very well, George; then I have done. It has been the same in every\r\ntwist and turn of my life. In everything that I have striven to do\r\nfor you, you have thrown yourself over, in order that I might be\r\nthrown over too. But I believe you say this merely to vex me."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Kate, I think you\'d better go to bed."\r\n\r\n"But not till I\'ve told her everything. I won\'t leave her to be\r\ndeceived and ill-used again."\r\n\r\n"Who is ill-using her now? Is it not the worst of ill-usage, trying\r\nto separate her from that man?"\r\n\r\n"No;--if I thought so, I would have no hand in doing it. She would\r\nbe miserable with him, and make him miserable as well. She does not\r\nreally love him. He loves her, but I\'ve nothing to do with that. It\'s\r\nnothing to me if he breaks his heart."\r\n\r\n"I shall break mine if you don\'t let me go to bed."\r\n\r\nWith that she went away and hurried along the corridor, till she came\r\nto her cousin\'s room. She found Alice still seated at the window, or\r\nrather kneeling on the chair, with her head out through the lattice.\r\n"Why, you lazy creature," said Kate; "I declare you haven\'t touched a\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"You said we\'d do it together."\r\n\r\n"But he has kept me. Oh, what a man he is! If he ever does get\r\nmarried, what will his wife do with him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he ever will," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? I dare say you understand him better than I do. Sometimes\r\nI think that the only thing wanting to make him thoroughly good, is a\r\nwife. But it isn\'t every woman that would do for him. And the woman\r\nwho marries him should have high courage. There are moments with him\r\nwhen he is very wild; but he never is cruel and never hard. Is Mr.\r\nGrey ever hard?"\r\n\r\n"Never; nor yet wild."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly not that. I\'m quite sure he\'s never wild."\r\n\r\n"When you say that, Kate, I know that you mean to abuse him."\r\n\r\n"No; upon my word. What\'s the good of abusing him to you? I like a\r\nman to be wild,--wild in my sense. You knew that before."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether you\'d like a wild man for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s a question I\'ve never asked myself. I\'ve been often\r\ncurious to consider what sort of husband would suit you, but I\'ve\r\nhad very few thoughts about a husband for myself. The truth is, I\'m\r\nmarried to George. Ever since--"\r\n\r\n"Ever since what?"\r\n\r\n"Since you and he were parted, I\'ve had nothing to do in life but to\r\nstick to him. And I shall do so to the end,--unless one thing should\r\nhappen."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Unless you should become his wife after all. He will never marry\r\nanybody else."\r\n\r\n"Kate, you shouldn\'t allude to such a thing now. You know that it\'s\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps so. As far as I\'m concerned, it is all the better\r\nfor me. If George ever married, I should have nothing to do in the\r\nworld;--literally nothing--nothing--nothing--nothing!"\r\n\r\n"Kate, don\'t talk in that way," and Alice came up to her and embraced\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Go away," said she. "Go, Alice; you and I must part. I cannot bear\r\nit any longer. You must know it all. When you are married to John\r\nGrey, our friendship must be over. If you became George\'s wife I\r\nshould become nobody. I\'ve nothing else in the world. You and he\r\nwould be so all-sufficient for each other, that I should drop away\r\nfrom you like an old garment. But I\'d give up all, everything, every\r\nhope I have, to see you become George\'s wife. I know myself not to\r\nbe good. I know myself to be very bad, and yet I care nothing for\r\nmyself. Don\'t Alice, don\'t; I don\'t want your caresses. Caress him,\r\nand I\'ll kneel at your feet and cover them with kisses." She had now\r\nthrown herself upon a sofa, and had turned her face away to the wall.\r\n\r\n"Kate, you shouldn\'t speak in that way."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shouldn\'t,--but I do."\r\n\r\n"You, who know everything, must know that I cannot marry your\r\nbrother,--even if he wished it."\r\n\r\n"He does wish it."\r\n\r\n"Not though I were under no other engagement."\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Kate, again starting up. "What is there to\r\nseparate you from George now, but that unfortunate affair, that will\r\nend in the misery of you all. Do you think I can\'t see? Don\'t I know\r\nwhich of the two men you like best?"\r\n\r\n"You are making me sorry, Kate, that I have ventured to come here in\r\nyour brother\'s company. It is not only unkind of you to talk to me in\r\nthis way, but worse than that--it is indelicate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indelicate! How I do hate that word. If any word in the language\r\nreminds me of a whited sepulchre it is that;--all clean and polished\r\noutside with filth and rottenness within. Are your thoughts delicate?\r\nthat\'s the thing. You are engaged to marry John Grey. That may be\r\ndelicate enough if you love him truly, and feel yourself fitted to be\r\nhis wife; but it\'s about the most indelicate thing you can do, if you\r\nlove any one better than him. Delicacy with many women is like their\r\ncleanliness. Nothing can be nicer than the whole outside get-up, but\r\nyou wouldn\'t wish to answer for anything beneath."\r\n\r\n"If you think ill of me like that--"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think ill of you. How can I think ill of you when I know\r\nthat all your difficulties have come from him? It hasn\'t been your\r\nfault; it has been his throughout. It is he who has driven you to\r\nsacrifice yourself on this altar. If we can, both of us, manage to\r\nlay aside all delicacy and pretence, and dare to speak the truth,\r\nwe shall acknowledge that it is so. Had Mr. Grey come to you while\r\nthings were smooth between you and George, would you have thought it\r\npossible that he could be George\'s rival in your estimation? It is\r\nHyperion to Satyr."\r\n\r\n"And which is the Satyr?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave your heart to tell you. You know what is the darling\r\nwish of my heart. But, Alice, if I thought that Mr. Grey was to you\r\nHyperion,--if I thought that you could marry him with that sort of\r\nworshipping, idolatrous love which makes a girl proud as well as\r\nhappy in her marriage, I wouldn\'t raise a little finger to prevent\r\nit."\r\n\r\nTo this Alice made no answer, and then Kate allowed the matter to\r\ndrop. Alice made no answer, though she felt that she was allowing\r\njudgement to go against her by default in not doing so. She had\r\nintended to fight bravely, and to have maintained the excellence\r\nof her present position as the affianced bride of Mr. Grey, but she\r\nfelt that she had failed. She felt that she had, in some sort,\r\nacknowledged that the match was one to be deplored;--that her words\r\nin her own defence would by no means have satisfied Mr. Grey, if Mr.\r\nGrey could have heard them;--that they would have induced him to\r\noffer her back her troth rather than have made him happy as a lover.\r\nBut she had nothing further to say. She could do something. She would\r\nhurry home and bid him name the earliest day he pleased. After that\r\nher cousin would cease to disturb her in her career.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\'clock before the two girls began to prepare for\r\ntheir morning start, and Alice, when they had finished their packing,\r\nseemed to be worn out with fatigue. "If you are tired, dear, we\'ll\r\nput it off," said Kate. "Not for worlds," said Alice. "For half a\r\nword we\'ll do it," continued Kate. "I\'ll slip out to George and tell\r\nhim, and there\'s nothing he\'d like so much." But Alice would not\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nAbout two they got into bed, and punctually at six they were at the\r\nrailway station. "Don\'t speak to me," said George, when he met them\r\nat their door in the passage. "I shall only yawn in your face."\r\nHowever, they were in time,--which means abroad that they were at the\r\nstation half an hour before their train started,--and they went on\r\nupon their journey to Strasbourg.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing further to be told of their tour. They were but two\r\ndays and nights on the road from Basle to London; and during those\r\ntwo days and nights neither George nor Kate spoke a word to Alice of\r\nher marriage, nor was any allusion made to the balcony at the inn, or\r\nto the bridge over the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAunt Greenow.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Vavasor remained only three days in London before she started\r\nfor Yarmouth; and during those three days she was not much with her\r\ncousin. "I\'m my aunt\'s, body and soul, for the next six weeks," she\r\nsaid to Alice, when she did come to Queen Anne Street on the morning\r\nafter her arrival. "And she is exigeant in a manner I can\'t at all\r\nexplain to you. You mustn\'t be surprised if I don\'t even write a\r\nline. I\'ve escaped by stealth now. She went up-stairs to try on some\r\nnew weeds for the seaside, and then I bolted." She did not say a\r\nword about George; nor during those three days, nor for some days\r\nafterwards, did George show himself. As it turned out afterwards, he\r\nhad gone off to Scotland, and had remained a week among the grouse.\r\nThus, at least, he had accounted for himself and his movements; but\r\nall George Vavasor\'s friends knew that his goings out and comings in\r\nwere seldom accounted for openly like those of other men.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be as well to say a few words about Mrs. Greenow\r\nbefore we go with her to Yarmouth. Mrs. Greenow was the only daughter\r\nand the youngest child of the old squire at Vavasor Hall. She was\r\njust ten years younger than her brother John, and I am inclined to\r\nthink that she was almost justified in her repeated assertion that\r\nthe difference was much greater than ten years, by the freshness of\r\nher colour, and by the general juvenility of her appearance. She\r\ncertainly did not look forty, and who can expect a woman to proclaim\r\nherself to be older than her looks? In early life she had been taken\r\nfrom her father\'s house, and had lived with relatives in one of the\r\nlarge towns in the north of England. It is certain she had not been\r\nquite successful as a girl. Though she had enjoyed the name of being\r\na beauty, she had not the usual success which comes from such repute.\r\nAt thirty-four she was still unmarried. She had, moreover, acquired\r\nthe character of being a flirt; and I fear that the stories which\r\nwere told of her, though doubtless more than half false, had in\r\nthem sufficient of truth to justify the character. Now this was\r\nvery sad, seeing that Arabella Vavasor had no fortune, and that she\r\nhad offended her father and brothers by declining to comply with\r\ntheir advice at certain periods of her career. There was, indeed,\r\nconsiderable trouble in the minds of the various male Vavasors with\r\nreference to Arabella, when tidings suddenly reached the Hall that\r\nshe was going to be married to an old man.\r\n\r\nShe was married to the old man; and the marriage fortunately turned\r\nout satisfactorily, at any rate for the old man and for her family.\r\nThe Vavasors were relieved from all further trouble, and were as much\r\nsurprised as gratified when they heard that she did her duty well\r\nin her new position. Arabella had long been a thorn in their side,\r\nnever having really done anything which they could pronounce to be\r\nabsolutely wrong, but always giving them cause for fear. Now they\r\nfeared no longer. Her husband was a retired merchant, very rich, not\r\nvery strong in health, and devoted to his bride. Rumours soon made\r\ntheir way to Vavasor Hall, and to Queen Anne Street, that Mrs. Greenow\r\nwas quite a pattern wife, and that Mr. Greenow considered himself to\r\nbe the happiest old man in Lancashire. And now in her prosperity she\r\nquite forgave the former slights which had been put upon her by her\r\nrelatives. She wrote to her dear niece Alice, and to her dearest\r\nniece Kate, and sent little presents to her father. On one occasion\r\nshe took her husband to Vavasor Hall, and there was a regular renewal\r\nof all the old family feelings. Arabella\'s husband was an old\r\nman, and was very old for his age; but the whole thing was quite\r\nrespectable, and there was, at any rate, no doubt about the money.\r\nThen Mr. Greenow died; and the widow, having proved the will, came up\r\nto London and claimed the commiseration of her nieces.\r\n\r\n"Why not go to Yarmouth with her for a month?" George had said to\r\nKate. "Of course it will be a bore. But an aunt with forty thousand\r\npounds has a right to claim attention." Kate acknowledged the truth\r\nof the argument and agreed to go to Yarmouth for a month. "Your aunt\r\nArabella has shown herself to be a very sensible woman," the old\r\nsquire had written; "much more sensible than anybody thought her\r\nbefore her marriage. Of course you should go with her if she asks\r\nyou." What aunt, uncle, or cousin, in the uncontrolled possession of\r\nforty thousand pounds was ever unpopular in the family?\r\n\r\nYarmouth is not a very prepossessing place to the eye. To my eye,\r\nat any rate, it is not so. There is an old town with which summer\r\nvisitors have little or nothing to do; and there are the new houses\r\ndown by the sea-side, to which, at any rate, belongs the full\r\nadvantage of sea air. A kind of esplanade runs for nearly a mile\r\nalong the sands, and there are built, or in the course of building,\r\nrows of houses appropriated to summer visitors all looking out upon\r\nthe sea. There is no beauty unless the yellow sandy sea can be called\r\nbeautiful. The coast is low and straight, and the east wind blows\r\nfull upon it. But the place is healthy; and Mrs. Greenow was probably\r\nright in thinking that she might there revive some portion of the\r\nhealth which she had lost in watching beside the couch of her\r\ndeparting lord.\r\n\r\n"Omnibus;--no, indeed. Jeannette, get me a fly." These were the first\r\nwords Mrs. Greenow spoke as she put her foot upon the platform at the\r\nYarmouth station. Her maid\'s name was Jenny; but Kate had already\r\nfound, somewhat to her dismay, that orders had been issued before\r\nthey left London that the girl was henceforth to be called Jeannette.\r\nKate had also already found that her aunt could be imperious; but\r\nthis taste for masterdom had not shown itself so plainly in London\r\nas it did from the moment that the train had left the station at\r\nShoreditch. In London Mrs. Greenow had been among Londoners, and her\r\ncareer had hitherto been provincial. Her spirit, no doubt, had been\r\nsomewhat cowed by the novelty of her position. But when she felt\r\nherself to be once beyond the stones as the saying used to be, she\r\nwas herself again; and at Ipswich she had ordered Jeannette to get\r\nher a glass of sherry with an air which had created a good deal of\r\nattention among the guards and porters.\r\n\r\nThe fly was procured; and with considerable exertion all Mrs.\r\nGreenow\'s boxes, together with the more moderate belongings of her\r\nniece and maid, were stowed on the top of it, round upon the driver\'s\r\nbody on the coach box, on the maid\'s lap, and I fear in Kate\'s also,\r\nand upon the vacant seat.\r\n\r\n"The large house in Montpelier Parade," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"They is all large, ma\'am," said the driver.\r\n\r\n"The largest," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"They\'re much of a muchness," said the driver.\r\n\r\n"Then Mrs. Jones\'s," said Mrs. Greenow. "But I was particularly told\r\nit was the largest in the row."\r\n\r\n"I know Mrs. Jones\'s well," said the driver, and away they went.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones\'s house was handsome and comfortable; but I fear Mrs.\r\nGreenow\'s satisfaction in this respect was impaired by her\r\ndisappointment in finding that it was not perceptibly bigger than\r\nthose to the right and left of her. Her ambition in this and in\r\nother similar matters would have amused Kate greatly had she been\r\na bystander, and not one of her aunt\'s party. Mrs. Greenow was\r\ngood-natured, liberal, and not by nature selfish; but she was\r\ndetermined not to waste the good things which fortune had given, and\r\ndesired that all the world should see that she had forty thousand\r\npounds of her own. And in doing this she was repressed by no\r\nfeeling of false shame. She never hesitated in her demands through\r\nbashfulness. She called aloud for such comfort and grandeur as\r\nYarmouth could afford her, and was well pleased that all around\r\nshould hear her calling. Joined to all this was her uncontrolled\r\ngrief for her husband\'s death.\r\n\r\n"Dear Greenow! sweet lamb! Oh, Kate, if you\'d only known that man!"\r\nWhen she said this she was sitting in the best of Mrs. Jones\'s\r\nsitting-rooms, waiting to have dinner announced. She had taken a\r\ndrawing-room and dining-room, "because," as she had said, "she didn\'t\r\nsee why people should be stuffy when they went to the seaside;--not\r\nif they had means to make themselves comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kate, I do wish you\'d known him!"\r\n\r\n"I wish I had," said Kate,--very untruly. "I was unfortunately away\r\nwhen he went to Vavasor Hall."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; but it was at home, in the domestic circle, that Greenow\r\nshould have been seen to be appreciated. I was a happy woman,\r\nKate, while that lasted." And Kate was surprised to see that real\r\ntears--one or two on each side--were making their way down her\r\naunt\'s cheeks. But they were soon checked with a handkerchief of the\r\nbroadest hem and of the finest cambric.\r\n\r\n"Dinner, ma\'am," said Jeannette, opening the door.\r\n\r\n"Jeannette, I told you always to say that dinner was served."\r\n\r\n"Dinner\'s served then," said Jeannette in a tone of anger.\r\n\r\n"Come, Kate," said her aunt. "I\'ve but little appetite myself, but\r\nthere\'s no reason you shouldn\'t eat your dinner. I specially wrote to\r\nMrs. Jones to have some sweetbread. I do hope she\'s got a decent cook.\r\nIt\'s very little I eat myself, but I do like to see things nice."\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday; and it was beautiful to see how Mrs. Greenow\r\nwent to church in all the glory of widowhood. There had been a great\r\nunpacking after that banquet on the sweetbread, and all her funereal\r\nmillinery had been displayed before Kate\'s wondering eyes. The charm\r\nof the woman was in this,--that she was not in the least ashamed of\r\nanything that she did. She turned over all her wardrobe of mourning,\r\nshowing the richness of each article, the stiffness of the crape,\r\nthe fineness of the cambric, the breadth of the frills,--telling the\r\nprice of each to a shilling, while she explained how the whole had\r\nbeen amassed without any consideration of expense. This she did with\r\nall the pride of a young bride when she shows the glories of her\r\ntrousseau to the friend of her bosom. Jeannette stood by the while,\r\nremoving one thing and exhibiting another. Now and again through the\r\nperformance, Mrs. Greenow would rest a while from her employment, and\r\naddress the shade of the departed one in terms of most endearing\r\naffection. In the midst of this Mrs. Jones came in; but the widow was\r\nnot a whit abashed by the presence of the stranger. "Peace be to his\r\nmanes!" she said at last, as she carefully folded up a huge black\r\ncrape mantilla. She made, however, but one syllable of the classical\r\nword, and Mrs. Jones thought that her lodger had addressed herself to\r\nthe mortal "remains" of her deceased lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Peace be to his manes."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"He is left her uncommon well off, I suppose," said Mrs. Jones to\r\nJeannette.\r\n\r\n"You may say that, ma\'am. It\'s more nor a hundred thousand of\r\npounds!"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Pounds of sterling, ma\'am! Indeed it is;--to my knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t she have a carriage?"\r\n\r\n"So she do;--but a lady can\'t bring her carriage down to the sea when\r\nshe\'s only just buried her husband as one may say. What\'d folks say\r\nif they saw her in her own carriage? But it ain\'t because she can\'t\r\nafford it, Mrs. Jones. And now we\'re talking of it you must order a\r\nfly for church to-morrow, that\'ll look private, you know. She said I\r\nwas to get a man that had a livery coat and gloves."\r\n\r\nThe man with the coat and gloves was procured; and Mrs. Greenow\'s\r\nentry into church made quite a sensation. There was a thoughtfulness\r\nabout her which alone showed that she was a woman of no ordinary\r\npower. She foresaw all necessities, and made provision for all\r\nemergencies. Another would not have secured an eligible sitting, and\r\nbeen at home in Yarmouth church, till half the period of her sojourn\r\nthere was over. But Mrs. Greenow had done it all. She walked up the\r\nmiddle aisle with as much self-possession as though the chancel had\r\nbelonged to her family for years; and the respectable pew-opener\r\nabsolutely deserted two or three old ladies whom she was attending,\r\nto show Mrs. Greenow into her seat. When seated, she was the cynosure\r\nof all eyes. Kate Vavasor became immediately aware that a great\r\nsensation had been occasioned by their entrance, and equally aware\r\nthat none of it was due to her. I regret to say that this feeling\r\ncontinued to show itself throughout the whole service. How many\r\nladies of forty go to church without attracting the least attention!\r\nBut it is hardly too much to say that every person in that church had\r\nlooked at Mrs. Greenow. I doubt if there was present there a single\r\nmarried lady who, on leaving the building, did not speak to her\r\nhusband of the widow. There had prevailed during the whole two hours\r\na general though unexpressed conviction that something worthy of\r\nremark had happened that morning. It had an effect even upon the\r\ncurate\'s reading; and the incumbent, while preaching his sermon,\r\ncould not keep his eyes off that wonderful bonnet and veil.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, before eleven, Mrs. Greenow\'s name was put down\r\nat the Assembly Room. "I need hardly say that in my present condition\r\nI care nothing for these things. Of course I would sooner be alone.\r\nBut, my dear Kate, I know what I owe to you."\r\n\r\nKate, with less intelligence than might have been expected from one\r\nso clever, began to assure her aunt that she required no society;\r\nand that, coming thus with her to the seaside in the early days of\r\nher widowhood, she had been well aware that they would live retired.\r\nBut Mrs. Greenow soon put her down, and did so without the slightest\r\nfeeling of shame or annoyance on her own part. "My dear," she said,\r\n"in this matter you must let me do what I know to be right. I should\r\nconsider myself to be very selfish if I allowed my grief to interfere\r\nwith your amusements."\r\n\r\n"But, aunt, I don\'t care for such amusements."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, my dear. You ought to care for them. How are you to\r\nsettle yourself in life if you don\'t care for them?"\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, I am settled."\r\n\r\n"Settled!" said Mrs. Greenow, astounded, as though there must have\r\nbeen some hidden marriage of which she had not heard. "But that\'s\r\nnonsense. Of course you\'re not settled; and how are you to be, if I\r\nallow you to shut yourself up in such a place as this,--just where a\r\ngirl has a chance?"\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Kate tried to stop her. It was not easy to stop\r\nMrs. Greenow when she was supported by the full assurance of being\r\nmistress of the place and of the occasion. "No, my dear; I know very\r\nwell what I owe to you, and I shall do my duty. As I said before,\r\nsociety can have no charms now for such a one as I am. All that\r\nsocial intercourse could ever do for me lies buried in my darling\'s\r\ngrave. My heart is desolate, and must remain so. But I\'m not going to\r\nimmolate you on the altars of my grief. I shall force myself to go\r\nout for your sake, Kate."\r\n\r\n"But, dear aunt, the world will think it so odd, just at present."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care twopence for the world. What can the world do to me?\r\nI\'m not dependent on the world,--thanks to the care of that sainted\r\nlamb. I can hold my own; and as long as I can do that the world won\'t\r\nhurt me. No, Kate, if I think a thing\'s right I shall do it. I mean\r\nto make the place pleasant for you if I can, and the world may object\r\nif it likes."\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow was probably right in her appreciation of the value of\r\nher independence. Remarks may perhaps have been made by the world of\r\nYarmouth as to her early return to society. People, no doubt, did\r\nremind each other that old Greenow was hardly yet four months buried.\r\nMrs. Jones and Jeannette probably had their little jokes down-stairs.\r\nBut this did not hurt Mrs. Greenow. What was said, was not said in her\r\nhearing, Mrs. Jones\'s bills were paid every Saturday with admirable\r\npunctuality; and as long as this was done everybody about the\r\nhouse treated the lady with that deference which was due to the\r\nrespectability of her possessions. When a recently bereaved widow\r\nattempts to enjoy her freedom without money, then it behoves the\r\nworld to speak aloud;--and the world does its duty.\r\n\r\nNumerous people came to call at Montpelier Parade, and Kate was\r\nastonished to find that her aunt had so many friends. She was indeed\r\nso bewildered by these strangers that she could hardly ascertain whom\r\nher aunt had really known before, and whom she now saw for the first\r\ntime. Somebody had known somebody who had known somebody else, and\r\nthat was allowed to be a sufficient introduction,--always presuming\r\nthat the existing somebody was backed by some known advantages of\r\nmoney or position. Mrs. Greenow could smile from beneath her widow\'s\r\ncap in a most bewitching way. "Upon my word then she is really\r\nhandsome," Kate wrote one day to Alice. But she could also frown, and\r\nknew well how to put aside, or, if need be, to reprobate any attempt\r\nat familiarity from those whose worldly circumstances were supposed\r\nto be disadvantageous.\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt," said Kate one morning after their walk upon the pier,\r\n"how you did snub that Captain Bellfield!"\r\n\r\n"Captain Bellfield, indeed! I don\'t believe he\'s a captain at all. At\r\nany rate he has sold out, and the tradesmen have had a scramble for\r\nthe money. He was only a lieutenant when the 97th were in Manchester,\r\nand I\'m sure he\'s never had a shilling to purchase since that."\r\n\r\n"But everybody here seems to know him."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they do not know so much of him as I do. The idea of his\r\nhaving the impudence to tell me I was looking very well! Nothing can\r\nbe so mean as men who go about in that way when they haven\'t money\r\nenough in their pockets to pay their washerwomen."\r\n\r\n"But how do you know, aunt, that Captain Bellfield hasn\'t paid his\r\nwasherwoman?"\r\n\r\n"I know more than you think, my dear. It\'s my business. How could I\r\ntell whose attentions you should receive and whose you shouldn\'t, if\r\nI didn\'t inquire into these things?"\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Kate rebelled, or attempted to rebel against this\r\nmore than maternal care. She told her aunt that she was now nearly\r\nthirty, and that she had managed her own affairs, at any rate with\r\nsafety, for the last ten years;--but it was to no purpose. Kate would\r\nget angry; but Mrs. Greenow never became angry. Kate would be quite\r\nin earnest; but Mrs. Greenow would push aside all that her niece said\r\nas though it were worth nothing. Kate was an unmarried woman with a\r\nvery small fortune, and therefore, of course, was desirous of being\r\nmarried with as little delay as possible. It was natural that she\r\nshould deny that it was so, especially at this early date in their\r\nmutual acquaintance. When the niece came to know her aunt more\r\nintimately, there might be confidence between them, and then they\r\nwould do better. But Mrs. Greenow would spare neither herself nor her\r\npurse on Kate\'s behalf, and she would be a dragon of watchfulness in\r\nprotecting her from the evil desires of such useless men as Captain\r\nBellfield.\r\n\r\n"I declare, Kate, I don\'t understand you," she said one morning to\r\nher niece as they sat together over a late breakfast. They had fallen\r\ninto luxurious habits, and I am afraid it was past eleven o\'clock,\r\nalthough the breakfast things were still on the table. Kate would\r\nusually bathe before breakfast, but Mrs. Greenow was never out of her\r\nroom till half-past ten. "I like the morning for contemplation," she\r\nonce said. "When a woman has gone through all that I have suffered\r\nshe has a great deal to think of." "And it is so much more\r\ncomfortable to be a-thinking when one\'s in bed," said Jeannette, who\r\nwas present at the time. "Child, hold your tongue," said the widow.\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said Jeannette. But we\'ll return to the scene at the\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\n"What don\'t you understand, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"You only danced twice last night, and once you stood up with Captain\r\nBellfield."\r\n\r\n"On purpose to ask after that poor woman who washes his clothes\r\nwithout getting paid for it."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Kate; you didn\'t ask him anything of the kind, I\'m sure.\r\nIt\'s very provoking. It is indeed."\r\n\r\n"But what harm can Captain Bellfield do me?"\r\n\r\n"What good can he do you? That\'s the question. You see, my dear,\r\nyears will go by. I don\'t mean to say you ain\'t quite as young\r\nas ever you were, and nothing can be nicer and fresher than you\r\nare;--especially since you took to bathing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt, don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"My dear, the truth must be spoken. I declare I don\'t think I ever\r\nsaw a young woman so improvident as you are. When are you to begin to\r\nthink about getting married if you don\'t do it now?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never begin to think about it, till I buy my wedding\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense,--sheer nonsense. How are you to get wedding clothes\r\nif you have never thought about getting a husband? Didn\'t I see Mr.\r\nCheesacre ask you for a dance last night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did; while you were talking to Captain Bellfield yourself,\r\naunt."\r\n\r\n"Captain Bellfield can\'t hurt me, my dear. And why didn\'t you dance\r\nwith Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a fat Norfolk farmer, with not an idea beyond the virtues of\r\nstall-feeding."\r\n\r\n"My dear, every acre of it is his own land,--every acre! And he\r\nbought another farm for thirteen thousand pounds only last autumn.\r\nThey\'re better than the squires,--some of those gentlemen farmers;\r\nthey are indeed. And of all men in the world they\'re the easiest\r\nmanaged."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a recommendation, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is;--a great recommendation."\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow had no idea of joking when her mind was intent on serious\r\nthings. "He\'s to take us to the picnic to-morrow, and I do hope\r\nyou\'ll manage to let him sit beside you. It\'ll be the place of\r\nhonour, because he gives all the wine. He\'s picked up with that\r\nman Bellfield, and he\'s to be there; but if you allow your name to\r\nbe once mixed up with his, it will be all over with you as far as\r\nYarmouth is concerned."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t at all want to be mixed up with Captain Bellfield, as you\r\ncall it," said Kate. Then she subsided into her novel, while Mrs.\r\nGreenow busied herself about the good things for the picnic. In\r\ntruth, the aunt did not understand the niece. Whatsoever might be the\r\nfaults of Kate Vavasor, an unmaidenly desire of catching a husband\r\nfor herself was certainly not one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nYarmouth is not a happy place for a picnic. A picnic should be held\r\namong green things. Green turf is absolutely an essential. There\r\nshould be trees, broken ground, small paths, thickets, and hidden\r\nrecesses. There should, if possible, be rocks, old timber, moss, and\r\nbrambles. There should certainly be hills and dales,--on a small\r\nscale; and above all, there should be running water. There should be\r\nno expanse. Jones should not be able to see all Greene\'s movements,\r\nnor should Augusta always have her eye upon her sister Jane. But the\r\nspot chosen for Mr. Cheesacre\'s picnic at Yarmouth had none of the\r\nvirtues above described. It was on the seashore. Nothing was visible\r\nfrom the site but sand and sea. There were no trees there and nothing\r\ngreen;--neither was there any running water. But there was a long,\r\ndry, flat strand; there was an old boat half turned over, under which\r\nit was proposed to dine; and in addition to this, benches, boards,\r\nand some amount of canvas for shelter were provided by the liberality\r\nof Mr. Cheesacre. Therefore it was called Mr. Cheesacre\'s picnic.\r\n\r\nBut it was to be a marine picnic, and therefore the essential\r\nattributes of other picnics were not required. The idea had come from\r\nsome boating expeditions, in which mackerel had been caught, and\r\nduring which food had been eaten, not altogether comfortably, in the\r\nboats. Then a thought had suggested itself to Captain Bellfield that\r\nthey might land and eat their food, and his friend Mr. Cheesacre had\r\npromised his substantial aid. A lady had surmised that Ormesby sands\r\nwould be the very place for dancing in the cool of the evening. They\r\nmight "Dance on the sand," she said, "and yet no footing seen." And\r\nso the thing had progressed, and the picnic been inaugurated.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Cheesacre\'s picnic undoubtedly. Mr. Cheesacre was to supply\r\nthe boats, the wine, the cigars, the music, and the carpenter\'s work\r\nnecessary for the turning of the old boat into a banqueting saloon.\r\nBut Mrs. Greenow had promised to provide the eatables, and enjoyed as\r\nmuch of the _eclat_ as the master of the festival. She had known Mr.\r\nCheesacre now for ten days and was quite intimate with him. He was a\r\nstout, florid man, of about forty-five, a bachelor, apparently much\r\nattached to ladies\' society, bearing no sign of age except that he\r\nwas rather bald, and that grey hairs had mixed themselves with his\r\nwhiskers, very fond of his farming, and yet somewhat ashamed of it\r\nwhen he found himself in what he considered to be polite circles. And\r\nhe was, moreover, a little inclined to seek the honour which comes\r\nfrom a well-filled and liberally-opened purse. He liked to give a man\r\na dinner and then to boast of the dinner he had given. He was very\r\nproud when he could talk of having mounted, for a day\'s hunting, any\r\nman who might be supposed to be of higher rank than himself. "I had\r\nGrimsby with me the other day,--the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick,\r\nyou know. Blessed if he didn\'t stake my bay mare. But what matters? I\r\nmounted him again the next day just the same." Some people thought he\r\nwas soft, for it was very well known throughout Norfolk that young\r\nGrimsby would take a mount wherever he could get it. In these days\r\nMrs. Greenow had become intimate with Mr. Cheesacre, and had already\r\nlearned that he was the undoubted owner of his own acres.\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do for me," she had said to him, "to be putting myself\r\nforward, as if I were giving a party myself, or anything of that\r\nsort;--would it now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps not. But you might come with us."\r\n\r\n"So I will, Mr. Cheesacre, for that dear girl\'s sake. I should never\r\nforgive myself if I debarred her from all the pleasures of youth,\r\nbecause of my sorrows. I need hardly say that at such a time as this\r\nnothing of that sort can give me any pleasure."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not," said Mr. Cheesacre, with solemn look.\r\n\r\n"Quite out of the question." And Mrs. Greenow wiped away her tears.\r\n"For though as regards age I might dance on the sands as merrily as\r\nthe best of them--"\r\n\r\n"That I\'m sure you could, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"How\'s a woman to enjoy herself if her heart lies buried?"\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t be so always, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow shook her head to show that she hardly knew how to answer\r\nsuch a question. Probably it would be so always;--but she did not\r\nwish to put a damper on the present occasion by making so sad a\r\ndeclaration. "But as I was saying," continued she--"if you and I do\r\nit between us won\'t that be the surest way of having it come off\r\nnicely?"\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre thought that it would be the best way.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so;--I\'ll do the meat and pastry and fruit, and you shall do\r\nthe boats and the wine."\r\n\r\n"And the music," said Cheesacre, "and the expenses at the place." He\r\ndid not choose that any part of his outlay should go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go halves in all that if you like," said Mrs. Greenow. But Mr.\r\nCheesacre had declined this. He did not begrudge the expense, but\r\nonly wished that it should be recognised.\r\n\r\n"And, Mr. Cheesacre," continued Mrs. Greenow. "I did mean to send the\r\nmusic; I did, indeed."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t hear of it, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"But I mention it now, because I was thinking of getting Blowehard\r\nto come. That other man, Flutey, wouldn\'t do at all out in the open\r\nair."\r\n\r\n"It shall be Blowehard," said Mr. Cheesacre; and it was Blowehard. Mrs.\r\nGreenow liked to have her own way in these little things, though her\r\nheart did lie buried.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the picnic Mr. Cheesacre came down to Montpelier\r\nParade with Captain Bellfield, whose linen on that occasion certainly\r\ngave no outward sign of any quarrel between him and his washerwoman.\r\nHe was got up wonderfully, and was prepared at all points for the\r\nday\'s work. He had on a pseudo-sailor\'s jacket, very liberally\r\nornamented with brass buttons, which displayed with great judgement\r\nthe exquisite shapes of his pseudo-sailor\'s duck trousers. Beneath\r\nthem there was a pair of very shiny patent-leather shoes, well\r\nadapted for dancing on the sand, presuming him to be anxious of\r\ndoing so, as Venus offered to do, without leaving any footmarks. His\r\nwaistcoat was of a delicate white fabric, ornamented with very many\r\ngilt buttons. He had bejewelled studs in his shirt, and yellow kid\r\ngloves on his hands; having, of course, another pair in his pocket\r\nfor the necessities of the evening. His array was quite perfect, and\r\nhad stricken dismay into the heart of his friend Cheesacre, when he\r\njoined that gentleman. He was a well-made man, nearly six feet high,\r\nwith dark hair, dark whiskers, and dark moustache, nearly black, but\r\nof that suspicious hue which to the observant beholder seems always\r\nto tell a tale of the hairdresser\'s shop. He was handsome, too, with\r\nwell-arranged features,--but carrying, perhaps, in his nose some\r\nfirst symptoms of the effects of midnight amusements. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, he was a nice man to look at--for those who like to look on\r\nnice men of that kind.\r\n\r\nCheesacre, too, had adopted something of a sailor\'s garb. He had on\r\na jacket of a rougher sort, coming down much lower than that of the\r\ncaptain, being much looser, and perhaps somewhat more like a garment\r\nwhich a possible seaman might possibly wear. But he was disgusted\r\nwith himself the moment that he saw Bellfield. His heart had been\r\nfaint, and he had not dared to ornament himself boldly as his friend\r\nhad done. "I say, Guss, you are a swell," he exclaimed. It may be\r\nexplained that Captain Bellfield had been christened Gustavus.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about that," said the captain; "my fellow sent me\r\nthis toggery, and said that it was the sort of thing. I\'ll change\r\nwith you if you like it." But Cheesacre could not have worn that\r\njacket, and he walked on, hating himself.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Mrs. Greenow had spoken with considerable\r\nseverity of Captain Bellfield\'s pretensions when discussing his\r\ncharacter with her niece; but, nevertheless, on the present occasion\r\nshe received him with most gracious smiles. It may be that her\r\nestimate of his character had been altered, or that she was making\r\nsacrifice of her own feelings in consideration of Mr. Cheesacre, who\r\nwas known to be the captain\'s intimate friend. But she had smiles for\r\nboth of them. She had a wondrous power of smiling; and could, upon\r\noccasion, give signs of peculiar favour to half a dozen different\r\ngentlemen in as many minutes. They found her in the midst of hampers\r\nwhich were not yet wholly packed, while Mrs. Jones, Jeannette, and the\r\ncook of the household moved around her, on the outside of the circle,\r\nministering to her wants. She had in her hand an outspread clean\r\nnapkin, and she wore fastened round her dress a huge coarse apron,\r\nthat she might thus be protected from some possible ebullition of\r\ngravy, or escape of salad mixture, or cream; but in other respects\r\nshe was clothed in the fullest honours of widowhood. She had not\r\nmitigated her weeds by half an inch. She had scorned to make any\r\ncompromise between the world of pleasure and the world of woe. There\r\nshe was, a widow, declared by herself to be of four months\' standing,\r\nwith a buried heart, making ready a dainty banquet with skill and\r\nliberality. She was ready on the instant to sit down upon the baskets\r\nin which the grouse pie had been just carefully inhumed, and talked\r\nabout her sainted lamb with a deluge of tears. If anybody didn\'t like\r\nit, that person--might do the other thing. Mr. Cheesacre and Captain\r\nBellfield thought that they did like it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, if you haven\'t caught me before I\'ve half done!\r\nCaptain Bellfield, I hope you think my apron becoming."\r\n\r\n"Everything that you wear, Mrs. Greenow, is always becoming."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk in that way when you know--; but never mind--we will\r\nthink of nothing sad to-day if we can help it. Will we, Mr.\r\nCheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no; I should think not;--unless it should come on to rain."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t rain--we won\'t think of such a thing. But, by the by,\r\nCaptain Bellfield, I and my niece do mean to send out a few things,\r\njust in a bag you know, so that we may tidy ourselves up a little\r\nafter the sea. I don\'t want it mentioned, because if it gets about\r\namong the other ladies, they\'d think we wanted to make a dressing of\r\nit;--and there wouldn\'t be room for them all; would there?"\r\n\r\n"No; there wouldn\'t," said Mr. Cheesacre, who had been out on the\r\nprevious evening, inspecting, and perhaps limiting, the carpenters\r\nin their work.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Mrs. Greenow. "But there won\'t be any harm,\r\nwill there, Mr. Cheesacre, in Jeanette\'s going out with our things?\r\nShe\'ll ride in the cart, you know, with the eatables. I know\r\nJeannette\'s a friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"We shall be delighted to have Jeanette," said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Thank ye, sir," said Jeannette, with a curtsey.\r\n\r\n"Jeannette, don\'t you let Mr. Cheesacre turn your head; and mind you\r\nbehave yourself and be useful. Well; let me see;--what else is there?\r\nMrs. Jones, you might as well give me that ham now. Captain Bellfield,\r\nhand it over. Don\'t you put it into the basket, because you\'d turn it\r\nthe wrong side down. There now, if you haven\'t nearly made me upset\r\nthe apricot pie." Then, in the transfer of the dishes between the\r\ncaptain and the widow, there occurred some little innocent by-play,\r\nwhich seemed to give offence to Mr. Cheesacre; so that that gentleman\r\nturned his back upon the hampers and took a step away towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow saw the thing at a glance, and immediately applied\r\nherself to cure the wound. "What do you think, Mr. Cheesacre," said\r\nshe, "Kate wouldn\'t come down because she didn\'t choose that you\r\nshould see her with an apron on over her frock!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Nor I either. That\'s just what I said. Do step up into the\r\ndrawing-room; you\'ll find her there, and you can make her answer for\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t come down for me," said Mr. Cheesacre. But he didn\'t\r\nstir. Perhaps he wasn\'t willing to leave his friend with the widow.\r\n\r\nAt length the last of the dishes was packed and Mrs. Greenow went\r\nup-stairs with the two gentlemen. There they found Kate and two or\r\nthree other ladies who had promised to embark under the protection of\r\nMrs. Greenow\'s wings. There were the two Miss Fairstairs, whom Mrs.\r\nGreenow had especially patronized, and who repaid that lady for her\r\nkindness by an amount of outspoken eulogy which startled Kate by its\r\naudacity.\r\n\r\n"Your dear aunt!" Fanny Fairstairs had said on coming into the room.\r\n"I don\'t think I ever came across a woman with such genuine milk of\r\nhuman kindness!"\r\n\r\n"Nor with so much true wit," said her sister Charlotte,--who had been\r\ncalled Charlie on the sands of Yarmouth for the last twelve years.\r\n\r\nWhen the widow came into the room, they flew at her and devoured her\r\nwith kisses, and swore that they had never seen her looking so well.\r\nBut as the bright new gloves which both the girls wore had been\r\npresents from Mrs. Greenow, they certainly did owe her some affection.\r\nThere are not many ladies who would venture to bestow such gifts upon\r\ntheir friends after so very short an acquaintance; but Mrs. Greenow\r\nhad a power that was quite her own in such matters. She was already\r\non a very confidential footing with the Miss Fairstairs, and had\r\ngiven them much useful advice as to their future prospects.\r\n\r\nAnd then was there a Mrs. Green, whose husband was first-lieutenant on\r\nboard a man-of-war on the West Indian Station. Mrs. Green was a quiet,\r\nladylike little woman, rather pretty, very silent, and, as one would\r\nhave thought, hardly adapted for the special intimacy of Mrs. Greenow.\r\nBut Mrs. Greenow had found out that she was alone, not very rich,\r\nand in want of the solace of society. Therefore she had, from sheer\r\ngood-nature, forced herself upon Mrs. Green, and Mrs. Green, with much\r\ntrepidation, had consented to be taken to the picnic. "I know your\r\nhusband would like it," Mrs. Greenow had said, "and I hope I may live\r\nto tell him that I made you go."\r\n\r\nThere came in also a brother of the Fairstairs girls, Joe Fairstairs,\r\na lanky, useless, idle young man, younger than them, who was supposed\r\nto earn his bread in an attorney\'s office at Norwich, or rather to be\r\npreparing to earn it at some future time, and who was a heavy burden\r\nupon all his friends. "We told Joe to come to the house," said Fanny\r\nto the widow, apologetically, "because we thought he might be useful\r\nin carrying down the cloaks." Mrs. Greenow smiled graciously upon\r\nJoe, and assured him that she was charmed to see him, without any\r\nreference to such services as those mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnd then they started. When they got to the door both Cheesacre and\r\nthe captain made an attempt to get possession of the widow\'s arm. But\r\nshe had it all arranged. Captain Bellfield found himself constrained\r\nto attend to Mrs. Green, while Mr. Cheesacre walked down to the beach\r\nbeside Kate Vavasor. "I\'ll take your arm, Mr. Joe," said the widow,\r\n"and the girls shall come with us." But when they got to the boats,\r\nround which the other comers to the picnic were already assembled,\r\nMr. Cheesacre,--although both the boats were for the day his\r\nown,--found himself separated from the widow. He got into that which\r\ncontained Kate Vavasor, and was shoved off from the beach while he\r\nsaw Captain Bellfield arranging Mrs. Greenow\'s drapery. He had\r\ndeclared to himself that it should be otherwise; and that as he had\r\nto pay the piper, the piper should play as he liked it. But Mrs.\r\nGreenow with a word or two had settled it all, and Mr. Cheesacre had\r\nfound himself to be powerless. "How absurd Bellfield looks in that\r\njacket, doesn\'t he?" he said to Kate, as he took his seat in the boat.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for\r\nthe occasion."\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre hated Captain Bellfield, and regretted more than ever\r\nthat he had not done something for his own personal adornment. He\r\ncould not endure to think that his friend, who paid for nothing,\r\nshould carry away the honours of the morning and defraud him of the\r\ndelights which should justly belong to him, "It may be becoming,"\r\nsaid Cheesacre; "but don\'t you think it\'s awfully extravagant?"\r\n\r\n"As to that I can\'t tell. You see I don\'t at all know what is the\r\nprice of a jacket covered all over with little brass buttons."\r\n\r\n"And the waistcoat, Miss Vavasor!" said Cheesacre, almost solemnly.\r\n\r\n"The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dreadful! and he\'s got nothing, Miss Vavasor; literally nothing.\r\nDo you know,"--and he reduced his voice to a whisper as he made this\r\ncommunication,--"I lent him twenty pounds the day before yesterday;\r\nI did indeed. You won\'t mention it again, of course. I tell you,\r\nbecause, as you are seeing a good deal of him just now, I think it\r\nright that you should know on what sort of a footing he stands."\r\nIt\'s all fair, they say, in love and war, and this small breach of\r\nconfidence was, we must presume, a love stratagem on the part of Mr.\r\nCheesacre. He was at this time smitten with the charms both of the\r\nwidow and of the niece, and he constantly found that the captain was\r\ninterfering with him on whichever side he turned himself. On the\r\npresent occasion he had desired to take the widow for his share, and\r\nwas, upon the whole, inclined to think that the widow was the more\r\nworthy of his attentions. He had made certain little inquiries within\r\nthe last day or two, the answers to which had been satisfactory.\r\nThese he had by no means communicated to his friend, to whom, indeed,\r\nhe had expressed an opinion that Mrs. Greenow was after all only a\r\nflash in the pan. "She does very well pour passer le temps," the\r\ncaptain had answered. Mr. Cheesacre had not quite understood the exact\r\ngist of the captain\'s meaning, but had felt certain that his friend\r\nwas playing him false.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it to be mentioned again, Miss Vavasor," he continued.\r\n\r\n"Such things should not be mentioned at all," Kate replied,\r\nhaving been angered at the insinuation that the nature of Captain\r\nBellfield\'s footing could be a matter of any moment to her.\r\n\r\n"No, they shouldn\'t; and therefore I know that I\'m quite safe with\r\nyou, Miss Vavasor. He\'s a very pleasant fellow, very; and has seen\r\nthe world,--uncommon; but he\'s better for eating and drinking with\r\nthan he is for buying and selling with, as we say in Norfolk. Do you\r\nlike Norfolk, Miss Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"I never was in it before, and now I\'ve only seen Yarmouth."\r\n\r\n"A nice place, Yarmouth, very; but you should come up and see our\r\nlands. I suppose you don\'t know that we feed one-third of England\r\nduring the winter months."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!"\r\n\r\n"We do, though; nobody knows what a county Norfolk is. Taking it\r\naltogether, including the game you know, and Lord Nelson, and its\r\nwatering-places and the rest of it, I don\'t think there\'s a county\r\nin England to beat it. Fancy feeding one-third of all England and\r\nWales!"\r\n\r\n"With bread and cheese, do you mean, and those sort of things?"\r\n\r\n"Beef!" said Mr. Cheesacre, and in his patriotic energy he repeated\r\nthe word aloud. "Beef! Yes indeed; but if you were to tell them that\r\nin London they wouldn\'t believe you. Ah! you should certainly come\r\ndown and see our lands. The 7.45 A.M. train would take you through\r\nNorwich to my door, as one may say, and you would be back by the 6.22\r\nP.M." In this way he brought himself back again into good-humour,\r\nfeeling, that in the absence of the widow, he could not do better\r\nthan make progress with the niece.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mrs. Greenow and the captain were getting on very\r\ncomfortably in the other boat. "Take an oar, Captain," one of the\r\nmen had said to him as soon as he had placed the ladies. "Not to-day,\r\nJack," he had answered. "I\'ll content myself with being bo\'san this\r\nmorning." "The best thing as the bo\'san does is to pipe all hands to\r\ngrog," said the man. "I won\'t be behind in that either," said the\r\ncaptain; and so they all went on swimmingly.\r\n\r\n"What a fine generous fellow your friend, Mr. Cheesacre, is!" said the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is; he\'s a capital fellow in his way. Some of these Norfolk\r\nfarmers are no end of good fellows."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose he\'s something more than a common farmer. He\'s visited\r\nby the people about where he lives, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, in a sort of a way. The county people, you know, keep\r\nthemselves very much to themselves."\r\n\r\n"That\'s of course. But his house;--he has a good sort of place,\r\nhasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes;--a very good house;--a little too near to the horse-pond\r\nfor my taste. But when a man gets his money out of the till, he\r\nmustn\'t be ashamed of the counter;--must he, Mrs. Greenow?"\r\n\r\n"But he could live like a gentleman if he let his own land, couldn\'t\r\nhe?"\r\n\r\n"That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live." Here the privacy\r\nof their conversation was interrupted by an exclamation from a young\r\nlady to the effect that Charlie Fairstairs was becoming sick. This\r\nCharlie stoutly denied, and proved the truth of her assertion by her\r\nbehaviour. Soon after this they completed their marine adventures,\r\nand prepared to land close to the spot at which the banquet was\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe Rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been a pretence of fishing, but no fish had been caught.\r\nIt was soon found that such an amusement would interfere with the\r\nladies\' dresses, and the affairs had become too serious to allow of\r\nany trivial interruption. "I really think, Mr. Cheesacre," an anxious\r\nmother had said, "that you\'d better give it up. The water off the\r\nnasty cord has got all over Maria\'s dress, already." Maria made a\r\nfaint protest that it did not signify in the least; but the fishing\r\nwas given up,--not without an inward feeling on the part of Mr.\r\nCheesacre that if Maria chose to come out with him in his boat,\r\nhaving been invited especially to fish, she ought to have put up with\r\nthe natural results. "There are people who like to take everything\r\nand never like to give anything," he said to Kate afterwards, as he\r\nwas walking up with her to the picnic dinner. But he was unreasonable\r\nand unjust. The girls had graced his party with their best hats and\r\nfreshest muslins, not that they might see him catch a mackerel, but\r\nthat they might flirt and dance to the best advantage. "You can\'t\r\nsuppose that any girl will like to be drenched with sea-water when\r\nshe has taken so much trouble with her starch," said Kate. "Then she\r\nshouldn\'t come fishing," said Mr. Cheesacre. "I hate such airs."\r\n\r\nBut when they arrived at the old boat, Mrs. Greenow shone forth\r\npre-eminently as the mistress of the occasion, altogether\r\novershadowing Mr. Cheesacre by the extent of her authority. There was\r\na little contest for supremacy between them, invisible to the eyes\r\nof the multitude; but Mr. Cheesacre in such a matter had not a chance\r\nagainst Mrs. Greenow. I am disposed to think that she would have\r\nreigned even though she had not contributed to the eatables; but\r\nwith that point in her favour, she was able to make herself supreme.\r\nJeannette, too, was her servant, which was a great thing. Mr.\r\nCheesacre soon gave way; and though he bustled about and was\r\nconspicuous, he bustled about in obedience to orders received, and\r\nbecame a head servant. Captain Bellfield also made himself useful,\r\nbut he drove Mr. Cheesacre into paroxysms of suppressed anger by\r\ngiving directions, and by having those directions obeyed. A man to\r\nwhom he had lent twenty pounds the day before yesterday, and who had\r\nnot contributed so much as a bottle of champagne!\r\n\r\n"We\'re to dine at four, and now it\'s half-past three," said Mrs.\r\nGreenow, addressing herself to the multitude.\r\n\r\n"And to begin to dance at six," said an eager young lady.\r\n\r\n"Maria, hold your tongue," said the young lady\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'ll dine at four," said Mr. Cheesacre. "And as for the music,\r\nI\'ve ordered it to be here punctual at half-past five. We\'re to have\r\nthree horns, cymbals, triangle, and a drum."\r\n\r\n"How very nice; isn\'t it, Mrs. Greenow?" said Charlie Fairstairs.\r\n\r\n"And now suppose we begin to unpack," said Captain Bellfield. "Half\r\nthe fun is in arranging the things."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes; more than half," said Fanny Fairstairs.\r\n\r\n"Bellfield, don\'t mind about the hampers," said Cheesacre. "Wine is a\r\nticklish thing to handle, and there\'s my man there to manage it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s odd if I don\'t know more about wine than the boots from the\r\nhotel," said Bellfield. This allusion to the boots almost cowed Mr.\r\nCheesacre, and made him turn away, leaving Bellfield with the widow.\r\n\r\nThere was a great unpacking, during which Captain Bellfield and Mrs.\r\nGreenow constantly had their heads in the same hamper. I by no means\r\nintend to insinuate that there was anything wrong in this. People\r\nengaged together in unpacking pies and cold chickens must have their\r\nheads in the same hamper. But a great intimacy was thereby produced,\r\nand the widow seemed to have laid aside altogether that prejudice\r\nof hers with reference to the washerwoman. There was a long table\r\nplaced on the sand, sheltered by the upturned boat from the land\r\nside, but open towards the sea, and over this, supported on poles,\r\nthere was an awning. Upon the whole the arrangement was not an\r\nuncomfortable one for people who had selected so very uncomfortable\r\na dining-room as the sand of the sea-shore. Much was certainly due\r\nto Mr. Cheesacre for the expenditure he had incurred,--and something\r\nperhaps to Captain Bellfield for his ingenuity in having suggested\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow came the placing of the guests for dinner, and Mr. Cheesacre\r\nmade another great effort. "I\'ll tell you what," he said, aloud,\r\n"Bellfield and I will take the two ends of the table, and Mrs. Greenow\r\nshall sit at my right hand." This was not only boldly done, but there\r\nwas a propriety in it which at first sight seemed to be irresistible.\r\nMuch as he had hated and did hate the captain, he had skilfully made\r\nthe proposition in such a way as to flatter him, and it seemed for a\r\nfew moments as though he were going to have it all his own way. But\r\nCaptain Bellfield was not a man to submit to defeat in such a matter\r\nas this without an effort. "I don\'t think that will do," said he.\r\n"Mrs. Greenow gives the dinner, and Cheesacre gives the wine. We must\r\nhave them at the two ends of the table. I am sure Mrs. Greenow won\'t\r\nrefuse to allow me to hand her to the place which belongs to her. I\r\nwill sit at her right hand and be her minister." Mrs. Greenow did not\r\nrefuse,--and so the matter was adjusted.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre took his seat in despair. It was nothing to him that\r\nhe had Kate Vavasor at his left hand. He liked talking to Kate very\r\nwell, but he could not enjoy that pleasure while Captain Bellfield\r\nwas in the very act of making progress with the widow. "One would\r\nthink that he had given it himself; wouldn\'t you?" he said to Maria\'s\r\nmother, who sat at his right hand.\r\n\r\nThe lady did not in the least understand him. "Given what?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Why, the music and the wine and all the rest of it. There are some\r\npeople full of that kind of impudence. How they manage to carry it on\r\nwithout ever paying a shilling, I never could tell. I know I have to\r\npay my way, and something over and beyond generally."\r\n\r\nMaria\'s mother said, "Yes, indeed." She had other daughters there\r\nbesides Maria, and was looking down the table to see whether they\r\nwere judiciously placed. Her beauty, her youngest one, Ophelia, was\r\nsitting next to that ne\'er-do-well Joe Fairstairs, and this made\r\nher unhappy. "Ophelia, my dear, you are dreadfully in the draught;\r\nthere\'s a seat up here, just opposite, where you\'ll be more\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no draught here, mamma," said Ophelia, without the slightest\r\nsign of moving. Perhaps Ophelia liked the society of that lanky,\r\nidle, useless young man.\r\n\r\nThe mirth of the table certainly came from Mrs. Greenow\'s end. The\r\nwidow had hardly taken her place before she got up again and changed\r\nwith the captain. It was found that the captain could better carve\r\nthe great grouse pie from the end than from the side. Cheesacre, when\r\nhe saw this, absolutely threw down his knife and fork violently upon\r\nthe table. "Is anything the matter?" said Maria\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"Matter!" said he. Then he shook his head in grief of heart and\r\nvexation of spirit, and resumed his knife and fork. Kate watched\r\nit all, and was greatly amused. "I never saw a man so nearly\r\nbroken-hearted," she said, in her letter to Alice the next day.\r\n"Eleven, thirteen, eighteen, twenty-one," said Cheesacre to himself,\r\nreckoning up in his misery the number of pounds sterling which he\r\nwould have to pay for being ill-treated in this way.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen," said Captain Bellfield, as soon as the eating\r\nwas over, "if I may be permitted to get upon my legs for two minutes,\r\nI am going to propose a toast to you." The real patron of the feast\r\nhad actually not yet swallowed his last bit of cheese. The thing was\r\nindecent in the violence of its injustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Bellfield proposes a toast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"If you please, Captain Bellfield," said the patron, indifferent to\r\nthe cheese in his throat, "I\'ll propose the toast."\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth could be better, my dear fellow," said the captain,\r\n"and I\'m sure I should be the last man in the world to take the job\r\nout of the hands of one who would do it so much better than I can;\r\nbut as it\'s your health that we\'re going to drink, I really don\'t see\r\nhow you are to do it."\r\n\r\nCheesacre grunted and sat down. He certainly could not propose his\r\nown health, nor did he complain of the honour that was to be done\r\nhim. It was very proper that his health should be drunk, and he had\r\nnow to think of the words in which he would return thanks. But the\r\nextent of his horror may be imagined when Bellfield got up and made a\r\nmost brilliant speech in praise of Mrs. Greenow. For full five minutes\r\nhe went on without mentioning the name of Cheesacre. Yarmouth, he\r\nsaid, had never in his days been so blessed as it had been this year\r\nby the presence of the lady who was now with them. She had come among\r\nthem, he declared, forgetful of herself and of her great sorrows,\r\nwith the sole desire of adding something to the happiness of others.\r\nThen Mrs. Greenow had taken out her pocket-handkerchief, sweeping back\r\nthe broad ribbons of her cap over her shoulders. Altogether the scene\r\nwas very affecting, and Cheesacre was driven to madness. They were\r\nthe very words that he had intended to speak himself.\r\n\r\n"I hate all this kind of thing," he said to Kate. "It\'s so fulsome."\r\n\r\n"After-dinner speeches never mean anything," said Kate.\r\n\r\nAt last, when Bellfield had come to an end of praising Mrs. Greenow,\r\nhe told the guests that he wished to join his friend Mr. Cheesacre in\r\nthe toast, the more so as it could hardly be hoped that Mrs. Greenow\r\nwould herself rise to return thanks. There was no better fellow than\r\nhis friend Cheesacre, whom he had known for he would not say how\r\nmany years. He was quite sure they would all have the most sincere\r\npleasure in joining the health of Mr. Cheesacre with that of Mrs.\r\nGreenow. Then there was a clattering of glasses and a murmuring of\r\nhealths, and Mr. Cheesacre slowly got upon his legs.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very much obliged to this company," said he, "and to my friend\r\nBellfield, who really is,--but perhaps that doesn\'t signify now. I\'ve\r\nhad the greatest pleasure in getting up this little thing, and I\'d\r\nmade up my mind to propose Mrs. Greenow\'s health; but, h\'m, ha, no\r\ndoubt it has been in better hands. Perhaps, considering all things,\r\nBellfield might have waited."\r\n\r\n"With such a subject on my hands, I couldn\'t wait a moment."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t interrupt you, Captain Bellfield, and perhaps you\'ll let me\r\ngo on without interrupting me. We\'ve all drunk Mrs. Greenow\'s health,\r\nand I\'m sure she\'s very much obliged. So am I for the honour you\'ve\r\ndone me. I have taken some trouble in getting up this little thing,\r\nand I hope you like it. I think somebody said something about\r\nliberality. I beg to assure you that I don\'t think of that for a\r\nmoment. Somebody must pay for these sort of things, and I\'m always\r\nvery glad to take my turn. I dare say Bellfield will give us the\r\nnext picnic, and if he\'ll appoint a day before the end of the month,\r\nI shall be happy to be one of the party." Then he sat down with some\r\ninward satisfaction, fully convinced that he had given his enemy a\r\nfatal blow.\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth would give me so much pleasure," said Bellfield.\r\nAfter that he turned again to Mrs. Greenow and went on with his\r\nprivate conversation.\r\n\r\nThere was no more speaking, nor was there much time for other\r\nafter-dinner ceremonies. The three horns, the cymbals, the triangle,\r\nand the drum were soon heard tuning-up behind the banqueting-hall,\r\nand the ladies went to the further end of the old boat to make their\r\npreparations for the dance. Then it was that the thoughtful care of\r\nMrs. Greenow, in having sent Jeannette with brushes, combs, clean\r\nhandkerchiefs, and other little knick-knackeries, became so apparent.\r\nIt was said that the widow herself actually changed her cap,--which\r\nwas considered by some to be very unfair, as there had been an\r\nunderstanding that there should be no dressing. On such occasions\r\nladies are generally willing to forego the advantage of dressing\r\non the condition that other ladies shall forego the same advantage;\r\nbut when this compact is broken by any special lady, the treason\r\nis thought to be very treacherous. It is as though a fencer should\r\nremove the button from the end of his foil. But Mrs. Greenow was so\r\ngood-natured in tendering the services of Jeannette to all the young\r\nladies, and was so willing to share with others those good things of\r\nthe toilet which her care had provided, that her cap was forgiven her\r\nby the most of those present.\r\n\r\nWhen ladies have made up their minds to dance they will dance let the\r\ncircumstances of the moment be ever so antagonistic to that exercise.\r\nA ploughed field in February would not be too wet, nor the side of a\r\nhouse too uneven. In honest truth the sands of the seashore are not\r\nadapted for the exercise. It was all very well for Venus to make the\r\npromise, but when making it she knew that Adonis would not keep her\r\nto her word. Let any lightest-limbed nymph try it, and she will find\r\nthat she leaves most palpable footing. The sands in question were\r\ndoubtless compact, firm, and sufficiently moist to make walking on\r\nthem comfortable; but they ruffled themselves most uncomfortably\r\nunder the unwonted pressure to which they were subjected.\r\nNevertheless our friends did dance on the sands; finding, however,\r\nthat quadrilles and Sir Roger de Coverley suited them better than\r\npolkas and waltzes.\r\n\r\n"No, my friend, no," Mrs. Greenow said to Mr. Cheesacre when that\r\ngentleman endeavoured to persuade her to stand up; "Kate will be\r\ndelighted I am sure to join you,--but as for me, you must excuse me."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Cheesacre was not inclined at that moment to ask Kate Vavasor\r\nto dance with him. He was possessed by an undefined idea that Kate\r\nhad snubbed him, and as Kate\'s fortune was, as he said, literally\r\nnothing, he was not at all disposed to court her favour at the\r\nexpense of such suffering to himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite sure that I\'ll dance myself," said he, seating himself\r\nin a corner of the tent by Mrs. Greenow\'s side. Captain Bellfield at\r\nthat moment was seen leading Miss Vavasor away to a new place on\r\nthe sands, whither he was followed by a score of dancers; and Mr.\r\nCheesacre saw that now at last he might reap the reward for which he\r\nhad laboured. He was alone with the widow, and having been made bold\r\nby wine, had an opportunity of fighting his battle, than which none\r\nbetter could ever be found. He was himself by no means a poor man,\r\nand he despised poverty in others. It was well that there should be\r\npoor gentry, in order that they might act as satellites to those who,\r\nlike himself, had money. As to Mrs. Greenow\'s money, there was no\r\ndoubt. He knew it all to a fraction. She had spread for herself, or\r\nsome one else had spread for her, a report that her wealth was almost\r\nunlimited; but the forty thousand pounds was a fact, and any such\r\ninnocent fault as that little fiction might well be forgiven to a\r\nwoman endorsed with such substantial virtues. And she was handsome\r\ntoo. Mr. Cheesacre, as he regarded her matured charms, sometimes felt\r\nthat he should have been smitten even without the forty thousand\r\npounds. "By George! there\'s flesh and blood," he had once said to his\r\nfriend Bellfield before he had begun to suspect that man\'s treachery.\r\nHis admiration must then have been sincere, for at that time the\r\nforty thousand pounds was not an ascertained fact. Looking at the\r\nmatter in all its bearings Mr. Cheesacre thought that he couldn\'t do\r\nbetter. His wooing should be fair, honest, and above board. He was a\r\nthriving man, and what might not they two do in Norfolk if they put\r\ntheir wealth together?\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, you should join them," said Mrs. Greenow; "they\'ll\r\nnot half enjoy themselves without you. Kate will think that you mean\r\nto neglect her."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t dance, Mrs. Greenow, unless you like to stand up for a set."\r\n\r\n"No, my friend, no; I shall not do that. I fear you forget how recent\r\nhas been my bereavement. Your asking me is the bitterest reproach to\r\nme for having ventured to join your festive board."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour I didn\'t mean it, Mrs. Greenow. I didn\'t mean it,\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"I do not suspect you. It would have been unmanly."\r\n\r\n"And nobody can say that of me. There isn\'t a man or woman in Norfolk\r\nthat wouldn\'t say I was manly."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure of that."\r\n\r\n"I have my faults, I\'m aware."\r\n\r\n"And what are your faults, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Well; perhaps I\'m extravagant. But it\'s only in these kind of\r\nthings you know, when I spend a little money for the sake of making\r\nmy friends happy. When I\'m about, on the lands at home, I ain\'t\r\nextravagant, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"Extravagance is a great vice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I ain\'t extravagant in that sense;--not a bit in the world. But\r\nwhen a man\'s enamoured, and perhaps looking out for a wife, he does\r\nlike to be a little free, you know."\r\n\r\n"And are you looking out for a wife, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"If I told you I suppose you\'d only laugh at me."\r\n\r\n"No; indeed I would not. I am not given to joking when any one that I\r\nregard speaks to me seriously."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t you though? I\'m so glad of that. When one has really got a\r\nserious thing to say, one doesn\'t like to have fun poked at one."\r\n\r\n"And, besides, how could I laugh at marriages, seeing how happy I\r\nhave been in that condition?--so--very--happy," and Mrs. Greenow put\r\nup her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"So happy that you\'ll try it again some day; won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Never, Mr. Cheesacre; never. Is that the way you talk of serious\r\nthings without joking? Anything like love--love of that sort--is\r\nover for me. It lies buried under the sod with my poor dear departed\r\nsaint."\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Greenow,"--and Cheesacre, as he prepared to argue the\r\nquestion with her, got nearer to her in the corner behind the\r\ntable,--"But, Mrs. Greenow, care killed a cat, you know."\r\n\r\n"And sometimes I think that care will kill me."\r\n\r\n"No, by George; not if I can prevent it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind, Mr. Cheesacre; but there\'s no preventing such care\r\nas mine."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there though? I\'ll tell you what, Mrs. Greenow; I\'m in earnest,\r\nI am indeed. If you\'ll inquire, you\'ll find there isn\'t a fellow in\r\nNorfolk pays his way better than I do, or is better able to do it. I\r\ndon\'t pay a sixpence of rent, and I sit upon seven hundred acres of\r\nas good land as there is in the county. There\'s not an acre that\r\nwon\'t do me a bullock and a half. Just put that and that together,\r\nand see what it comes to. And, mind you, some of these fellows that\r\nfarm their own land are worse off than if they\'d rent to pay. They\'ve\r\nborrowed so much to carry on with, that the interest is more than\r\nrent. I don\'t owe a sixpence to ere a man or ere a company in the\r\nworld. I can walk into every bank in Norwich without seeing my\r\nmaster. There ain\'t any of my paper flying about, Mrs. Greenow. I\'m\r\nSamuel Cheesacre of Oileymead, and it\'s all my own." Mr. Cheesacre, as\r\nhe thus spoke of his good fortunes and firm standing in the world,\r\nbecame impetuous in the energy of the moment, and brought down his\r\nfist powerfully on the slight table before them. The whole fabric\r\nrattled, and the boat resounded, but the noise he had made seemed to\r\nassist him. "It\'s all my own, Mrs. Greenow, and the half of it shall\r\nbe yours if you\'ll please to take it;" then he stretched out his hand\r\nto her, not as though he intended to grasp hers in a grasp of love,\r\nbut as if he expected some hand-pledge from her as a token that she\r\naccepted the bargain.\r\n\r\n"If you\'d known Greenow, Mr. Cheesacre--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt he was a very good sort of man."\r\n\r\n"If you\'d known him, you would not have addressed me in this way."\r\n\r\n"What difference would that make? My idea is that care killed a cat,\r\nas I said before. I never knew what was the good of being unhappy.\r\nIf I find early mangels don\'t do on a bit of land, then I sow late\r\nturnips; and never cry after spilt milk. Greenow was the early\r\nmangels; I\'ll be the late turnips. Come then, say the word. There\r\nain\'t a bedroom in my house,--not one of the front ones,--that isn\'t\r\nmahogany furnished!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s furniture to me?" said Mrs. Greenow, with her handkerchief to\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Maria\'s mother stepped in under the canvas. It\r\nwas most inopportune. Mr. Cheesacre felt that he was progressing well,\r\nand was conscious that he had got safely over those fences in the\r\nrace which his bashfulness would naturally make difficult to him. He\r\nknew that he had done this under the influence of the champagne, and\r\nwas aware that it might not be easy to procure again a combination\r\nof circumstances that would be so beneficial to him. But now he was\r\ninterrupted just as he was expecting success. He was interrupted,\r\nand felt himself to be looking like a guilty creature under the eye\r\nof the strange lady. He had not a word to say; but drawing himself\r\nsuddenly a foot and half away from the widow\'s side, sat there\r\nconfessing his guilt in his face.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow felt no guilt, and was afraid of no strange eyes. "Mr.\r\nCheesacre and I are talking about farming," she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh; farming!" answered Maria\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre thinks that turnips are better than early mangels,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," said Cheesacre,\r\n\r\n"I prefer the early mangels," said Mrs. Greenow. "I don\'t think nature\r\never intended those late crops. What do you say, Mrs. Walker?"\r\n\r\n"I daresay Mr. Cheesacre understands what he\'s about when he\'s at\r\nhome," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"I know what a bit of land can do as well as any man in Norfolk,"\r\nsaid the gentleman.\r\n\r\n"It may be very well in Norfolk," said Mrs. Greenow, rising from her\r\nseat; "but the practice isn\'t thought much of in the other counties\r\nwith which I am better acquainted."\r\n\r\n"I\'d just come in to say that I thought we might be getting to the\r\nboats," said Mrs. Walker. "My Ophelia is so delicate." At this moment\r\nthe delicate Ophelia was to be seen, under the influence of the\r\nmusic, taking a distant range upon the sands with Joe Fairstairs\' arm\r\nround her waist. The attitude was justified by the tune that was in\r\nprogress, and there is no reason why a galop on the sands should have\r\nany special termination in distance, as it must have in a room. But,\r\nunder such circumstances, Mrs. Walker\'s solicitude was not\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe erratic steps of the distant dancers were recalled and\r\npreparations were made for the return journey. Others had strayed\r\nbesides the delicate Ophelia and the idle Joe, and some little time\r\nwas taken up in collecting the party. The boats had to be drawn down,\r\nand the boatmen fetched from their cans and tobacco-pipes. "I hope\r\nthey\'re sober," said Mrs. Walker, with a look of great dismay.\r\n\r\n"Sober as judges," said Bellfield, who had himself been looking after\r\nthe remains of Mr. Cheesacre\'s hampers, while that gentleman had been\r\nso much better engaged in the tent.\r\n\r\n"Because," continued Mrs. Walker, "I know that they play all manner of\r\ntricks when they\'re--in liquor. They\'d think nothing of taking us out\r\nto sea, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do wish they would," said Ophelia.\r\n\r\n"Ophelia, mind you come in the boat with me," said her mother, and\r\nshe looked very savage when she gave the order. It was Mrs. Walker\'s\r\nintention that that boat should not carry Joe Fairstairs. But Joe and\r\nher daughter together were too clever for her. When the boats went\r\noff she found herself to be in that one over which Mr. Cheesacre\r\npresided, while the sinning Ophelia with her good-for-nothing admirer\r\nwere under the more mirthful protection of Captain Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"Mamma will be so angry," said Ophelia, "and it was all your fault. I\r\ndid mean to go into the other boat. Don\'t, Mr. Fairstairs." Then they\r\ngot settled down in their seats, to the satisfaction, let us hope, of\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre had vainly endeavoured to arrange that Mrs. Greenow\r\nshould return with him. But not only was Captain Bellfield opposed\r\nto such a change in their positions, but so also was Mrs. Greenow. "I\r\nthink we\'d better go back as we came," she said, giving her hand to\r\nthe Captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," said Captain Bellfield. "Why should there be any\r\nchange? Cheesacre, old fellow, mind you look after Mrs. Walker. Come\r\nalong, my hearty." It really almost appeared that Captain Bellfield\r\nwas addressing Mrs. Greenow as "his hearty," but it must be presumed\r\nthat the term of genial endearment was intended for the whole boat\'s\r\nload. Mrs. Greenow took her place on the comfortable broad bench in\r\nthe stern, and Bellfield seated himself beside her, with the tiller\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going to steer, Captain Bellfield, I beg that you\'ll be\r\ncareful."\r\n\r\n"Careful,--and with you on board!" said the Captain. "Don\'t you know\r\nthat I would sooner perish beneath the waves than that a drop of\r\nwater should touch you roughly?"\r\n\r\n"But you see, we might perish beneath the waves together."\r\n\r\n"Together! What a sweet word that is;--perish together! If it were\r\nnot that there might be something better even than that, I would wish\r\nto perish in such company."\r\n\r\n"But I should not wish anything of the kind, Captain Bellfield, and\r\ntherefore pray be careful."\r\n\r\nThere was no perishing by water on that occasion. Mr. Cheesacre\'s boat\r\nreached the pier at Yarmouth first, and gave up its load without\r\naccident. Very shortly afterwards Captain Bellfield\'s crew reached\r\nthe same place in the same state of preservation. "There," said he,\r\nas he handed out Mrs. Greenow. "I have brought you to no harm, at any\r\nrate as yet."\r\n\r\n"And, as I hope, will not do so hereafter."\r\n\r\n"May the heavens forbid it, Mrs. Greenow! Whatever may be our lots\r\nhereafter,--yours I mean and mine,--I trust that yours may be free\r\nfrom all disaster. Oh, that I might venture to hope that, at some\r\nfuture day, the privilege might be mine of protecting you from all\r\ndanger!"\r\n\r\n"I can protect myself very well, I can assure you. Good night,\r\nCaptain Bellfield. We won\'t take you and Mr. Cheesacre out of your\r\nway;--will we, Kate? We have had a most pleasant day."\r\n\r\nThey were now upon the esplanade, and Mrs. Greenow\'s house was to the\r\nright, whereas the lodgings of both the gentlemen were to the left.\r\nEach of them fought hard for the privilege of accompanying the widow\r\nto her door; but Mrs. Greenow was self-willed, and upon this occasion\r\nwould have neither of them. "Mr. Joe Fairstairs must pass the house,"\r\nsaid she, "and he will see us home. Mr. Cheesacre, good night. Indeed\r\nyou shall not;--not a step." There was that in her voice which\r\ninduced Mr. Cheesacre to obey her, and which made Captain Bellfield\r\naware that he would only injure his cause if he endeavoured to make\r\nfurther progress in it on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n"Well, Kate, what do you think of the day?" the aunt said when she\r\nwas alone with her niece.\r\n\r\n"I never think much about such days, aunt. It was all very well, but\r\nI fear I have not the temperament fitted for enjoying the fun. I\r\nenvied Ophelia Walker because she made herself thoroughly happy."\r\n\r\n"I do like to see girls enjoy themselves," said Mrs. Greenow, "I do,\r\nindeed;--and young men too. It seems so natural; why shouldn\'t young\r\npeople flirt?"\r\n\r\n"Or old people either for the matter of that?"\r\n\r\n"Or old people either,--if they don\'t do any harm to anybody. I\'ll\r\ntell you what it is, Kate; people have become so very virtuous, that\r\nthey\'re driven into all manner of abominable resources for amusement\r\nand occupation. If I had sons and daughters I should think a little\r\nflirting the very best thing for them as a safety valve. When people\r\nget to be old, there\'s a difficulty. They want to flirt with the\r\nyoung people and the young people don\'t want them. If the old people\r\nwould be content to flirt together, I don\'t see why they should ever\r\ngive it up;--till they\'re obliged to give up every thing, and go\r\naway."\r\n\r\nThat was Mrs. Greenow\'s doctrine on the subject of flirtation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nNethercoats.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will leave Mrs. Greenow with her niece and two sisters at Yarmouth,\r\nand returning by stages to London, will call upon Mr. Grey at his\r\nplace in Cambridgeshire as we pass by. I believe it is conceded by\r\nall the other counties, that Cambridgeshire possesses fewer rural\r\nbeauties than any other county in England. It is very flat; it is\r\nnot well timbered; the rivers are merely dikes; and in a very large\r\nportion of the county the farms and fields are divided simply by\r\nditches--not by hedgerows. Such arrangements are, no doubt, well\r\nadapted for agricultural purposes, but are not conducive to rural\r\nbeauty. Mr. Grey\'s residence was situated in a part of Cambridgeshire\r\nin which the above-named characteristics are very much marked. It was\r\nin the Isle of Ely, some few miles distant from the Cathedral town,\r\non the side of a long straight road, which ran through the fields\r\nfor miles without even a bush to cheer it. The name of his place was\r\nNethercoats, and here he lived generally throughout the year, and\r\nhere he intended to live throughout his life.\r\n\r\nHis father had held a prebendal stall at Ely in times when prebendal\r\nstalls were worth more than they are at present, and having also\r\nbeen possessed of a living in the neighbourhood, had amassed a\r\nconsiderable sum of money. With this he had during his life purchased\r\nthe property of Nethercoats, and had built on it the house in which\r\nhis son now lived. He had married late in life, and had lost his wife\r\nsoon after the birth of an only child. The house had been built in\r\nhis own parish, and his wife had lived there for a few months and had\r\ndied there. But after that event the old clergyman had gone back to\r\nhis residence in the Close at Ely, and there John Grey had had the\r\nhome of his youth. He had been brought up under his father\'s eye,\r\nhaving been sent to no public school. But he had gone to Cambridge,\r\nhad taken college honours, and had then, his father dying exactly at\r\nthis time, declined to accept a fellowship. His father had left to\r\nhim an income of some fifteen hundred a year, and with this he sat\r\nhimself down, near to his college friends, near also to the old\r\ncathedral which he loved, in the house which his father had built.\r\n\r\nBut though Nethercoats possessed no beauty of scenery, though the\r\ncountry around it was in truth as uninteresting as any country\r\ncould be, it had many delights of its own. The house itself was as\r\nexcellent a residence for a country gentleman of small means as\r\ntaste and skill together could construct. I doubt whether prettier\r\nrooms were ever seen than the drawing-room, the library, and the\r\ndining-room at Nethercoats. They were all on the ground-floor, and\r\nall opened out on to the garden and lawn. The library, which was\r\nthe largest of the three, was a handsome chamber, and so filled as\r\nto make it well known in the University as one of the best private\r\ncollections in that part of England. But perhaps the gardens of\r\nNethercoats constituted its greatest glory. They were spacious\r\nand excellently kept up, and had been originally laid out with\r\nthat knowledge of gardening without which no garden, merely as a\r\ngarden, can be effective. And such, of necessity, was the garden of\r\nNethercoats. Fine single forest trees there were none there, nor was\r\nit possible that there should have been any such. Nor could there\r\nbe a clear rippling stream with steep green banks, and broken rocks\r\nlying about its bed. Such beauties are beauties of landscape, and do\r\nnot of their nature belong to a garden. But the shrubs of Nethercoats\r\nwere of the rarest kind, and had been long enough in their present\r\nplaces to have reached the period of their beauty. Nothing had been\r\nspared that a garden could want. The fruit-trees were perfect in\r\ntheir kind, and the glass-houses were so good and so extensive that\r\nJohn Grey in his prudence was some times tempted to think that he had\r\ntoo much of them.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that there were no grounds, according to\r\nthe meaning usually given to that word, belonging to the house at\r\nNethercoats. Between the garden and the public road there was a\r\npaddock belonging to the house, along the side of which, but divided\r\nfrom it by a hedge and shrubbery, ran the private carriageway up to\r\nthe house. This swept through the small front flower-garden, dividing\r\nit equally; but the lawns and indeed the whole of that which made\r\nthe beauty of the place lay on the back of the house, on which side\r\nopened the windows from the three sitting-rooms. Down on the public\r\nroad there stood a lodge at which lived one of the gardeners. There\r\nwas another field of some six or seven acres, to which there was\r\na gate from the corner of the front paddock, and which went round\r\ntwo sides of the garden. This was Nethercoats, and the whole estate\r\ncovered about twelve acres.\r\n\r\nIt was not a place for much bachelor enjoyment of that sort generally\r\npopular with bachelors; nevertheless Mr. Grey had been constant in his\r\nresidence there for the seven years which had now elapsed since he\r\nhad left his college. His easy access to Cambridge had probably done\r\nmuch to mitigate what might otherwise have been the too great tedium\r\nof his life; and he had, prompted thereto by early associations,\r\nfound most of his society in the Close of Ely Cathedral. But, with\r\nall the delight he could derive from these two sources, there had\r\nstill been many solitary hours in his life, and he had gradually\r\nlearned to feel that he of all men wanted a companion in his home.\r\n\r\nHis visits to London had generally been short and far between,\r\noccasioned probably by some need in the library, or by the necessity\r\nof some slight literary transaction with the editor or publisher of a\r\nperiodical. In one of these visits he had met Alice Vavasor, and had\r\nremained in Town,--I will not say till Alice had promised to share\r\nhis home in Cambridgeshire, but so long that he had resolved before\r\nhe went that he would ask her to do so. He had asked her, and we\r\nknow that he had been successful. He had obtained her promise, and\r\nfrom that moment all his life had been changed for him. Hitherto at\r\nNethercoats his little smoking-room, his books, and his plants had\r\nbeen everything to him. Now he began to surround himself with an\r\ninfinity of feminine belongings, and to promise himself an infinity\r\nof feminine blessings, wondering much that he should have been\r\ncontent to pass so long a portion of his life in the dull seclusion\r\nwhich he had endured. He was not by nature an impatient man; but now\r\nhe became impatient, longing for the fruition of his new idea of\r\nhappiness,--longing to have that as his own which he certainly loved\r\nbeyond all else in the world, and which, perhaps, was all he had ever\r\nloved with the perfect love of equality. But though impatient, and\r\nfully aware of his own impatience, he acknowledged to himself that\r\nAlice could not be expected to share it. He could plan nothing\r\nnow,--could have no pleasure in life that she was not expected to\r\nshare. But as yet it could not be so with her. She had her house\r\nin London, her town society, and her father. And, inasmuch as the\r\nchange for her would be much greater than it would be for him, it was\r\nnatural that she should require some small delay. He had not pressed\r\nher. At least he had not pressed her with that eager pressure which\r\na girl must resist with something of the opposition of a contest,\r\nif she resist it at all. But in truth his impatience was now waxing\r\nstrong, and during the absence in Switzerland of which we have\r\nspoken, he resolved that a marriage very late in the autumn,--that a\r\nmarriage even in winter, would be better than a marriage postponed\r\ntill the following year. It was not yet late in August when the party\r\nreturned from their tour. Would not a further delay of two months\r\nsuffice for his bride?\r\n\r\nAlice had written to him occasionally from Switzerland, and her\r\nfirst two letters had been very charming. They had referred almost\r\nexclusively to the tour, and had been made pleasant with some\r\nslightly coloured account of George Vavasor\'s idleness, and of Kate\'s\r\nobedience to her brother\'s behests. Alice had never written much of\r\nlove in her love-letters, and Grey was well enough contented with her\r\nstyle, though it was not impassioned. As for doubting her love, it\r\nwas not in the heart of the man to do so after it had been once\r\nassured to him by her word. He could not so slightly respect himself\r\nor her as to leave room for such a doubt in his bosom. He was a man\r\nwho could never have suggested to himself that a woman loved him till\r\nthe fact was there before him; but who having ascertained, as he\r\nmight think, the fact, could never suggest to himself that her love\r\nwould fail him. Her first two letters from Switzerland had been very\r\npleasant; but after that there had seemed to have crept over her a\r\nmelancholy which she unconsciously transferred to her words, and\r\nwhich he could not but taste in them,--at first unconsciously, also,\r\nbut soon with so plain a flavour that he recognised it, and made it a\r\nmatter of mental inquiry. During the three or four last days of the\r\njourney, while they were at Basle and on their way home, she had not\r\nwritten. But she did write on the day after her arrival, having then\r\nreceived from Mr. Grey a letter, in which he told her how very much\r\nshe would add to his happiness if she would now agree that their\r\nmarriage should not be postponed beyond the end of October. This\r\nletter she found in her room on her return, and this she answered at\r\nonce. And she answered it in such words that Mr. Grey resolved that he\r\nwould at once go to her in London. I will give her letter at length,\r\nas I shall then be best able to proceed with my story quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Queen Anne Street,\r\n   -- August, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST JOHN,--\r\n\r\n   We reached home yesterday tired enough, as we came through\r\n   from Paris without stopping. I may indeed say that we\r\n   came through from Strasbourg, as we only slept in Paris.\r\n   I don\'t like Strasbourg. A steeple, after all, is not\r\n   everything, and putting the steeple aside, I don\'t think\r\n   the style is good. But the hotel was uncomfortable, which\r\n   goes for so much;--and then we were saturated with beauty\r\n   of a better kind.\r\n\r\n   I got your letter directly I came in last night, and\r\n   I suppose I had better dash at it at once. I would so\r\n   willingly delay doing so, saying nice little things the\r\n   while, did I not know that this would be mere cowardice.\r\n   Whatever happens I won\'t be a coward, and therefore I will\r\n   tell you at once that I cannot let you hope that we should\r\n   be married this year. Of course you will ask me why,\r\n   as you have a right to do, and of course I am bound to\r\n   answer. I do not know that I can give any answer with\r\n   which you will not have a right to complain. If it be so,\r\n   I can only ask your pardon for the injury I am doing you.\r\n\r\n   Marriage is a great change in life,--much greater to me\r\n   than to you, who will remain in your old house, will keep\r\n   your old pursuits, will still be your own master, and will\r\n   change in nothing,--except in this, that you will have a\r\n   companion who probably may not be all that you expect.\r\n   But I must change everything. It will be to me as though\r\n   I were passing through a grave to a new world. I shall\r\n   see nothing that I have been accustomed to see, and must\r\n   abandon all the ways of life that I have hitherto adopted.\r\n   Of course I should have thought of this before I accepted\r\n   you; and I did think of it. I made up my mind that, as I\r\n   truly loved you, I would risk the change;--that I would\r\n   risk it for your sake and for mine, hoping that I might\r\n   add something to your happiness, and that I might secure\r\n   my own. Dear John, do not suppose that I despair that it\r\n   may be so; but, indeed, you must not hurry me. I must tune\r\n   myself to the change that I have to make. What if I should\r\n   wake some morning after six months living with you, and\r\n   tell you that the quiet of your home was making me mad?\r\n\r\n   You must not ask me again till the winter shall have\r\n   passed away. If in the meantime I shall find that I have\r\n   been wrong, I will humbly confess that I have wronged\r\n   you, and ask you to forgive me. And I will freely admit\r\n   this. If the delay which I now purpose is so contrary\r\n   to your own plans as to make your marriage, under such\r\n   circumstances, not that which you had expected, I know\r\n   that you are free to tell me so, and to say that our\r\n   engagement shall be over. I am well aware that I can have\r\n   no right to bind you to a marriage at one period which you\r\n   had only contemplated as to take place at another period.\r\n   I think I may promise that I will obey any wish you may\r\n   express in anything,--except in that one thing which you\r\n   urged in your last letter.\r\n\r\n   Kate is going down to Yarmouth with Mrs. Greenow, and I\r\n   shall see no more of her probably till next year, as she\r\n   will be due in Westmoreland after that. George left me at\r\n   the door when he brought me home, and declared that he\r\n   intended to vanish out of London. Whether in town or out,\r\n   he is never to be seen at this period of the year. Papa\r\n   offers to go to Ramsgate for a fortnight, but he looks so\r\n   wretched when he makes the offer, that I shall not have\r\n   the heart to hold him to it. Lady Macleod very much wants\r\n   me to go to Cheltenham. I very much want not to go, simply\r\n   because I can never agree with her about anything; but\r\n   it will probably end in my going there for a week or two.\r\n   Over and beyond that, I have no prospects before Christmas\r\n   which are not purely domestic. There is a project that we\r\n   shall all eat our Christmas dinner at Vavasor Hall,--of\r\n   course not including George,--but this project is quite\r\n   in the clouds, and, as far as I am concerned, will remain\r\n   there.\r\n\r\n   Dear John, let me hear that this letter does not make you\r\n   unhappy.\r\n\r\n   Most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n   ALICE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Nethercoats, the post was brought in at breakfast-time, and Mr.\r\nGrey was sitting with his tea and eggs before him, when he read\r\nAlice\'s letter. He read it twice before he began to think what he\r\nwould do in regard to it, and then referred to one or two others\r\nwhich he had received from Switzerland,--reading them also very\r\ncarefully. After that, he took up the slouch hat which he had been\r\nwearing in the garden before he was called to his breakfast, and,\r\nwith the letters in his hand, sauntered down among the shrubs and\r\nlawns.\r\n\r\nHe knew, he thought he knew, that there was more in Alice\'s mind than\r\na mere wish for delay. There was more in it than that hesitation to\r\ntake at once a step which she really desired to take, if not now,\r\nthen after some short interval. He felt that she was unhappy, and\r\nunhappy because she distrusted the results of her marriage; but it\r\nnever for a moment occurred to him that, therefore, the engagement\r\nbetween them should be broken. In the first place he loved her too\r\nwell to allow of his admitting such an idea without terrible sorrow\r\nto himself. He was a constant, firm man, somewhat reserved, and\r\nunwilling to make new acquaintances, and, therefore, specially\r\nunwilling to break away from those which he had made. Undoubtedly,\r\nhad he satisfied himself that Alice\'s happiness demanded such a\r\nsacrifice of himself, he would have made it, and made it without a\r\nword of complaint. The blow would not have prostrated him, but the\r\nbruise would have remained on his heart, indelible, not to be healed\r\nbut by death. He would have submitted, and no man would have seen\r\nthat he had been injured. But it did not once occur to him that such\r\na proceeding on his part would be beneficial to Alice. Without being\r\naware of it, he reckoned himself to be the nobler creature of the\r\ntwo, and now thought of her as of one wounded, and wanting a cure.\r\nSome weakness had fallen on her, and strength must be given to her\r\nfrom another. He did not in the least doubt her love, but he knew\r\nthat she had been associated, for a few weeks past, with two persons\r\nwhose daily conversation would be prone to weaken the tone of her\r\nmind. He no more thought of giving her up than a man thinks of having\r\nhis leg cut off because he has sprained his sinews. He would go up to\r\ntown and see her, and would not even yet abandon all hope that she\r\nmight be found sitting at his board when Christmas should come. By\r\nthat day\'s post he wrote a short note to her.\r\n\r\n"Dearest Alice," he said, "I have resolved to go to London at once. I\r\nwill be with you in the evening at eight, the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\n"Yours, J. G."\r\n\r\nThere was no more in the letter than that.\r\n\r\n"And now," she said, when she received it, "I must dare to tell him\r\nthe whole truth."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nJohn Grey Goes to London.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what was the whole truth? Alice Vavasor, when she declared to\r\nherself that she must tell her lover the whole truth, was expressing\r\nto herself her intention of putting an end to her engagement with Mr.\r\nGrey. She was acknowledging that that which had to be told was not\r\ncompatible with the love and perfect faith which she owed to the man\r\nwho was her affianced husband. And yet, why should it be so? She did\r\nnot intend to tell him that she had been false in her love to him.\r\nIt was not that her heart had again veered itself round and given\r\nitself to that wild cousin of hers. Though she might feel herself\r\nconstrained to part from John Grey, George Vavasor could never be her\r\nhusband. Of that she assured herself fifty times during the two days\'\r\ngrace which had been allowed her. Nay, she went farther than that\r\nwith herself, and pronounced a verdict against any marriage as\r\npossible to her if she now decided against this marriage which had\r\nfor some months past been regarded as fixed by herself and all her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nPeople often say that marriage is an important thing, and should be\r\nmuch thought of in advance, and marrying people are cautioned that\r\nthere are many who marry in haste and repent at leisure. I am not\r\nsure, however, that marriage may not be pondered over too much; nor\r\ndo I feel certain that the leisurely repentance does not as often\r\nfollow the leisurely marriages as it does the rapid ones. That some\r\nrepent no one can doubt; but I am inclined to believe that most men\r\nand women take their lots as they find them, marrying as the birds\r\ndo by force of nature, and going on with their mates with a general,\r\nthough not perhaps an undisturbed satisfaction, feeling inwardly\r\nassured that Providence, if it have not done the very best for them,\r\nhas done for them as well as they could do for themselves with all\r\nthe thought in the world. I do not know that a woman can assure to\r\nherself, by her own prudence and taste, a good husband any more than\r\nshe can add two cubits to her stature; but husbands have been made\r\nto be decently good,--and wives too, for the most part, in our\r\ncountry,--so that the thing does not require quite so much thinking\r\nas some people say.\r\n\r\nThat Alice Vavasor had thought too much about it, I feel quite sure.\r\nShe had gone on thinking of it till she had filled herself with a\r\ncloud of doubts which even the sunshine of love was unable to drive\r\nfrom her heavens. That a girl should really love the man she intends\r\nto marry,--that, at any rate, may be admitted. But love generally\r\ncomes easily enough. With all her doubts Alice never doubted her love\r\nfor Mr. Grey. Nor did she doubt his character, nor his temper, nor his\r\nmeans. But she had gone on thinking of the matter till her mind had\r\nbecome filled with some undefined idea of the importance to her of\r\nher own life. What should a woman do with her life? There had arisen\r\nround her a flock of learned ladies asking that question, to whom it\r\nseems that the proper answer has never yet occurred. Fall in love,\r\nmarry the man, have two children, and live happy ever afterwards.\r\nI maintain that answer has as much wisdom in it as any other that\r\ncan be given;--or perhaps more. The advice contained in it cannot,\r\nperhaps, always be followed to the letter; but neither can the advice\r\nof the other kind, which is given by the flock of learned ladies who\r\nask the question.\r\n\r\nA woman\'s life is important to her,--as is that of a man to him,--not\r\nchiefly in regard to that which she shall do with it. The chief thing\r\nfor her to look to is the manner in which that something shall be\r\ndone. It is of moment to a young man when entering life to decide\r\nwhether he shall make hats or shoes; but not of half the moment that\r\nwill be that other decision, whether he shall make good shoes or bad.\r\nAnd so with a woman;--if she shall have recognised the necessity of\r\ntruth and honesty for the purposes of her life, I do not know that\r\nshe need ask herself many questions as to what she will do with it.\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor was ever asking herself that question, and had by\r\ndegrees filled herself with a vague idea that there was a something\r\nto be done; a something over and beyond, or perhaps altogether beside\r\nthat marrying and having two children;--if she only knew what it was.\r\nShe had filled herself, or had been filled by her cousins, with an\r\nundefined ambition that made her restless without giving her any real\r\nfood for her mind. When she told herself that she would have no scope\r\nfor action in that life in Cambridgeshire which Mr. Grey was preparing\r\nfor her, she did not herself know what she meant by action. Had any\r\none accused her of being afraid to separate herself from London\r\nsociety, she would have declared that she went very little into\r\nsociety and disliked that little. Had it been whispered to her that\r\nshe loved the neighbourhood of the shops, she would have scorned the\r\nwhisperer. Had it been suggested that the continued rattle of the big\r\ncity was necessary to her happiness, she would have declared that she\r\nand her father had picked out for their residence the quietest street\r\nin London because she could not bear noise;--and yet she told herself\r\nthat she feared to be taken into the desolate calmness of\r\nCambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nWhen she did contrive to find any answer to that question as to what\r\nshe should do with her life,--or rather what she would wish to do\r\nwith it if she were a free agent, it was generally of a political\r\nnature. She was not so far advanced as to think that women should be\r\nlawyers and doctors, or to wish that she might have the privilege of\r\nthe franchise for herself; but she had undoubtedly a hankering after\r\nsome second-hand political manoeuvering. She would have liked, I\r\nthink, to have been the wife of the leader of a Radical opposition,\r\nin the time when such men were put into prison, and to have kept up\r\nfor him his seditious correspondence while he lay in the Tower. She\r\nwould have carried the answers to him inside her stays,--and have\r\nmade long journeys down into northern parts without any money, if the\r\ncause required it. She would have liked to have around her ardent\r\nspirits, male or female, who would have talked of "the cause," and\r\nhave kept alive in her some flame of political fire. As it was, she\r\nhad no cause. Her father\'s political views were very mild. Lady\r\nMacleod\'s were deadly conservative. Kate Vavasor was an aspiring\r\nRadical just now, because her brother was in the same line; but\r\nduring the year of the love-passages between George and Alice, George\r\nVavasor\'s politics had been as conservative as you please. He did not\r\nbecome a Radical till he had quarrelled with his grandfather. Now,\r\nindeed, he was possessed of very advanced views,--views with which\r\nAlice felt that she could sympathize. But what would be the use of\r\nsympathizing down in Cambridgeshire? John Grey had, so to speak, no\r\npolitics. He had decided views as to the treatment which the Roman\r\nSenate received from Augustus, and had even discussed with Alice the\r\nconduct of the Girondists at the time of Robespierre\'s triumph; but\r\nfor Manchester and its cares he had no apparent solicitude, and had\r\ndeclared to Alice that he would not accept a seat in the British\r\nHouse of Commons if it were offered to him free of expense. What\r\npolitical enthusiasm could she indulge with such a companion down in\r\nCambridgeshire?\r\n\r\nShe thought too much of all this,--and was, if I may say,\r\nover-prudent in calculating the chances of her happiness and of\r\nhis. For, to give her credit for what was her due, she was quite as\r\nanxious on the latter head as on the former. "I don\'t care for the\r\nRoman Senate," she would say to herself. "I don\'t care much for the\r\nGirondists. How am I to talk to him day after day, night after night,\r\nwhen we shall be alone together?"\r\n\r\nNo doubt her tour in Switzerland with her cousin had had some effect\r\nin making such thoughts stronger now than they had ever been. She had\r\nnot again learned to love her cousin. She was as firmly sure as ever\r\nthat she could never love him more. He had insulted her love; and\r\nthough she had forgiven him and again enrolled him among her dearest\r\nfriends, she could never again feel for him that passion which a\r\nwoman means when she acknowledges that she is in love. That, as\r\nregarded her and George Vavasor, was over. But, nevertheless, there\r\nhad been a something of romance during those days in Switzerland\r\nwhich she feared she would regret when she found herself settled\r\nat Nethercoats. She envied Kate. Kate could, as his sister, attach\r\nherself on to George\'s political career, and obtain from it all that\r\nexcitement of life which Alice desired for herself. Alice could not\r\nlove her cousin and marry him; but she felt that if she could do so\r\nwithout impropriety she would like to stick close to him like another\r\nsister, to spend her money in aiding his career in Parliament as Kate\r\nwould do, and trust herself and her career into the boat which he was\r\nto command. She did not love her cousin; but she still believed in\r\nhim,--with a faith which he certainly did not deserve.\r\n\r\nAs the two days passed over her, her mind grew more and more fixed as\r\nto its purpose. She would tell Mr. Grey that she was not fit to be his\r\nwife--and she would beg him to pardon her and to leave her. It never\r\noccurred to her that perhaps he might refuse to let her go. She felt\r\nquite sure that she would be free as soon as she had spoken the word\r\nwhich she intended to speak. If she could speak it with decision she\r\nwould be free, and to attain that decision she would school herself\r\nwith her utmost strength. At one moment she thought of telling all to\r\nher father and of begging him to break the matter to Mr. Grey; but she\r\nknew that her father would not understand her, and that he would be\r\nvery hostile to her,--saying hard, uncomfortable words, which would\r\nprobably be spared if the thing were done before he was informed. Nor\r\nwould she write to Kate, whose letters to her at this time were full\r\nof wit at the expense of Mrs. Greenow. She would tell Kate as soon as\r\nthe thing was done, but not before. That Kate would sympathize with\r\nher, she was quite certain.\r\n\r\nSo the two days passed by and the time came at which John Grey was to\r\nbe there. As the minute hand on the drawing-room clock came round to\r\nthe full hour, she felt that her heart was beating with a violence\r\nwhich she could not repress. The thing seemed to her to assume bigger\r\ndimensions than it had hitherto done. She began to be aware that she\r\nwas about to be guilty of a great iniquity, when it was too late for\r\nher to change her mind. She could not bring herself to resolve that\r\nshe would, on the moment, change her mind. She believed that she\r\ncould never pardon herself such weakness. But yet she felt herself to\r\nbe aware that her purpose was wicked. When the knock at the door was\r\nat last heard she trembled and feared that she would almost be unable\r\nto speak to him. Might it be possible that there should yet be a\r\nreprieve for her? No; it was his step on the stairs, and there he was\r\nin the room with her.\r\n\r\n"My dearest," he said, coming to her. His smile was sweet and loving\r\nas it ever was, and his voice had its usual manly, genial, loving\r\ntone. As he walked across the room Alice felt that he was a man of\r\nwhom a wife might be very proud. He was tall and very handsome, with\r\nbrown hair, with bright blue eyes, and a mouth like a god. It was the\r\nbeauty of his mouth,--beauty which comprised firmness within itself,\r\nthat made Alice afraid of him. He was still dressed in his morning\r\nclothes; but he was a man who always seemed to be well dressed. "My\r\ndearest," he said, advancing across the room, and before she knew how\r\nto stop herself or him, he had taken her in his arms and kissed her.\r\n\r\nHe did not immediately begin about the letter, but placed her upon\r\nthe sofa, seating himself by her side, and looked into her face with\r\nloving eyes,--not as though to scrutinize what might be amiss there,\r\nbut as though determined to enjoy to the full his privilege as a\r\nlover. There was no reproach at any rate in his countenance;--none as\r\nyet; nor did it seem that he thought that he had any cause for fear.\r\nThey sat in this way for a moment or two in silence, and during those\r\nmoments Alice was summoning up her courage to speak. The palpitation\r\nat her heart was already gone, and she was determined that she would\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"Though I am very glad to see you," she said, at last, "I am sorry\r\nthat my letter should have given you the trouble of this journey."\r\n\r\n"Trouble!" he said. "Nay, you ought to know that it is no trouble. I\r\nhave not enough to do down at Nethercoats to make the running up to\r\nyou at any time an unpleasant excitement. So your Swiss journey went\r\noff pleasantly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it went off very pleasantly." This she said in that tone of\r\nvoice which clearly implies that the speaker is not thinking of the\r\nwords spoken.\r\n\r\n"And Kate has now left you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; she is with her aunt, at the seaside."\r\n\r\n"So I understand;--and your cousin George?"\r\n\r\n"I never know much of George\'s movements. He may be in Town, but I\r\nhave not seen him since I came back."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is the way with friends living in London. Unless\r\ncircumstances bring them together, they are in fact further apart\r\nthan if they lived fifty miles asunder in the country. And he managed\r\nto get through all the trouble without losing your luggage for you\r\nvery often?"\r\n\r\n"If you were to say that we did not lose his, that would be nearer\r\nthe mark. But, John, you have come up to London in this sudden way to\r\nspeak to me about my letter to you. Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly it is so. Certainly I have."\r\n\r\n"I have thought much, since, of what I then wrote, very much,--very\r\nmuch, indeed; and I have learned to feel sure that we had better--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Alice; stop a moment, love. Do not speak hurriedly. Shall I\r\ntell you what I learned from your letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; tell me, if you think it better that you should do so."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it may be better. I learned, love, that something had been\r\nsaid or done during your journey,--or perhaps only something thought,\r\nthat had made you melancholy, and filled your mind for a while with\r\nthose unsubstantial and indefinable regrets for the past which we are\r\nall apt to feel at certain moments of our life. There are few of us\r\nwho do not encounter, now and again, some of that irrational spirit\r\nof sadness which, when over-indulged, drives men to madness and\r\nself-destruction. I used to know well what it was before I knew you;\r\nbut since I have had the hope of having you in my house, I have\r\nbanished it utterly. In that I think I have been stronger than you.\r\nDo not speak under the influence of that spirit till you have thought\r\nwhether you, too, cannot banish it."\r\n\r\n"I have tried, and it will not be banished."\r\n\r\n"Try again, Alice. It is a damned spirit, and belongs neither to\r\nheaven nor to earth. Do not say to me the words that you were about\r\nto say till you have wrestled with it manfully. I think I know what\r\nthose words were to be. If you love me, those words should not be\r\nspoken. If you do not--"\r\n\r\n"If I do not love you, I love no one upon earth."\r\n\r\n"I believe it. I believe it as I believe in my own love for you. I\r\ntrust your love implicitly, Alice. I know that you love me. I think I\r\ncan read your mind. Tell me that I may return to Cambridgeshire, and\r\nagain plead my cause for an early marriage from thence. I will not\r\ntake such speech from you to mean more than it says!"\r\n\r\nShe sat quiet, looking at him--looking full into his face. She had in\r\nnowise changed her mind, but after such words from him, she did not\r\nknow how to declare to him her resolution. There was something in his\r\nmanner that awed her,--and something also that softened her.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," said he, "that I may see you again to-morrow morning in\r\nour usual quiet, loving way, and that I may return home to-morrow\r\nevening. Pronounce a yea to that speech from me, and I will ask for\r\nnothing further."\r\n\r\n"No; I cannot do so," she said. And the tone of her voice, as she\r\nspoke, was different to any tone that he had heard before from her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n"Is that melancholy fiend too strong for you?" He smiled as he said\r\nthis, and as he smiled, he took her hand. She did not attempt to\r\nwithdraw it, but sat by him in a strange calmness, looking straight\r\nbefore her into the middle of the room. "You have not struggled with\r\nit. You know, as I do, that it is a bad fiend and a wicked one,--a\r\nfiend that is prompting you to the worst cruelty in the world. Alice!\r\nAlice! Alice! Try to think of all this as though some other person\r\nwere concerned. If it were your friend, what advice would you give\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "If it were your friend, what advice would you give\r\nher?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I would bid her tell the man who had loved her,--that is, if he were\r\nnoble, good, and great,--that she found herself to be unfit to be his\r\nwife; and then I would bid her ask his pardon humbly on her knees."\r\nAs she said this, she sank before him on to the floor, and looked up\r\ninto his face with an expression of sad contrition which almost drew\r\nhim from his purposed firmness.\r\n\r\nHe had purposed to be firm,--to yield to her in nothing, resolving\r\nto treat all that she might say as the hallucination of a sickened\r\nimagination,--as the effect of absolute want of health, for which\r\nsome change in her mode of life would be the best cure. She might\r\nbid him begone in what language she would. He knew well that such\r\nwas her intention. But he would not allow a word coming from her in\r\nsuch a way to disturb arrangements made for the happiness of their\r\njoint lives. As a loving husband would treat a wife, who, in some\r\nexceptionable moment of a melancholy malady, should declare herself\r\nunable to remain longer in her home, so would he treat her. As for\r\naccepting what she might say as his dismissal, he would as soon think\r\nof taking the fruit-trees from the southern wall because the sun\r\nsometimes shines from the north. He could not treat either his\r\ninterests or hers so lightly as that.\r\n\r\n"But what if he granted no such pardon, Alice? I will grant none\r\nsuch. You are my wife, my own, my dearest, my chosen one. You are all\r\nthat I value in the world, my treasure and my comfort, my earthly\r\nhappiness and my gleam of something better that is to come hereafter.\r\nDo you think that I shall let you go from me in that way? No, love.\r\nIf you are ill I will wait till your illness is gone by; and, if you\r\nwill let me, I will be your nurse."\r\n\r\n"I am not ill."\r\n\r\n"Not ill with any defined sickness. You do not shake with ague, nor\r\ndoes your head rack you with aching; but yet you may be ill. Think of\r\nwhat has passed between us. Must you not be ill when you seek to put\r\nan end to all that without any cause assigned."\r\n\r\n"You will not hear my reasons,"--she was still kneeling before him\r\nand looking up into his face.\r\n\r\n"I will hear them if you will tell me that they refer to any supposed\r\nfaults of my own."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!"\r\n\r\n"Then I will not hear them. It is for me to find out your faults, and\r\nwhen I have found out any that require complaint, I will come and\r\nmake it. Dear Alice, I wish you knew how I long for you." Then he put\r\nhis hand upon her hair, as though he would caress her.\r\n\r\nBut this she would not suffer, so she rose slowly, and stood with her\r\nhand upon the table in the middle of the room. "Mr. Grey--" she said.\r\n\r\n"If you will call me so, I shall think it only a part of your\r\nmalady."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Grey," she continued, "I can only hope that you will take me at\r\nmy word."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I will not; certainly I will not, if that would be adverse\r\nto my own interests."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of your interests; I am, indeed;--at any rate as much\r\nas of my own. I feel quite sure that I should not make you happy as\r\nyour wife,--quite sure; and feeling that, I think that I am right,\r\neven after all that has passed, to ask your forgiveness, and to beg\r\nthat our engagement may be over."\r\n\r\n"No, Alice, no; never with my consent. I cannot tell you with what\r\ncontentment I would marry you to-morrow,--to-morrow, or next month,\r\nor the month after. But if it cannot be so, then I will wait. Nothing\r\nbut your marriage with some one else would convince me."\r\n\r\n"I cannot convince you in that way," she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"You will convince me in no other. You have not spoken to your father\r\nof this as yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not as yet."\r\n\r\n"Do not do so, at any rate for the present. You will own that it\r\nmight be possible that you would have to unsay what you had said."\r\n\r\n"No; it is not possible."\r\n\r\n"Give yourself and me the chance. It can do no harm. And, Alice, I\r\nask you now for no reasons. I will not ask your reasons, or even\r\nlisten to them, because I do not believe that they will long have\r\neffect even on yourself. Do you still think of going to Cheltenham?"\r\n\r\n"I have decided nothing as yet."\r\n\r\n"If I were you, I would go. I think a change of air would be good for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you treat me as though I were partly silly, and partly insane;\r\nbut it is not so. The change you speak of should be in my nature, and\r\nin yours."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and still smiled. There was something in the\r\nimperturbed security of his manner which almost made her angry with\r\nhim. It seemed as though he assumed so great a superiority that he\r\nfelt himself able to treat any resolve of hers as the petulance of\r\na child. And though he spoke in strong language of his love, and of\r\nhis longing that she should come to him, yet he was so well able\r\nto command his feelings, that he showed no sign of grief at the\r\ncommunication she had made to him. She did not doubt his love, but\r\nshe believed him to be so much the master of his love,--as he was the\r\nmaster of everything else, that her separation from him would cause\r\nhim no uncontrollable grief. In that she utterly failed to understand\r\nhis character. Had she known him better, she might have been sure\r\nthat such a separation now would with him have carried its mark to\r\nthe grave. Should he submit to her decision, he would go home and\r\nsettle himself to his books the next day; but on no following day\r\nwould he be again capable of walking forth among his flowers with an\r\neasy heart. He was a strong, constant man, perhaps over-conscious of\r\nhis own strength; but then his strength was great. "He is perfect!"\r\nAlice had said to herself often. "Oh that he were less perfect!"\r\n\r\nHe did not stay with her long after the last word that has been\r\nrecorded. "Perhaps," he said, as for a moment he held her hand at\r\nparting, "I had better not come to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"No, no; it is better not."\r\n\r\n"I advise you not to tell your father of this, and doubtless you will\r\nthink of it before you do so. But if you do tell him, let me know\r\nthat you have done so."\r\n\r\n"Why that?"\r\n\r\n"Because in such case I also must see him. God bless you, Alice! God\r\nbless you, dearest, dearest Alice!" Then he went, and she sat there\r\non the sofa without moving, till she heard her father\'s feet as he\r\ncame up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"What, Alice, are you not in bed yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, papa."\r\n\r\n"And so John Grey has been here. He has left his stick in the hall. I\r\nshould know it among a thousand."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he has been here."\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, nothing is the matter."\r\n\r\n"He has not made himself disagreeable, has he?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. He never does anything wrong. He may defy man or\r\nwoman to find fault with him."\r\n\r\n"So that is it, is it? He is just a shade too good. Well, I have\r\nalways thought that myself. But it\'s a fault on the right side."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no fault, Papa. If there be any fault, it is not with him. But\r\nI am yawning and tired, and I will go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Is he to be here to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"No; he returns to Nethercoats early. Good night, papa."\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor, as he went up to his bedroom, felt sure that there had\r\nbeen something wrong between his daughter and her lover. "I don\'t\r\nknow how she\'ll ever put up with him," he said to himself, "he is so\r\nterribly conceited. I shall never forget how he went on about Charles\r\nKemble, and what a fool he made of himself."\r\n\r\nAlice, before she went to bed, sat down and wrote a letter to her\r\ncousin Kate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMr. George Vavasor at Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot perhaps fairly be said that George Vavasor was an\r\nunhospitable man, seeing that it was his custom to entertain his\r\nfriends occasionally at Greenwich, Richmond, or such places; and\r\nhe would now and again have a friend to dine with him at his club.\r\nBut he never gave breakfasts, dinners, or suppers under his own\r\nroof. During a short period of his wine-selling career, at which\r\ntime he had occupied handsome rooms over his place of business in\r\nNew Burlington Street, he had presided at certain feasts given to\r\ncustomers or expectant customers by the firm; but he had not found\r\nthis employment to his taste, and had soon relinquished it to one\r\nof the other partners. Since that he had lived in lodgings in Cecil\r\nStreet,--down at the bottom of that retired nook, near to the river\r\nand away from the Strand. Here he had simply two rooms on the first\r\nfloor, and hither his friends came to him very rarely. They came very\r\nrarely on any account. A stray man might now and then pass an hour\r\nwith him here; but on such occasions the chances were that the visit\r\nhad some reference, near or distant, to affairs of business. Eating\r\nor drinking there was never any to be found here by the most intimate\r\nof his allies. His lodgings were his private retreat, and they were\r\nso private that but few of his friends knew where he lived.\r\n\r\nAnd had it been possible he would have wished that no one should have\r\nknown his whereabouts. I am not aware that he had any special reason\r\nfor this peculiarity, or that there was anything about his mode of\r\nlife that required hiding; but he was a man who had always lived as\r\nthough secrecy in certain matters might at any time become useful\r\nto him. He had a mode of dressing himself when he went out at night\r\nthat made it almost impossible that any one should recognise him. The\r\npeople at his lodgings did not even know that he had relatives, and\r\nhis nearest relatives hardly knew that he had lodgings. Even Kate\r\nhad never been at the rooms in Cecil Street, and addressed all her\r\nletters to his place of business or his club. He was a man who would\r\nbear no inquiry into himself. If he had been out of view for a month,\r\nand his friends asked him where he had been, he always answered the\r\nquestion falsely, or left it unanswered. There are many men of whom\r\neverybody knows all about all their belongings;--as to whom everybody\r\nknows where they live, whither they go, what is their means, and how\r\nthey spend it. But there are others of whom no man knows anything,\r\nand George Vavasor was such a one. For myself I like the open babbler\r\nthe best. Babbling may be a weakness, but to my thinking mystery is a\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nVavasor also maintained another little establishment, down in\r\nOxfordshire; but the two establishments did not even know of each\r\nother\'s existence. There was a third, too, very closely hidden from\r\nthe world\'s eye, which shall be nameless; but of the establishment in\r\nOxfordshire he did sometimes speak, in very humble words, among his\r\nfriends. When he found himself among hunting men, he would speak of\r\nhis two nags at Roebury, saying that he had never yet been able to\r\nmount a regular hunting stable, and that he supposed he never would;\r\nbut that there were at Roebury two indifferent beasts of his if any\r\none chose to buy them. And men very often did buy Vavasor\'s horses.\r\nWhen he was on them they always went well and sold themselves\r\nreadily. And though he thus spoke of two, and perhaps did not keep\r\nmore during the summer, he always seemed to have horses enough when\r\nhe was down in the country. No one even knew George Vavasor not to\r\nhunt because he was short of stuff. And here, at Roebury, he kept\r\na trusty servant, an ancient groom with two little bushy grey eyes\r\nwhich looked as though they could see through a stable door. Many\r\nwere the long whisperings which George and Bat Smithers carried on\r\nat the stable door, in the very back depth of the yard attached to\r\nthe hunting inn at Roebury. Bat regarded his master as a man wholly\r\ndevoted to horses, but often wondered why he was not more regular in\r\nhis sojournings in Oxfordshire. Of any other portion of his master\'s\r\nlife Bat knew nothing. Bat could give the address of his master\'s\r\nclub in London, but he could give no other address.\r\n\r\nBut though Vavasor\'s private lodgings were so very private, he had,\r\nnevertheless, taken some trouble in adorning them. The furniture in\r\nthe sitting-room was very neat, and the book-shelves were filled\r\nwith volumes that shone with gilding on their backs. The inkstand,\r\nthe paper-weight, the envelope case on his writing-table were all\r\nhandsome. He had a single good portrait of a woman\'s head hanging on\r\none of his walls. He had a special place adapted for his pistols,\r\nothers for his foils, and again another for his whips. The room was\r\nas pretty a bachelor\'s room as you would wish to enter, but you\r\nmight see, by the position of the single easy-chair that was brought\r\nforward, that it was seldom appropriated to the comfort of more than\r\none person. Here he sat lounging over his breakfast, late on a Sunday\r\nmorning in September, when all the world was out of town. He was\r\nreading a letter which had just been brought down to him from his\r\nclub. Though the writer of it was his sister Kate, she had not been\r\nprivileged to address it to his private lodgings. He read it very\r\nquickly, running rapidly over its contents, and then threw it aside\r\nfrom him as though it were of no moment, keeping, however, an\r\nenclosure in his hand. And yet the letter was of much moment, and\r\nmade him think deeply. "If I did it at all," said he, "it would be\r\nmore with the object of cutting him out than with any other."\r\n\r\nThe reader will hardly require to be told that the him in question\r\nwas John Grey, and that Kate\'s letter was one instigating her brother\r\nto renew his love affair with Alice. And Vavasor was in truth well\r\ninclined to renew it, and would have begun the renewing it at once,\r\nhad he not doubted his power with his cousin. Indeed it has been seen\r\nthat he had already attempted some commencement of such renewal at\r\nBasle. He had told Kate more than once that Alice\'s fortune was not\r\nmuch, and that her beauty was past its prime; and he would no doubt\r\nrepeat the same objections to his sister with some pretence of\r\ndisinclination. It was not his custom to show his hand to the players\r\nat any game that he played. But he was, in truth, very anxious to\r\nobtain from Alice a second promise of her hand. How soon after that\r\nhe might marry her, would be another question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not Alice\'s beauty that he coveted, nor yet her money\r\nexclusively. Nevertheless he thought her very beautiful, and was\r\nfully aware that her money would be of great service to him. But I\r\nbelieve that he was true in that word that he spoke to himself, and\r\nthat his chief attraction was the delight which he would have in\r\nrobbing Mr. Grey of his wife. Alice had once been his love, had\r\nclung to his side, had whispered love to him, and he had enough of\r\nthe weakness of humanity in him to feel the soreness arising from\r\nher affection for another. When she broke away from him he had\r\nacknowledged that he had been wrong, and when, since her engagement\r\nwith Mr. Grey, he had congratulated her, he had told her in his quiet,\r\nhalf-whispered, impressive words how right she was; but not the less,\r\ntherefore, did he feel himself hurt that John Grey should be her\r\nlover. And when he had met this man he had spoken well of him to\r\nhis sister, saying that he was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man\r\nof parts; but not the less had he hated him from the first moment\r\nof his seeing him. Such hatred under such circumstances was almost\r\npardonable. But George Vavasor, when he hated, was apt to follow up\r\nhis hatred with injury. He could not violently dislike a man and yet\r\nnot wish to do him any harm. At present, as he sat lounging in his\r\nchair, he thought that he would like to marry his cousin Alice; but\r\nhe was quite sure that he would like to be the means of putting a\r\nstop to the proposed marriage between Alice and John Grey.\r\n\r\nKate had been very false to her friend, and had sent up to her\r\nbrother the very letter which Alice had written to her after that\r\nmeeting in Queen Anne Street which was described in the last\r\nchapter,--or rather a portion of it, for with the reserve common to\r\nwomen she had kept back the other half. Alice had declared to herself\r\nthat she would be sure of her cousin\'s sympathy, and had written out\r\nall her heart on the matter, as was her wont when writing to Kate.\r\n"But you must understand," she wrote, "that all that I said to him\r\nwent with him for nothing. I had determined to make him know that\r\neverything between us must be over, but I failed. I found that I had\r\nno words at command, but that he was able to talk to me as though I\r\nwere a child. He told me that I was sick and full of phantasies, and\r\nbade me change the air. As he spoke in this way, I could not help\r\nfeeling how right he was to use me so; but I felt also that he,\r\nin his mighty superiority, could never be a fitting husband for a\r\ncreature so inferior to him as I am. Though I altogether failed\r\nto make him understand that it was so, every moment that we were\r\ntogether made me more fixed in my resolution."\r\n\r\nThis letter from Alice to Kate, Vavasor read over and over again,\r\nthough Kate\'s letter to himself, which was the longer one, he had\r\nthrown aside after the first glance. There was nothing that he could\r\nlearn from that. He was as good a judge of the manner in which he\r\nwould play his own game as Kate could be; but in this matter he was\r\nto learn how he would play his game from a knowledge of the other\r\ngirl\'s mind. "She\'ll never marry him, at any rate," he said to\r\nhimself, "and she is right. He\'d make an upper servant of her; very\r\nrespectable, no doubt, but still only an upper servant. Now with\r\nme;--well, I hardly know what I should make of her. I cannot think of\r\nmyself as a man married." Then he threw her letter after Kate\'s, and\r\nbetook himself to his newspaper and his cigar.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours after this, and he still wore his dressing-gown, and\r\nhe was still lounging in his easy-chair, when the waiting-maid at\r\nthe lodgings brought him up word that a gentleman wished to see him.\r\nVavasor kept no servant of his own except that confidential groom\r\ndown at Bicester. It was a rule with him that people could be better\r\nserved and cheaper served by other people\'s servants than by their\r\nown. Even in the stables at Bicester the innkeeper had to find what\r\nassistance was wanted, and charge for it in the bill. And George\r\nVavasor was no Sybarite. He did not deem it impracticable to put on\r\nhis own trousers without having a man standing at his foot to hold up\r\nthe leg of the garment. A valet about a man knows a great deal of a\r\nman\'s ways, and therefore George had no valet.\r\n\r\n"A gentleman!" said he to the girl. "Does the gentleman look like a\r\npublic-house keeper?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think he do," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"Then show him up," said George.\r\n\r\nAnd the gentleman was a public-house keeper. Vavasor was pretty sure\r\nof his visitor before he desired the servant to give him entrance.\r\nIt was Mr. Grimes from the "Handsome Man" public-house and tavern, in\r\nthe Brompton Road, and he had come by appointment to have a little\r\nconversation with Mr. Vavasor on matters political. Mr. Grimes was\r\na man who knew that business was business, and as such had some\r\nconsiderable weight in his own neighbourhood. With him politics was\r\nbusiness, as well as beer, and omnibus-horses, and foreign wines;--in\r\nthe fabrication of which latter article Mr. Grimes was supposed\r\nto have an extended experience. To such as him, when intent on\r\nbusiness, Mr. Vavasor was not averse to make known the secrets of his\r\nlodging-house; and now, when the idle of London world was either at\r\nmorning church or still in bed, Mr. Grimes had come out by appointment\r\nto do a little political business with the lately-rejected member for\r\nthe Chelsea Districts.\r\n\r\nVavasor had been, as I have said, lately rejected, and the new member\r\nwho had beaten him at the hustings had sat now for one session in\r\nparliament. Under his present reign he was destined to the honour of\r\none other session, and then the period of his existing glory,--for\r\nwhich he was said to have paid nearly six thousand pounds,--would be\r\nover. But he might be elected again, perhaps for a full period of six\r\nsessions; and it might be hoped that this second election would be\r\nconducted on more economical principles. To this, the economical view\r\nof the matter, Mr. Grimes was very much opposed, and was now waiting\r\nupon George Vavasor in Cecil Street, chiefly with the object of\r\nopposing the new member\'s wishes on this head. No doubt Mr. Grimes was\r\npersonally an advocate for the return of Mr. Vavasor, and would do all\r\nin his power to prevent the re-election of the young Lord Kilfenora,\r\nwhose father, the Marquis of Bunratty, had scattered that six\r\nthousand pounds among the electors and non-electors of Chelsea; but\r\nhis main object was that money should be spent. "\'Tain\'t altogether\r\nfor myself," he said to a confidential friend in the same way of\r\nbusiness; "I don\'t get so much on it. Perhaps sometimes not none. May\r\nbe I\'ve a bill agin some of those gents not paid this werry moment.\r\nBut it\'s the game I looks to. If the game dies away, it\'ll never be\r\ngot up again;--never. Who\'ll care about elections then? Anybody\'d go\r\nand get hisself elected if we was to let the game go by!" And so,\r\nthat the game might not go by, Mr. Grimes was now present in Mr. George\r\nVavasor\'s rooms.\r\n\r\n"Well Mr. Grimes," said George, "how are you this morning? Sit down,\r\nMr. Grimes. If every man were as punctual as you are, the world would\r\ngo like clock-work; wouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Business is business, Mr. Vavasor," said the publican, after having\r\nmade his salute, and having taken his chair with some little show of\r\nmock modesty. "That\'s my maxim. If I didn\'t stick to that, nothing\r\nwouldn\'t ever stick to me; and nothing doesn\'t much as it is. Times\r\nis very bad, Mr. Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"Of course they are. They\'re always bad. What was the Devil made\r\nfor, except that they should be bad? But I should have thought you\r\npublicans were the last men who ought to complain."\r\n\r\n"Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor; why, I suppose of all the men as is put\r\nupon, we\'re put upon the worst. What\'s the good of drawing of beer,\r\nif the more you draw the more you don\'t make. Yesterday as ever was\r\nwas Saturday, and we drawed three pound ten and nine. What\'ll that\r\ncome to, Mr. Vavasor, when you reckons it up with the brewer? Why,\r\nit\'s a next to nothing. You knows that well enough."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t. But I know you don\'t sell a pint of beer\r\nwithout getting a profit out of it."\r\n\r\n"Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor. If I hadn\'t nothink to look to but beer I\r\ncouldn\'t keep a house over my head; no I couldn\'t. That house of mine\r\nbelongs to Meux\'s people; and very good people they are too;--have\r\nmade a sight of money; haven\'t they, Mr. Vavasor? I has to get my beer\r\nfrom them in course. Why not, when it\'s their house? But if I sells\r\ntheir stuff as I gets it, there ain\'t a halfpenny coming to me out of\r\na gallon. Look at that, now."\r\n\r\n"But then you don\'t sell it as you get it. You stretch it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s in course. I\'m not going to tell you a lie, Mr. Vavasor. You\r\nknow what\'s what as well as I do, and a sight better, I expect.\r\nThere\'s a dozen different ways of handling beer, Mr. Vavasor. But\r\nwhat\'s the use of that, when they can take four or five pounds a day\r\nover the counter for their rot-gut stuff at the \'Cadogan Arms,\' and I\r\ncan\'t do no better nor yet perhaps so well, for a real honest glass\r\nof beer. Stretch it! It\'s my belief the more you poison their liquor,\r\nthe more the people likes it!"\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes was a stout man, not very tall, with a mottled red face,\r\nand large protruding eyes. As regards his own person, Mr. Grimes\r\nmight have been taken as a fair sample of the English innkeeper,\r\nas described for many years past. But in his outer garments he was\r\nvery unlike that description. He wore a black, swallow-tailed coat,\r\nmade, however, to set very loose upon his back, a black waistcoat,\r\nand black pantaloons. He carried, moreover, in his hands a black\r\nchimney-pot hat. Not only have the top-boots and breeches vanished\r\nfrom the costume of innkeepers, but also the long, particoloured\r\nwaistcoat, and the birds\'-eye fogle round their necks. They get\r\nthemselves up to look like Dissenting ministers or undertakers,\r\nexcept that there is still a something about their rosy gills which\r\ntells a tale of the spigot and corkscrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes had only just finished the tale of his own hard ways as a\r\npublican, when the door-bell was again rung. "There\'s Scruby," said\r\nGeorge Vavasor, "and now we can go to business."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes Gets His Odd Money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden at George Vavasor\'s lodgings announced "another gent,"\r\nand then Mr. Scruby entered the room in which were seated George, and\r\nMr. Grimes the publican from the "Handsome Man" on the Brompton Road.\r\nMr. Scruby was an attorney from Great Marlborough Street, supposed to\r\nbe very knowing in the ways of metropolitan elections; and he had now\r\nstepped round, as he called it, with the object of saying a few words\r\nto Mr. Grimes, partly on the subject of the forthcoming contest at\r\nChelsea, and partly on that of the contest last past. These words\r\nwere to be said in the presence of Mr. Vavasor, the person interested.\r\nThat some other words had been spoken between Mr. Scruby and Mr. Grimes\r\non the same subjects behind Mr. Vavasor\'s back I think very probable.\r\nBut even though this might have been so I am not prepared to say that\r\nMr. Vavasor had been deceived by their combinations.\r\n\r\nThe two men were very civil to each other in their salutations, the\r\nattorney assuming an air of patronizing condescension, always calling\r\nthe other Grimes; whereas Mr. Scruby was treated with considerable\r\ndeference by the publican, and was always called Mr. Scruby. "Business\r\nis business," said the publican as soon as these salutations were\r\nover; "isn\'t it now, Mr. Scruby?"\r\n\r\n"And I suppose Grimes thinks Sunday morning a particularly good time\r\nfor business," said the attorney, laughing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quiet, you know," said Grimes. "But it warn\'t me as named\r\nSunday morning. It was Mr. Vavasor here. But it is quiet; ain\'t it,\r\nMr. Scruby?"\r\n\r\nMr. Scruby acknowledged that it was quiet, especially looking out\r\nover the river, and then they proceeded to business. "We must pull\r\nthe governor through better next time than we did last," said the\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\n"Of course we must, Mr. Scruby; but, Lord love you, Mr. Vavasor,\r\nwhose fault was it? What notice did I get,--just tell me that? Why,\r\nTravers\'s name was up on the liberal interest ever so long before the\r\ngovernor had ever thought about it."\r\n\r\n"Nobody is blaming you, Mr. Grimes," said George.\r\n\r\n"And nobody can\'t, Mr. Vavasor. I done my work true as steel, and\r\nthere ain\'t another man about the place as could have done half\r\nas much. You ask Mr. Scruby else. Mr. Scruby knows, if ere a man in\r\nLondon does. I tell you what it is, Mr. Vavasor, them Chelsea fellows,\r\nwho lives mostly down by the river, ain\'t like your Maryboners or\r\nFinsburyites. It wants something of a man to manage them. Don\'t it Mr.\r\nScruby?"\r\n\r\n"It wants something of a man to manage any of them as far as my\r\nexperience goes," said Mr. Scruby.\r\n\r\n"Of course it do; and there ain\'t one in London knows so much about\r\nit as you do, Mr. Scruby. I will say that for you. But the long and\r\nthe short of it is this;--business is business, and money is money."\r\n\r\n"Money is money, certainly," said Mr. Scruby. "There\'s no doubt in the\r\nworld about that, Grimes;--and a deal of it you had out of the last\r\nelection."\r\n\r\n"No, I hadn\'t; begging your pardon, Mr. Scruby, for making so free.\r\nWhat I had to my own cheek wasn\'t nothing to speak of. I wasn\'t paid\r\nfor my time; that\'s what I wasn\'t. You look how a publican\'s business\r\ngets cut up at them elections;--and then the state of the house\r\nafterwards! What would the governor say to me if I was to put down\r\npainting inside and out in my little bill?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t seem to make much difference how you put it down," said\r\nVavasor. "The total is what I look at."\r\n\r\n"Just so, Mr. Vavasor; just so. The total is what I looks at too. And\r\nI has to look at it a deuced long time before I gets it. I ain\'t a\r\ngot it yet; have I, Mr. Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"Well; if you ask me I should say you had," said George. "I know I\r\npaid Mr. Scruby three hundred pounds on your account."\r\n\r\n"And I got every shilling of it, Mr. Vavasor. I\'m not a going to deny\r\nthe money, Mr. Vavasor. You\'ll never find me doing that. I\'m as round\r\nas your hat, and as square as your elbow,--I am. Mr. Scruby knows me;\r\ndon\'t you, Mr. Scruby?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I know you too well, Grimes."\r\n\r\n"No you don\'t, Mr. Scruby; not a bit too well. Nor I don\'t know you\r\ntoo well, either. I respect you, Mr. Scruby, because you\'re a man as\r\nunderstands your business. But as I was saying, what\'s three hundred\r\npounds when a man\'s bill is three hundred and ninety-two thirteen and\r\nfourpence?"\r\n\r\n"I thought that was all settled, Mr. Scruby," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"Why you see, Mr. Vavasor, it\'s very hard to settle these things. If\r\nyou ask me whether Mr. Grimes here can sue you for the balance, I tell\r\nyou very plainly that he can\'t. We were a little short of money when\r\nwe came to a settlement, as is generally the case at such times, and\r\nso we took Mr. Grimes\' receipt for three hundred pounds."\r\n\r\n"Of course you did, Mr. Scruby."\r\n\r\n"Not on account, but in full of all demands."\r\n\r\n"Now Mr. Scruby!" and the publican as he made this appeal looked at\r\nthe attorney with an expression of countenance which was absolutely\r\neloquent. "Are you going to put me off with such an excuse as that?"\r\nso the look spoke plainly enough. "Are you going to bring up my own\r\nsignature against me, when you know very well that I shouldn\'t have\r\ngot a shilling at all for the next twelve months if I hadn\'t given\r\nit? Oh Mr. Scruby!" That\'s what Mr. Grimes\' look said, and both Mr.\r\nScruby and Mr. Vavasor understood it perfectly.\r\n\r\n"In full of all demands," said Mr. Scruby, with a slight tone of\r\ntriumph in his voice, as though to show that Grimes\' appeal had no\r\neffect at all upon his conscience. "If you were to go into a court\r\nof law, Grimes, you wouldn\'t have a leg to stand upon."\r\n\r\n"A court of law? Who\'s a going to law with the governor, I should\r\nlike to know? not I; not if he didn\'t pay me them ninety-two pounds\r\nthirteen and fourpence for the next five years."\r\n\r\n"Five years or fifteen would make no difference," said Scruby. "You\r\ncouldn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t a going to try. That\'s not the ticket I\'ve come here\r\nabout, Mr. Vavasor, this blessed Sunday morning. Going to law, indeed!\r\nBut Mr. Scruby, I\'ve got a family."\r\n\r\n"Not in the vale of Taunton, I hope," said George.\r\n\r\n"They is at the \'Handsome Man\' in the Brompton Road, Mr. Vavasor; and\r\nI always feels that I owes my first duty to them. If a man don\'t work\r\nfor his family, what do he work for?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Grimes," said Mr. Scruby. "What is it you\'re at? Out with\r\nit, and don\'t keep us here all day."\r\n\r\n"What is it I\'m at, Mr. Scruby? As if you didn\'t know very well\r\nwhat I\'m at. There\'s my house;--in all them Chelsea districts it\'s\r\nthe most convenientest of any public as is open for all manner of\r\nelection purposes. That\'s given up to it."\r\n\r\n"And what next?" said Scruby.\r\n\r\n"The next is, I myself. There isn\'t one of the lot of \'em can work\r\nthem Chelsea fellows down along the river unless it is me. Mr. Scruby\r\nknows that. Why I\'ve been a getting of them up with a view to this\r\nvery job ever since;--why ever since they was a talking of the\r\nChelsea districts. When Lord Robert was a coming in for the county\r\non the religious dodge, he couldn\'t have worked them fellows anyhow,\r\nonly for me. Mr. Scruby knows that."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take it all for granted, Mr. Grimes," said Vavasor. "What comes\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--them Bunratty people; it is they as has come next. They know\r\nwhich side their bread is likely to be buttered; they do. They\'re a\r\nbidding for the \'Handsome Man\' already; they are."\r\n\r\n"And you\'d let your house to the Tory party, Grimes!" said Mr. Scruby,\r\nin a tone in which disgust and anger were blended.\r\n\r\n"Who said anything of my letting my house to the Tory party, Mr.\r\nScruby? I\'m as round as your hat, Mr. Scruby, and as square as your\r\nelbow; I am. But suppose as all the liberal gents as employs you,\r\nMr. Scruby, was to turn again you and not pay you your little bills,\r\nwouldn\'t you have your eyes open for customers of another kind? Come\r\nnow, Mr. Scruby?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I\'m as round as your hat, and as square as your\r\nelbow; I am."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"You won\'t make much of that game, Grimes."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; perhaps not. There\'s a risk in all these things; isn\'t\r\nthere, Mr. Vavasor? I should like to see you a Parliament gent; I\r\nshould indeed. You\'d be a credit to the districts; I really think you\r\nwould."\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged by your good opinion, Mr. Grimes," said George.\r\n\r\n"When I sees a gent coming forward I knows whether he\'s fit for\r\nParliament, or whether he ain\'t. I says you are fit. But Lord love\r\nyou, Mr. Vavasor; it\'s a thing a gentleman always has to pay for."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough; a deal more than it\'s worth, generally."\r\n\r\n"A thing\'s worth what it fetches. I\'m worth what I\'ll fetch; that\'s\r\nthe long and the short of it. I want to have my balance, that\'s the\r\ntruth. It\'s the odd money in a man\'s bill as always carries the\r\nprofit. You ask Mr. Scruby else;--only with a lawyer it\'s all profit I\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you know about it," said Scruby.\r\n\r\n"If you cut off a man\'s odd money," continued the publican, "you\r\nbreak his heart. He\'d almost sooner have that and leave the other\r\nstanding. He\'d call the hundreds capital, and if he lost them at\r\nlast, why he\'d put it down as being in the way of trade. But the odd\r\nmoney;--he looks at that, Mr. Vavasor, as in a manner the very sweat\r\nof his brow, the work of his own hand; that\'s what goes to his\r\nfamily, and keeps the pot a boiling down-stairs. Never stop a man\'s\r\nodd money, Mr. Vavasor; that is, unless he comes it very strong\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"And what is it you want now?" said Scruby.\r\n\r\n"I wants ninety-two pounds thirteen and fourpence, Mr. Scruby, and\r\nthen we\'ll go to work for the new fight with contented hearts. If\r\nwe\'re to begin at all, it\'s quite time; it is indeed, Mr. Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"And what you mean us to understand is, that you won\'t begin at all\r\nwithout your money," said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, Mr. Scruby."\r\n\r\n"Take a fifty-pound note, Grimes," said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"Fifty-pound notes are not so ready," said George.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'ll be only too happy to have your acceptance; won\'t you,\r\nGrimes."\r\n\r\n"Not for fifty pounds, Mr. Scruby. It\'s the odd money that I wants.\r\nI don\'t mind the thirteen and four, because that\'s neither here nor\r\nthere among friends, but if I didn\'t get all them ninety-two pounds\r\nI should be a broken-hearted man; I should indeed, Mr. Vavasor. I\r\ncouldn\'t go about your work for next year so as to do you justice\r\namong the electors. I couldn\'t indeed."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better give him a bill for ninety pounds at three months, Mr.\r\nVavasor. I have no doubt he has got a stamp in his pocket."\r\n\r\n"That I have, Mr. Scruby; there ain\'t no mistake about that. A bill\r\nstamp is a thing that often turns up convenient with gents as mean\r\nbusiness like Mr. Vavasor and you. But you must make it ninety-two;\r\nyou must indeed, Mr. Vavasor. And do make it two months if you can,\r\nMr. Vavasor; they do charge so unconscionable on ninety days at them\r\nbranch banks; they do indeed."\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor and Mr. Scruby, between them, yielded at last, so far\r\nas to allow the bill to be drawn for ninety-two pounds, but they were\r\nstanch as to the time. "If it must be, it must," said the publican,\r\nwith a deep sigh, as he folded up the paper and put it into the\r\npocket of a huge case which he carried. "And now, gents, I\'ll tell\r\nyou what it is. We\'ll make safe work of this here next election. We\r\nknow what\'s to be our little game in time, and if we don\'t go in and\r\nwin, my name ain\'t Jacob Grimes, and I ain\'t the landlord of the\r\n\'Handsome Man.\' As you gents has perhaps got something to say among\r\nyourselves, I\'ll make so bold as to wish you good morning." So, with\r\nthat, Mr. Grimes lifted his hat from the floor, and bowed himself out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t have done it cheaper; you couldn\'t, indeed," said the\r\nlawyer, as soon as the sound of the closing front door had been\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; but what a thief the man is! I remember your telling me\r\nthat the bill was about the most preposterous you had ever seen."\r\n\r\n"So it was, and if we hadn\'t wanted him again of course we shouldn\'t\r\nhave paid him. But we\'ll have it all off his next account, Mr.\r\nVavasor,--every shilling of it, It\'s only lent; that\'s all;--it\'s\r\nonly lent."\r\n\r\n"But one doesn\'t want to lend such a man money, if one could help\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. If you look at it in that light, it\'s quite true. But\r\nyou see we cannot do without him. If he hadn\'t got your bill, he\'d\r\nhave gone over to the other fellows before the week was over; and the\r\nworst of it would have been that he knows our hand. Looking at it all\r\nround you\'ve got him cheap, Mr. Vavasor;--you have, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Looking at it all round is just what I don\'t like, Mr. Scruby, But if\r\na man will have a whistle, he must pay for it."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do it cheap for any of these metropolitan seats; you\r\ncan\'t, indeed, Mr. Vavasor. That is, a new man can\'t. When you\'ve\r\nbeen in four or five times, like old Duncombe, why then, of course,\r\nyou may snap your fingers at such men as Grimes. But the Chelsea\r\ndistricts ain\'t dear. I don\'t call them by any means dear. Now\r\nMarylebone is dear,--and so is Southwark. It\'s dear, and nasty;\r\nthat\'s what the borough is. Only that I never tell tales, I could\r\ntell you a tale, Mr. Vavasor, that\'d make your hair stand on end; I\r\ncould indeed."\r\n\r\n"Ah! the game is hardly worth the candle, I believe."\r\n\r\n"That depends on what way you choose to look at it. A seat in\r\nParliament is a great thing to a man who wants to make his way;--a\r\nvery great thing;--specially when a man\'s young, like you, Mr.\r\nVavasor."\r\n\r\n"Young!" said George. "Sometimes it seems to me as though I\'ve been\r\nliving for a hundred years. But I won\'t trouble you with that, Mr.\r\nScruby, and I believe I needn\'t keep you any longer." With that, he\r\ngot up and bowed the attorney out of the room, with just a little\r\nmore ceremony than he had shown to the publican.\r\n\r\n"Young!" said Vavasor to himself, when he was left alone. "There\'s\r\nmy uncle, or the old squire,--they\'re both younger men than I am.\r\nOne cares for his dinner, and the other for his bullocks and his\r\ntrees. But what is there that I care for, unless it is not getting\r\namong the sheriff\'s officers for debt?" Then he took out a little\r\nmemorandum-book from his breast-pocket, and having made in it an\r\nentry as to the amount and date of that bill which he had just\r\naccepted on the publican\'s behalf, he conned over the particulars of\r\nits pages. "Very blue; very blue, indeed," he said to himself when he\r\nhad completed the study. "But nobody shall say I hadn\'t the courage\r\nto play the game out, and that old fellow must die some day, one\r\nsupposes. If I were not a fool, I should make it up with him before\r\nhe went; but I am a fool, and shall remain so to the last." Soon\r\nafter that he dressed himself slowly, reading a little every now and\r\nthen as he did so. When his toilet was completed, and his Sunday\r\nnewspapers sufficiently perused, he took up his hat and umbrella and\r\nsauntered out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor Becomes Troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Vavasor had sent to her brother only the first half of her\r\ncousin\'s letter, that half in which Alice had attempted to describe\r\nwhat had taken place between her and Mr. Grey. In doing this, Kate\r\nhad been a wicked traitor,--a traitor to that feminine faith against\r\nwhich treason on the part of one woman is always unpardonable in\r\nthe eyes of other women. But her treason would have been of a deeper\r\ndie had she sent the latter portion, for in that Alice had spoken\r\nof George Vavasor himself. But even of this treason, Kate would, I\r\nthink, have been guilty, had the words which Alice wrote been of a\r\nnature to serve her own purpose if read by her brother. But they had\r\nnot been of this nature. They had spoken of George as a man with\r\nwhom any closer connection than that which existed at present was\r\nimpossible, and had been written with the view of begging Kate to\r\ndesist from making futile attempts in that direction. "I feel myself\r\ndriven," Alice had said, "to write all this, as otherwise,--if I were\r\nsimply to tell you that I have resolved to part from Mr. Grey,--you\r\nwould think that the other thing might follow. The other thing cannot\r\nfollow. I should think myself untrue in my friendship to you if I did\r\nnot tell you about Mr. Grey; and you will be untrue in your friendship\r\nto me if you take advantage of my confidence by saying more about\r\nyour brother." This part of Alice\'s letter Kate had not sent to\r\nGeorge Vavasor;--"But the other thing shall follow," Kate had said,\r\nas she read the words for the second time, and then put the papers\r\ninto her desk. "It shall follow."\r\n\r\nTo give Kate Vavasor her due, she was, at any rate, unselfish in\r\nher intrigues. She was obstinately persistent, and she was moreover\r\nunscrupulous, but she was not selfish. Many years ago she had made\r\nup her mind that George and Alice should be man and wife, feeling\r\nthat such a marriage would be good at any rate for her brother. It\r\nhad been almost brought about, and had then been hindered altogether\r\nthrough a fault on her brother\'s part. But she had forgiven him this\r\nsin as she had forgiven many others, and she was now at work in\r\nhis behalf again, determined that they two should be married, even\r\nthough neither of them might be now anxious that it should be so. The\r\nintrigue itself was dear to her, and success in it was necessary to\r\nher self-respect.\r\n\r\nShe answered Alice\'s letter with a pleasant, gossiping epistle, which\r\nshall be recorded, as it will tell us something of Mrs. Greenow\'s\r\nproceedings at Yarmouth. Kate had promised to stay at Yarmouth for a\r\nmonth, but she had already been there six weeks, and was still under\r\nher aunt\'s wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Yarmouth, October, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST ALICE,\r\n\r\n   Of course I am delighted. It is no good saying that I am\r\n   not. I know how difficult it is to deal with you, and\r\n   therefore I sit down to answer your letter with fear and\r\n   trembling, lest I should say a word too much, and thereby\r\n   drive you back, or not say quite enough and thereby fail\r\n   to encourage you on. Of course I am glad. I have long\r\n   thought that Mr. Grey could not make you happy, and as\r\n   I have thought so, how can I not be glad? It is no use\r\n   saying that he is good and noble, and all that sort of\r\n   thing. I have never denied it. But he was not suited to\r\n   you, and his life would have made you wretched. Ergo, I\r\n   rejoice. And as you are the dearest friend I have, of\r\n   course I rejoice mightily.\r\n\r\n   I can understand accurately the sort of way in which\r\n   the interview went. Of course he had the best of it.\r\n   I can see him so plainly as he stood up in unruffled\r\n   self-possession, ignoring all that you said, suggesting\r\n   that you were feverish or perhaps bilious, waving his\r\n   hand over you a little, as though that might possibly do\r\n   you some small good, and then taking his leave with an\r\n   assurance that it would be all right as soon as the wind\r\n   changed. I suppose it\'s very noble in him, not taking you\r\n   at your word, and giving you, as it were, another chance;\r\n   but there is a kind of nobility which is almost too great\r\n   for this world. I think very well of you, my dear, as\r\n   women go, but I do not think well enough of you to believe\r\n   that you are fit to be Mr. John Grey\'s wife.\r\n\r\n   Of course I\'m very glad. You have known my mind from the\r\n   first to the last, and, therefore, what would be the good\r\n   of my mincing matters? No woman wishes her dearest friend\r\n   to marry a man to whom she herself is antipathetic. You\r\n   would have been as much lost to me, had you become Mrs.\r\n   Grey of Nethercoats, Cambridgeshire, as though you had\r\n   gone to heaven. I don\'t say but what Nethercoats may be a\r\n   kind of heaven,--but then one doesn\'t wish one\'s friend\r\n   that distant sort of happiness. A flat Eden I can fancy\r\n   it, hemmed in by broad dykes, in which cream and eggs are\r\n   very plentiful, where an Adam and an Eve might drink the\r\n   choicest tea out of the finest china, with toast buttered\r\n   to perfection, from year\'s end to year\'s end; into which\r\n   no money troubles would ever find their way, nor yet\r\n   any naughty novels. But such an Eden is not tempting to\r\n   me, nor, as I think, to you. I can fancy you stretching\r\n   your poor neck over the dyke, longing to fly away that\r\n   you might cease to be at rest, but knowing that the\r\n   matrimonial dragon was too strong for any such flight. If\r\n   ever bird banged his wings to pieces against gilded bars,\r\n   you would have banged yours to pieces in that cage.\r\n\r\n   You say that you have failed to make him understand that\r\n   the matter is settled. I need not say that of course it is\r\n   settled, and that he must be made to understand it. You\r\n   owe it to him now to put him out of all doubt. He is, I\r\n   suppose, accessible to the words of a mortal, god though\r\n   he be. But I do not fear about this, for, after all, you\r\n   have as much firmness about you as most people;--perhaps\r\n   as much as he has at bottom, though you may not have so\r\n   many occasions to show it.\r\n\r\n   As to that other matter I can only say that you shall be\r\n   obliged, as far as it is in my power to obey you. For\r\n   what may come out from me by word of mouth when we are\r\n   together, I will not answer with certainty. But my pen is\r\n   under better control, and it shall not write the offending\r\n   name.\r\n\r\n   And now I must tell you a little about myself;--or rather,\r\n   I am inclined to spin a yarn, and tell you a great deal.\r\n   I have got such a lover! But I did describe him before.\r\n   Of course it\'s Mr. Cheesacre. If I were to say he hasn\'t\r\n   declared himself, I should hardly give you a fair idea of\r\n   my success. And yet he has not declared himself,--and,\r\n   which is worse, is very anxious to marry a rival. But it\'s\r\n   a strong point in my favour that my rival wants him to\r\n   take me, and that he will assuredly be driven to make me\r\n   an offer sooner or later, in obedience to her orders. My\r\n   aunt is my rival, and I do not feel the least doubt as to\r\n   his having offered to her half a dozen times. But then she\r\n   has another lover, Captain Bellfield, and I see that she\r\n   prefers him. He is a penniless scamp and looks as though\r\n   he drank. He paints his whiskers too, which I don\'t\r\n   like; and, being forty, tries to look like twenty-five.\r\n   Otherwise he is agreeable enough, and I rather approve of\r\n   my aunt\'s taste in preferring him.\r\n\r\n   But my lover has solid attractions, and allures me on by\r\n   a description of the fat cattle which he sends to market.\r\n   He is a man of substance, and should I ever become Mrs.\r\n   Cheesacre, I have reason to think that I shall not be left\r\n   in want. We went up to his place on a visit the other day.\r\n   Oileymead is the name of my future home;--not so pretty\r\n   as Nethercoats, is it? And we had such a time there! We\r\n   reached the place at ten and left it at four, and he\r\n   managed to give us three meals. I\'m sure we had before our\r\n   eyes at different times every bit of china, delf, glass,\r\n   and plate in the establishment. He made us go into the\r\n   cellar, and told us how much wine he had got there, and\r\n   how much beer. "It\'s all paid for, Mrs. Greenow, every\r\n   bottle of it," he said, turning round to my aunt, with a\r\n   pathetic earnestness, for which I had hardly given him\r\n   credit. "Everything in this house is my own; it\'s all paid\r\n   for. I don\'t call anything a man\'s own till it\'s paid for.\r\n   Now that jacket that Bellfield swells about with on the\r\n   sands at Yarmouth,--that\'s not his own,--and it\'s not\r\n   like to be either." And then he winked his eye as though\r\n   bidding my aunt to think of that before she encouraged\r\n   such a lover as Bellfield. He took us into every bedroom,\r\n   and disclosed to us all the glories of his upper chambers.\r\n   It would have done you good to see him lifting the\r\n   counterpanes, and bidding my aunt feel the texture of\r\n   the blankets! And then to see her turn round to me and\r\n   say:--"Kate, it\'s simply the best-furnished house I ever\r\n   went over in my life!"--"It does seem very comfortable,"\r\n   said I. "Comfortable!" said he. "Yes, I don\'t think\r\n   there\'s anybody can say that Oileymead isn\'t comfortable."\r\n   I did so think of you and Nethercoats. The attractions\r\n   are the same;--only in the one place you would have a god\r\n   for your keeper, and in the other a brute. For myself, if\r\n   ever I\'m to have a keeper at all, I shall prefer a man.\r\n   But when we got to the farmyard his eloquence reached the\r\n   highest pitch. "Mrs. Greenow," said he, "look at that," and\r\n   he pointed to heaps of manure raised like the streets of a\r\n   little city. "Look at that!" "There\'s a great deal," said\r\n   my aunt. "I believe you," said he. "I\'ve more muck upon\r\n   this place here than any farmer in Norfolk, gentle or\r\n   simple; I don\'t care who the other is." Only fancy, Alice;\r\n   it may all be mine; the blankets, the wine, the muck, and\r\n   the rest of it. So my aunt assured me when we got home\r\n   that evening. When I remarked that the wealth had been\r\n   exhibited to her and not to me, she did not affect to deny\r\n   it, but treated that as a matter of no moment. "He wants\r\n   a wife, my dear," she said, "and you may pick him up\r\n   to-morrow by putting out your hand." When I remarked that\r\n   his mind seemed to be intent on low things, and specially\r\n   named the muck, she only laughed at me. "Money\'s never\r\n   dirty," she said, "nor yet what makes money." She talks of\r\n   taking lodgings in Norwich for the winter, saying that in\r\n   her widowed state she will be as well there as anywhere\r\n   else, and she wants me to stay with her up to Christmas.\r\n   Indeed she first proposed the Norwich plan on the ground\r\n   that it might be useful to me,--with a view to Mr.\r\n   Cheesacre, of course; but I fancy that she is unwilling\r\n   to tear herself away from Captain Bellfield. At any rate\r\n   to Norwich she will go, and I have promised not to leave\r\n   her before the second week in November. With all her\r\n   absurdities I like her. Her faults are terrible faults,\r\n   but she has not the fault of hiding them by falsehood. She\r\n   is never stupid, and she is very good-natured. She would\r\n   have allowed me to equip myself from head to foot at her\r\n   expense, if I would have accepted her liberality, and\r\n   absolutely offered to give me my trousseau if I would\r\n   marry Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n   I live in the hope that you will come down to the old\r\n   place at Christmas. I won\'t offend you more than I can\r\n   help. At any rate he won\'t be there. And if I don\'t see\r\n   you there, where am I to see you? If I were you I would\r\n   certainly not go to Cheltenham. You are never happy there.\r\n\r\n   Do you ever dream of the river at Basle? I do;--so often.\r\n\r\n   Most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n   KATE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Mrs. Greenow, look at that."]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice had almost lost the sensation created by the former portion of\r\nKate\'s letter by the fun of the latter, before she had quite made\r\nthat sensation her own. The picture of the Cambridgeshire Eden would\r\nhave displeased her had she dwelt upon it, and the allusion to the\r\ncream and toast would have had the very opposite effect to that which\r\nKate had intended. Perhaps Kate had felt this, and had therefore\r\nmerged it all in her stories about Mr. Cheesacre. "I will go to\r\nCheltenham," she said to herself. "He has recommended it. I shall\r\nnever be his wife;--but, till we have parted altogether, I will show\r\nhim that I think well of his advice." That same afternoon she told\r\nher father that she would go to Lady Macleod\'s at Cheltenham before\r\nthe end of the month. She was, in truth, prompted to this by a\r\nresolution, of which she was herself hardly conscious, that she would\r\nnot at this period of her life be in any way guided by her cousin.\r\nHaving made up her mind about Mr. Grey, it was right that she should\r\nlet her cousin know her purpose; but she would never be driven to\r\nconfess to herself that Kate had influenced her in the matter. She\r\nwould go to Cheltenham. Lady Macleod would no doubt vex her by hourly\r\nsolicitations that the match might be renewed; but, if she knew\r\nherself, she had strength to withstand Lady Macleod.\r\n\r\nShe received one letter from Mr. Grey before the time came\r\nfor her departure, and she answered it, telling him of her\r\nintention;--telling him also that she now felt herself bound to\r\nexplain to her father her present position. "I tell you this," she\r\nsaid, "in consequence of what you said to me on the matter. My father\r\nwill know it to-morrow, and on the following morning I shall start\r\nfor Cheltenham. I have heard from Lady Macleod and she expects me."\r\n\r\nOn the following morning she did tell her father, standing by him as\r\nhe sat at his breakfast. "What!" said he, putting down his tea-cup\r\nand looking up into her face; "What! not marry John Grey!"\r\n\r\n"No, papa; I know how strange you must think it."\r\n\r\n"And you say that there has been no quarrel."\r\n\r\n"No;--there has been no quarrel. By degrees I have learned to feel\r\nthat I should not make him happy as his wife."\r\n\r\n"It\'s d----d nonsense," said Mr. Vavasor. Now such an expression as\r\nthis from him, addressed to his daughter, showed that he was very\r\ndeeply moved.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa! don\'t talk to me in that way."\r\n\r\n"But it is. I never heard such trash in my life. If he comes to me I\r\nshall tell him so. Not make him happy! Why can\'t you make him happy?"\r\n\r\n"We are not suited to each other."\r\n\r\n"But what\'s the matter with him? He\'s a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'s a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"And a man of honour, and with good means, and with all that\r\nknowledge and reading which you profess to like. Look here, Alice;\r\nI am not going to interfere, nor shall I attempt to make you marry\r\nanyone. You are your own mistress as far as that is concerned. But I\r\ndo hope, for your sake and for mine,--I do hope that there is nothing\r\nagain between you and your cousin."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing, papa."\r\n\r\n"I did not like your going abroad with him, though I didn\'t choose\r\nto interrupt your plan by saying so. But if there were anything of\r\nthat kind going on, I should be bound to tell you that your cousin\'s\r\nposition at present is not a good one. Men do not speak well of him."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing between us, papa; but if there were, men speaking\r\nill of him would not deter me."\r\n\r\n"And men speaking well of Mr. Grey will not do the other thing. I know\r\nvery well that women can be obstinate."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t come to this resolution without thinking much about it,\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. Well;--I can\'t say anything more. You are your own\r\nmistress, and your fortune is in your own keeping. I can\'t make you\r\nmarry John Grey. I think you very foolish, and if he comes to me I\r\nshall tell him so. You are going down to Cheltenham, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; I have promised Lady Macleod."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I\'d sooner it should be you than me; that\'s all I can\r\nsay." Then he took up his newspaper, thereby showing that he had\r\nnothing further to say on the matter, and Alice left him alone.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was so vexatious that even Mr. Vavasor was disturbed\r\nby it. As it was not term time he had no signing to do in Chancery\r\nLane, and could not, therefore, bury his unhappiness in his daily\r\nlabour,--or rather in his labour that was by no means daily. So he\r\nsat at home till four o\'clock, expressing to himself in various\r\nphrases his wonder that "any man alive should ever rear a daughter."\r\nAnd when he got to his club the waiters found him quite unmanageable\r\nabout his dinner, which he ate alone, rejecting all proposition of\r\ncompanionship. But later in the evening he regained his composure\r\nover a glass of whiskey-toddy and a cigar. "She\'s got her own money,"\r\nhe said to himself, "and what does it matter? I don\'t suppose she\'ll\r\nmarry her cousin. I don\'t think she\'s fool enough for that. And after\r\nall she\'ll probably make it up again with John Grey." And in this way\r\nhe determined that he might let this annoyance run off him, and that\r\nhe need not as a father take the trouble of any interference.\r\n\r\nBut while he was at his club there came a visitor to Queen Anne\r\nStreet, and that visitor was the dangerous cousin of whom, according\r\nto his uncle\'s testimony, men at present did not speak well. Alice\r\nhad not seen him since they had parted on the day of their arrival\r\nin London,--nor, indeed, had heard of his whereabouts. In the\r\nconsternation of her mind at this step which she was taking,--a step\r\nwhich she had taught herself to regard as essentially her duty before\r\nit was taken, but which seemed to herself to be false and treacherous\r\nthe moment she had taken it,--she had become aware that she had been\r\nwrong to travel with her cousin. She felt sure,--she thought that\r\nshe was sure,--that her doing so had in nowise affected her dealings\r\nwith Mr. Grey. She was very certain,--she thought that she was\r\ncertain,--that she would have rejected him just the same had she\r\nnever gone to Switzerland. But every one would say of her that her\r\njourney to Switzerland with such companions had produced that result.\r\nIt had been unlucky and she was sorry for it, and she now wished to\r\navoid all communication with her cousin till this affair should be\r\naltogether over. She was especially unwilling to see him; but she\r\nhad not felt it necessary to give any special injunctions as to his\r\nadmittance; and now, before she had time to think of it,--on the eve\r\nof her departure for Cheltenham,--he was in the room with her, just\r\nas the dusk of the October evening was coming on. She was sitting\r\naway from the fire, almost behind the window-curtains, thinking of\r\nJohn Grey and very unhappy in her thoughts, when George Vavasor was\r\nannounced. It will of course be understood that Vavasor had at this\r\ntime received his sister\'s letter. He had received it, and had had\r\ntime to consider the matter since the Sunday morning on which we\r\nsaw him in his own rooms in Cecil Street. "She can turn it all into\r\ncapital to-morrow, if she pleases," he had said to himself when\r\nthinking of her income. But he had also reminded himself that her\r\ngrandfather would probably enable him to settle an income out of the\r\nproperty upon Alice, in the event of their being married. And then\r\nhe had also felt that he could have no greater triumph than "walking\r\natop of John Grey," as he called it. His return for the Chelsea\r\nDistricts would hardly be sweeter to him than that.\r\n\r\n"You must have thought I had vanished out of the world," said George,\r\ncoming up to her with his extended hand.\r\n\r\nAlice was confused, and hardly knew how to address him. "Somebody\r\ntold me that you were shooting," she said after a pause.\r\n\r\n"So I was, but my shooting is not like the shooting of your great\r\nNimrods,--men who are hunters upon the earth. Two days among the\r\ngrouse and two more among the partridges are about the extent of it.\r\nCapel Court is the preserve in which I am usually to be found."\r\n\r\nAlice knew nothing of Capel Court, and said, "Oh, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Have you heard from Kate?" George asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, once or twice; she is still at Yarmouth with Aunt Greenow."\r\n\r\n"And is going to Norwich, as she says. Kate seems to have made\r\na league with Aunt Greenow. I, who don\'t pretend to be very\r\ndisinterested in money matters, think that she is quite right. No\r\ndoubt Aunt Greenow may marry again, but friends with forty thousand\r\npounds are always agreeable."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that Kate thinks much of that," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Not so much as she ought, I dare say. Poor Kate is not a rich woman,\r\nor, I fear, likely to become one. She doesn\'t seem to dream of\r\ngetting married, and her own fortune is less than a hundred a year."\r\n\r\n"Girls who never dream of getting married are just those who make the\r\nbest marriages at last," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so, but I wish I was easier about Kate. She is the best\r\nsister a man ever had."\r\n\r\n"Indeed she is."\r\n\r\n"And I have done nothing for her as yet. I did think, while I was in\r\nthat wine business, that I could have done anything I pleased for\r\nher. But my grandfather\'s obstinacy put me out of that; and now I\'m\r\nbeginning the world again,--that is, comparatively. I wonder whether\r\nyou think I\'m wrong in trying to get into Parliament?"\r\n\r\n"No; quite right. I admire you for it. It is just what I would do in\r\nyour place. You are unmarried, and have a right to run the risk."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to hear you speak like that," said he. He had now\r\nmanaged to take up that friendly, confidential, almost affectionate\r\ntone of talking which he had so often used when abroad with her, and\r\nwhich he had failed to assume when first entering the room.\r\n\r\n"I have always thought so."\r\n\r\n"But you have never said it."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I? I thought I had."\r\n\r\n"Not heartily like that. I know that people abuse me;--my own people,\r\nmy grandfather, and probably your father,--saying that I am reckless\r\nand the rest of it. I do risk everything for my object; but I do not\r\nknow that any one can blame me,--unless it be Kate. To whom else do I\r\nowe anything?"\r\n\r\n"Kate does not blame you."\r\n\r\n"No; she sympathizes with me; she, and she only, unless it be you."\r\nThen he paused for an answer, but she made him none. "She is brave\r\nenough to give me her hearty sympathy. But perhaps for that very\r\nreason I ought to be the more chary in endangering the only support\r\nthat she is like to have. What is ninety pounds a year for the\r\nmaintenance of a single lady?"\r\n\r\n"I hope that Kate will always live with me," said Alice; "that is, as\r\nsoon as she has lost her home at Vavasor Hall."\r\n\r\nHe had been very crafty and had laid a trap for her. He had laid a\r\ntrap for her, and she had fallen into it. She had determined not to\r\nbe induced to talk of herself; but he had brought the thing round so\r\ncunningly that the words were out of her mouth before she remembered\r\nwhither they would lead her. She did remember this as she was\r\nspeaking them, but then it was too late.\r\n\r\n"What;--at Nethercoats?" said he. "Neither she nor I doubt your love,\r\nbut few men would like such an intruder as that into their household,\r\nand of all men Mr. Grey, whose nature is retiring, would like it the\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of Nethercoats," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, no; that is it, you see. Kate says so often to me that when you\r\nare married she will be alone in the world."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she will ever find that I shall separate myself from\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"No; not by any will of your own. Poor Kate! You cannot be surprised\r\nthat she should think of your marriage with dread. How much of her\r\nlife has been made up of her companionship with you;--and all the\r\nbest of it too! You ought not to be angry with her for regarding your\r\nwithdrawal into Cambridgeshire with dismay."\r\n\r\nAlice could not act the lie which now seemed to be incumbent on her.\r\nShe could not let him talk of Nethercoats as though it were to be her\r\nfuture home. She made the struggle, and she found that she could not\r\ndo it. She was unable to find the words which should tell no lie to\r\nthe ear, and which should yet deceive him. "Kate may still live with\r\nme," she said slowly. "Everything is over between me and Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"Alice!--is that true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, George; it is true. If you will allow me to say so, I would\r\nrather not talk about it;--not just at present."\r\n\r\n"And does Kate know it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Kate knows it."\r\n\r\n"And my uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa knows it also."\r\n\r\n"Alice, how can I help speaking of it? How can I not tell you that I\r\nam rejoiced that you are saved from a thraldom which I have long felt\r\nsure would break your heart?"\r\n\r\n"Pray do not talk of it further."\r\n\r\n"Well; if I am forbidden I shall of course obey. But I own it is hard\r\nto me. How can I not congratulate you?" To this she answered nothing,\r\nbut beat with her foot upon the floor as though she were impatient\r\nof his words. "Yes, Alice, I understand. You are angry with me,"\r\nhe continued. "And yet you have no right to be surprised that when\r\nyou tell me this I should think of all that passed between us in\r\nSwitzerland. Surely the cousin who was with you then has a right to\r\nsay what he thinks of this change in your life; at any rate he may do\r\nso, if as in this case he approves altogether of what you are doing."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of your approval, George; but pray let that be an end to\r\nit."\r\n\r\nAfter that the two sat silent for a minute or two. She was waiting\r\nfor him to go, but she could not bid him leave the house. She was\r\nangry with herself, in that she had allowed herself to tell him\r\nof her altered plans, and she was angry with him because he would\r\nnot understand that she ought to be spared all conversation on\r\nthe subject. So she sat looking through the window at the row of\r\ngaslights as they were being lit, and he remained in his chair with\r\nhis elbow on the table and his head resting on his hand.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember asking me whether I ever shivered," he said at last;\r\n"--whether I ever thought of things that made me shiver? Don\'t you\r\nremember; on the bridge at Basle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I remember."\r\n\r\n"Well, Alice;--one cause for my shivering is over. I won\'t say more\r\nthan that now. Shall you remain long at Cheltenham?"\r\n\r\n"Just a month."\r\n\r\n"And then you come back here?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. Papa and I will probably go down to Vavasor Hall\r\nbefore Christmas. How much before I cannot say."\r\n\r\n"I shall see you at any rate after your return from Cheltenham? Of\r\ncourse Kate will know, and she will tell me."\r\n\r\n"Yes; Kate will know. I suppose she will stay here when she comes up\r\nfrom Norfolk. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Alice. I shall have fewer fits of that inward shivering\r\nthat you spoke of,--many less, on account of what I have now heard.\r\nGod bless you, Alice; good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, George."\r\n\r\nAs he went he took her hand and pressed it closely between his own.\r\nIn those days when they were lovers,--engaged lovers, a close,\r\nlong-continued pressure of her hand had been his most eloquent speech\r\nof love. He had not been given to many kisses,--not even to many\r\nwords of love. But he would take her hand and hold it, even as he\r\nlooked away from her, and she remembered well the touch of his palm.\r\nIt was ever cool,--cool, and with a surface smooth as a woman\'s,--a\r\nsmall hand that had a firm grip. There had been days when she had\r\nloved to feel that her own was within it, when she trusted in it, and\r\nintended that it should be her staff through life. Now she distrusted\r\nit; and as the thoughts of the old days came upon her, and the\r\nremembrance of that touch was recalled, she drew her hand away\r\nrapidly. Not for that had she driven from her as honest a man as had\r\never wished to mate with a woman. He, George Vavasor, had never so\r\nheld her hand since the day when they had parted, and now on this\r\nfirst occasion of her freedom she felt it again. What did he think of\r\nher? Did he suppose that she could transfer her love in that way, as\r\na flower may be taken from one buttonhole and placed in another? He\r\nread it all, and knew that he was hurrying on too quickly. "I can\r\nunderstand well," he said in a whisper, "what your present feelings\r\nare; but I do not think you will be really angry with me because I\r\nhave been unable to repress my joy at what I cannot but regard as\r\nyour release from a great misfortune." Then he went.\r\n\r\n"My release!" she said, seating herself on the chair from which he\r\nhad risen. "My release from a misfortune! No;--but my fall from\r\nheaven! Oh, what a man he is! That he should have loved me, and that\r\nI should have driven him away from me!" Her thoughts travelled off to\r\nthe sweetness of that home at Nethercoats, to the excellence of that\r\nmaster who might have been hers; and then in an agony of despair\r\nshe told herself that she had been an idiot and a fool, as well as\r\na traitor. What had she wanted in life that she should have thus\r\nquarrelled with as happy a lot as ever had been offered to a woman?\r\nHad she not been mad, when she sent from her side the only man that\r\nshe loved,--the only man that she had ever truly respected? For hours\r\nshe sat there, all alone, putting out the candles which the servant\r\nhad lighted for her, and leaving untasted the tea that was brought to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! I hope that she may be forgiven. It was her special\r\nfault, that when at Rome she longed for Tibur, and when at Tibur\r\nshe regretted Rome. Not that her cousin George is to be taken as\r\nrepresenting the joys of the great capital, though Mr. Grey may be\r\npresumed to form no inconsiderable part of the promised delights\r\nof the country. Now that she had sacrificed her Tibur, because it\r\nhad seemed to her that the sunny quiet of its pastures lacked the\r\nexcitement necessary for the happiness of life, she was again\r\nprepared to quarrel with the heartlessness of Rome, and already was\r\nagain sighing for the tranquillity of the country.\r\n\r\nSitting there, full of these regrets, she declared to herself that\r\nshe would wait for her father\'s return, and then, throwing herself\r\nupon his love and upon his mercy, would beg him to go to Mr. Grey and\r\nask for pardon for her. "I should be very humble to him," she said;\r\n"but he is so good, that I may dare to be humble before him." So\r\nshe waited for her father. She waited till twelve, till one, till\r\ntwo;--but still he did not come. Later than that she did not dare to\r\nwait for him. She feared to trust him on such business returning so\r\nlate as that,--after so many cigars; after, perhaps, some superfluous\r\nbeakers of club nectar. His temper at such a moment would not be fit\r\nfor such work as hers. But if he was late in coming home, who had\r\nsent him away from his home in unhappiness? Between two and three she\r\nwent to bed, and on the following morning she left Queen Anne Street\r\nfor the Great Western Station before her father was up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nParamount Crescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Macleod lived at No. 3, Paramount Crescent, in Cheltenham, where\r\nshe occupied a very handsome first-floor drawing-room, with a bedroom\r\nbehind it, looking over a stable-yard, and a small room which would\r\nhave been the dressing-room had the late Sir Archibald been alive,\r\nbut which was at present called the dining-room: and in it Lady\r\nMacleod did dine whenever her larger room was to be used for any\r\npurposes of evening company. The vicinity of the stable-yard was not\r\nregarded by the tenant as among the attractions of the house; but it\r\nhad the effect of lowering the rent, and Lady Macleod was a woman who\r\nregarded such matters. Her income, though small, would have sufficed\r\nto enable her to live removed from such discomforts; but she was one\r\nof those women who regard it as a duty to leave something behind\r\nthem,--even though it be left to those who do not at all want it;\r\nand Lady Macleod was a woman who wilfully neglected no duty. So\r\nshe pinched herself, and inhaled the effluvia of the stables, and\r\nsquabbled with the cabmen, in order that she might bequeath a\r\nthousand pounds or two to some Lady Midlothian, who cared, perhaps,\r\nlittle for her, and would hardly thank her memory for the money.\r\n\r\nHad Alice consented to live with her, she would have merged that duty\r\nof leaving money behind her in that other duty of finding a home for\r\nher adopted niece. But Alice had gone away, and therefore the money\r\nwas due to Lady Midlothian rather than to her. The saving, however,\r\nwas postponed whenever Alice would consent to visit Cheltenham; and a\r\nbedroom was secured for her which did not look out over the stables.\r\nAccommodation was also found for her maid much better than that\r\nprovided for Lady Macleod\'s own maid. She was a hospitable, good old\r\nwoman, painfully struggling to do the best she could in the world. It\r\nwas a pity that she was such a bore, a pity that she was so hard to\r\ncabmen and others, a pity that she suspected all tradesmen, servants,\r\nand people generally of a rank of life inferior to her own, a pity\r\nthat she was disposed to condemn for ever and ever so many of her own\r\nrank because they played cards on week days, and did not go to church\r\non Sundays,--and a pity, as I think above all, that while she was\r\nso suspicious of the poor she was so lenient to the vices of earls,\r\nearl\'s sons, and such like.\r\n\r\nAlice, having fully considered the matter, had thought it most\r\nprudent to tell Lady Macleod by letter what she had done in regard\r\nto Mr. Grey. There had been many objections to the writing of such a\r\nletter, but there appeared to be stronger objection to that telling\r\nit face to face which would have been forced upon her had she not\r\nwritten. There would in such case have arisen on Lady Macleod\'s\r\ncountenance a sternness of rebuke which Alice did not choose\r\nto encounter. The same sternness of rebuke would come upon the\r\ncountenance on receipt of the written information; but it would come\r\nin its most aggravated form on the immediate receipt of the letter,\r\nand some of its bitterness would have passed away before Alice\'s\r\narrival. I think that Alice was right. It is better for both parties\r\nthat any great offence should be confessed by letter.\r\n\r\nBut Alice trembled as the cab drew up at No. 3, Paramount Crescent.\r\nShe met her aunt, as was usual, just inside the drawing-room door,\r\nand she saw at once that if any bitterness had passed away from that\r\nface, the original bitterness must indeed have been bitter. She had\r\nso timed her letter that Lady Macleod should have no opportunity of\r\nanswering it. The answer was written there in the mingled anger and\r\nsorrow of those austere features.\r\n\r\n"Alice!" she said, as she took her niece in her arms and kissed her;\r\n"oh, Alice, what is this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, aunt; it is very bad, I know," and poor Alice tried to make a\r\njest of it. "Young ladies are very wicked when they don\'t know their\r\nown minds. But if they haven\'t known them and have been wicked, what\r\ncan they do but repent?"\r\n\r\n"Repent!" said Lady Macleod. "Yes; I hope you will repent. Poor Mr.\r\nGrey;--what must he think of it?"\r\n\r\n"I can only hope, aunt, that he won\'t think of it at all for very\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, my dear, Of course he\'ll think of it, and of course\r\nyou\'ll marry him."\r\n\r\n"Shall I, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you will. Why, Alice, hasn\'t it been all settled among\r\nfamilies? Lady Midlothian knew all the particulars of it just as\r\nwell as I did. And is not your word pledged to him? I really don\'t\r\nunderstand what you mean. I don\'t see how it is possible you should\r\ngo back. Gentlemen when they do that kind of thing are put out of\r\nsociety;--but I really think it is worse in a woman."\r\n\r\n"Then they may if they please put me out of society;--only that I\r\ndon\'t know that I\'m particularly in it."\r\n\r\n"And the wickedness of the thing, Alice! I\'m obliged to say so."\r\n\r\n"When you talk to me about society, aunt, and about Lady Midlothian,\r\nI give up to you, willingly;--the more willingly, perhaps, because I\r\ndon\'t care much for one or the other." Here Lady Macleod tried to say\r\na word; but she failed, and Alice went on, boldly looking up into her\r\naunt\'s face, which became a shade more bitter than ever. "But when\r\nyou tell me about wickedness and my conscience, then I must be my own\r\njudge. It is my conscience, and the fear of committing wickedness,\r\nthat has made me do this."\r\n\r\n"You should submit to be guided by your elders, Alice."\r\n\r\n"No; my elders in such a matter as this cannot teach me. It cannot be\r\nright that I should go to a man\'s house and be his wife, if I do not\r\nthink that I can make him happy."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you accept him?"\r\n\r\n"Because I was mistaken. I am not going to defend that. If you choose\r\nto scold me for that, you may do so, aunt, and I will not answer you.\r\nBut as to marrying him or not marrying him now,--as to that, I must\r\njudge for myself."\r\n\r\n"It was a pity you did not know your own mind earlier."\r\n\r\n"It was a pity,--a great pity. I have done myself an injury that is\r\nquite irretrievable;--I know that, and am prepared to bear it. I have\r\ndone him, too, an injustice which I regret with my whole heart. I\r\ncan only excuse myself by saying that I might have done him a worse\r\ninjustice."\r\n\r\nAll this was said at the very moment of her arrival, and the greeting\r\ndid not seem to promise much for the happiness of the next month; but\r\nperhaps it was better for them both that the attack and the defence\r\nshould thus be made suddenly, at their first meeting. It is better to\r\npull the string at once when you are in the shower-bath, and not to\r\nstand shivering, thinking of the inevitable shock which you can only\r\npostpone for a few minutes. Lady Macleod in this case had pulled the\r\nstring, and thus reaped the advantage of her alacrity.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said her ladyship, "I suppose you will like to go\r\nup-stairs and take off your bonnet. Mary shall bring you some tea\r\nwhen you come down." So Alice escaped, and when she returned to the\r\ncomfort of her cup of tea in the drawing-room, the fury of the storm\r\nhad passed away. She sat talking of other things till dinner; and\r\nthough Lady Macleod did during the evening make one allusion to "poor\r\nMr. Grey," the subject was allowed to drop. Alice was very tender as\r\nto her aunt\'s ailments, was more than ordinarily attentive to the\r\nlong list of Cheltenham iniquities which was displayed to her, and\r\nrefrained from combating any of her aunt\'s religious views. After\r\na while they got upon the subject of Aunt Greenow, for whose name\r\nLady Macleod had a special aversion,--as indeed she had for all the\r\nVavasor side of Alice\'s family; and then Alice offered to read, and\r\ndid read to her aunt many pages out of one of those terrible books of\r\nwrath, which from time to time come forth and tell us that there is\r\nno hope for us. Lady Macleod liked to be so told; and as she now,\r\npoor woman, could not read at nights herself, she enjoyed her\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nLady Macleod no doubt did enjoy her niece\'s sojourn at Cheltenham,\r\nbut I do not think it could have been pleasant to Alice. On the\r\nsecond day nothing was said about Mr. Grey, and Alice hoped that by\r\nher continual readings in the book of wrath her aunt\'s heart might\r\nbe softened towards her. But it seemed that Lady Macleod measured\r\nthe periods of respite, for on the third day and on the fifth she\r\nreturned to the attack. "Did John Grey still wish that the match\r\nshould go on?" she asked, categorically. It was in vain that Alice\r\ntried to put aside the question, and begged that the matter might\r\nnot be discussed. Lady Macleod insisted on her right to carry on the\r\nexamination, and Alice was driven to acknowledge that she believed he\r\ndid wish it. She could hardly say otherwise, seeing that she had at\r\nthat moment a letter from him in her pocket, in which he still spoke\r\nof his engagement as being absolutely binding on him, and expressed a\r\nhope that this change from London to Cheltenham would bring her round\r\nand set everything to rights. He certainly did, in a fashion, wave\r\nhis hand over her, as Kate had said of him. This letter Alice had\r\nresolved that she would not answer. He would probably write again,\r\nand she would beg him to desist. Instead of Cheltenham bringing her\r\nround, Cheltenham had made her firmer than ever in her resolution. I\r\nam inclined to think that the best mode of bringing her round at this\r\nmoment would have been a course of visits from her cousin George, and\r\na series of letters from her cousin Kate. Lady Macleod\'s injunctions\r\nwould certainly not bring her round.\r\n\r\nAfter ten days, ten terrible days, devoted to discussions on\r\nmatrimony in the morning, and to the book of wrath in the\r\nevening,--relieved by two tea-parties, in which the sins of\r\nCheltenham were discussed at length,--Lady Macleod herself got a\r\nletter from Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey\'s kindest compliments to Lady Macleod.\r\nHe believed that Lady Macleod was aware of the circumstances of his\r\nengagement with Miss Vavasor. Might he call on Miss Vavasor at Lady\r\nMacleod\'s house in Cheltenham? and might he also hope to have the\r\npleasure of making Lady Macleod\'s acquaintance? Alice had been in\r\nthe room when her aunt received this letter, but her aunt had said\r\nnothing, and Alice had not known from whom the letter had come.\r\nWhen her aunt crept away with it after breakfast she had suspected\r\nnothing, and had never imagined that Lady Macleod, in the privacy of\r\nher own room looking out upon the stables, had addressed a letter to\r\nNethercoats. But such a letter had been addressed to Nethercoats,\r\nand Mr. Grey had been informed that he would be received in Paramount\r\nCrescent with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Grey had even indicated the day on which he would come, and on the\r\nmorning of that day Lady Macleod had presided over the two teacups\r\nin a state of nervous excitement which was quite visible to Alice.\r\nMore than once Alice asked little questions, not supposing that she\r\nwas specially concerned in the matter which had caused her aunt\'s\r\nfidgety restlessness, but observing it so plainly that it was almost\r\nimpossible not to allude to it. "There\'s nothing the matter, my dear,\r\nat all," at last Lady Macleod said; but as she said so she was making\r\nup her mind that the moment had not come in which she must apprise\r\nAlice of Mr. Grey\'s intended visit. As Alice had questioned her at the\r\nbreakfast table she would say nothing about it then, but waited till\r\nthe teacups were withdrawn, and till the maid had given her last\r\nofficious poke to the fire. Then she began. She had Mr. Grey\'s letter\r\nin her pocket, and as she prepared herself to speak, she pulled it\r\nout and held it on the little table before her.\r\n\r\n"Alice," she said, "I expect a visitor here to-day."\r\n\r\nAlice knew instantly who was the expected visitor. Probably any girl\r\nunder such circumstances would have known equally well. "A visitor,\r\naunt," she said, and managed to hide her knowledge admirably.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Alice a visitor. I should have told you before, only I\r\nthought,--I thought I had better not. It is Mr.--Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, aunt! Is he coming to see you?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--he is desirous no doubt of seeing you more especially; but he\r\nhas expressed a wish to make my acquaintance, which I cannot, under\r\nthe circumstances, think is unnatural. Of course, Alice, he must want\r\nto talk over this affair with your friends."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have spared them," said Alice,--"I wish I could."\r\n\r\n"I have brought his letter here, and you can see it if you please.\r\nIt is very nicely written, and as far as I am concerned I should not\r\nthink of refusing to see him. And now comes the question. What are we\r\nto do with him? Am I to ask him to dinner? I take it for granted that\r\nhe will not expect me to offer him a bed, as he knows that I live in\r\nlodgings."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, aunt; he certainly will not expect that."\r\n\r\n"But ought I to ask him to dinner? I should be most happy to\r\nentertain him, though you know how very scanty my means of doing so\r\nare;--but I really do not know how it might be,--between you and him,\r\nI mean."\r\n\r\n"We should not fight, aunt."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not;--but if you cannot be affectionate in your manner\r\nto him--"\r\n\r\n"I will not answer for my manners, aunt; but you may be sure of\r\nthis,--that I should be affectionate in my heart. I shall always\r\nregard him as a dearly loved friend; though for many years, no doubt,\r\nI shall be unable to express my friendship."\r\n\r\n"That may be all very well, Alice, but it will not be what he will\r\nwant. I think upon the whole that I had better not ask him to\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, aunt."\r\n\r\n"It is a period of the day in which any special constraint among\r\npeople is more disagreeable than at any other time, and then at\r\ndinner the servants must see it. I think there might be some\r\nawkwardness if he were to dine here."\r\n\r\n"I really think there would," said Alice, anxious to have the subject\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\n"I hope he won\'t think that I am inhospitable. I should be so happy\r\nto do the best I could for him, for I regard him, Alice, quite as\r\nthough he were to be your husband. And when anybody at all connected\r\nwith me has come to Cheltenham I always have asked them to dine, and\r\nthen I have Gubbins\'s man to come and wait at table,--as you know."\r\n\r\n"Of all men in the world Mr. Grey is the last to think about it."\r\n\r\n"That should only make me the more careful. But I think it would\r\nperhaps be more comfortable if he were to come in the evening."\r\n\r\n"Much more comfortable, aunt."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he will be here in the afternoon, before dinner, and we\r\nhad better wait at home for him. I dare say he\'ll want to see you\r\nalone, and therefore I\'ll retire to my own rooms,"--looking over\r\nthe stables! Dear old lady. "But if you wish it, I will receive him\r\nfirst--and then Martha,"--Martha was Alice\'s maid--"can fetch you\r\ndown."\r\n\r\nThis discussion as to the propriety or impropriety of giving her\r\nlover a dinner had not been pleasant to Alice, but, nevertheless,\r\nwhen it was over she felt grateful to Lady Macleod. There was an\r\nattempt in the arrangement to make Mr. Grey\'s visit as little painful\r\nas possible; and though such a discussion at such a time might as\r\nwell have been avoided, the decision to which her ladyship had at\r\nlast come with reference both to the dinner and the management of\r\nthe visit was, no doubt, the right one.\r\n\r\nLady Macleod had been quite correct in all her anticipations. At\r\nthree o\'clock Mr. Grey was announced, and Lady Macleod, alone,\r\nreceived him in her drawing-room. She had intended to give him a\r\ngreat deal of good advice, to bid him still keep up his heart and as\r\nit were hold up his head, to confess to him how very badly Alice was\r\nbehaving, and to express her entire concurrence with that theory of\r\nbodily ailment as the cause and origin of her conduct. But she found\r\nthat Mr. Grey was a man to whom she could not give much advice. It\r\nwas he who did the speaking at this conference, and not she. She\r\nwas overawed by him after the first three minutes. Indeed her first\r\nglance at him had awed her. He was so handsome,--and then, in his\r\nbeauty, he had so quiet and almost saddened an air! Strange to say\r\nthat after she had seen him, Lady Macleod entertained for him an\r\ninfinitely higher admiration than before, and yet she was less\r\nsurprised than she had been at Alice\'s refusal of him. The conference\r\nwas very short; and Mr. Grey had not been a quarter of an hour in the\r\nhouse before Martha attended upon her mistress with her summons.\r\n\r\nAlice was ready and came down instantly. She found Mr. Grey standing\r\nin the middle of the room waiting to receive her, and the look of\r\nmajesty which had cowed Lady Macleod had gone from his countenance.\r\nHe could not have received her with a kinder smile, had she come to\r\nhim with a promise that she would at this meeting name the day for\r\ntheir marriage. "At any rate it does not make him unhappy," she said\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n"You are not angry," he said, "that I should have followed you all\r\nthe way here, to see you."\r\n\r\n"No, certainly; not angry, Mr. Grey. All anger that there may be\r\nbetween us must be on your side. I feel that thoroughly."\r\n\r\n"Then there shall be none on either side. Whatever may be done, I\r\nwill not be angry with you. Your father advised me to come down here\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"You have seen him, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have seen him. I was in London the day you left."\r\n\r\n"It is so terrible to think that I should have brought upon you all\r\nthis trouble."\r\n\r\n"You will bring upon me much worse trouble than that unless--.\r\nBut I have not now come down here to tell you that. I believe that\r\naccording to rule in such matters I should not have come to you at\r\nall, but I don\'t know that I care much about such rules."\r\n\r\n"It is I that have broken all rules."\r\n\r\n"When a lady tells a gentleman that she does not wish to see more of\r\nhim--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Grey, I have not told you that."\r\n\r\n"Have you not? I am glad at any rate to hear you deny it. But you\r\nwill understand what I mean. When a gentleman gets his dismissal\r\nfrom a lady he should accept it,--that is, his dismissal under such\r\ncircumstances as I have received mine. But I cannot lay down my love\r\nin that way; nor, maintaining my love, can I give up the battle.\r\nIt seems to me that I have a right at any rate to know something of\r\nyour comings and goings as long as,--unless, Alice, you should take\r\nanother name than mine."\r\n\r\n"My intention is to keep my own." This she said in the lowest\r\npossible tone,--almost in a whisper,--with her eyes fixed upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"And you will not deny me that right?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot hinder you. Whatever you may do, I myself have sinned so\r\nagainst you that I can have no right to blame you."\r\n\r\n"There shall be no question between us of injury from one to\r\nthe other. In any conversation that we may have, or in any\r\ncorrespondence--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Grey, do not ask me to write."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me. Should there be any on either side, there shall be no\r\nidea of any wrong done."\r\n\r\n"But I have done you wrong;--great wrong."\r\n\r\n"No, Alice; I will not have it so. When I asked you to accept my\r\nhand,--begging the greatest boon which it could ever come to my lot\r\nto ask from a fellow-mortal,--I knew well how great was your goodness\r\nto me when you told me that it should be mine. Now that you refuse\r\nit, I know also that you are good, thinking that in doing so you are\r\nacting for my welfare,--thinking more of my welfare than of your\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, yes; it is so, Mr. Grey; indeed it is so."\r\n\r\n"Believing that, how can I talk of wrong? That you are wrong in your\r\nthinking on this subject,--that your mind has become twisted by\r\nfalse impressions,--that I believe. But I cannot therefore love you\r\nless,--nor, so believing, can I consider myself to be injured. Nor am\r\nI even so little selfish as you are. I think if you were my wife that\r\nI could make you happy; but I feel sure that my happiness depends on\r\nyour being my wife."\r\n\r\nShe looked up into his face, but it was still serene in all its manly\r\nbeauty. Her cousin George, if he were moved to strong feeling, showed\r\nit at once in his eyes,--in his mouth, in the whole visage of his\r\ncountenance. He glared in his anger, and was impassioned in his love.\r\nBut Mr. Grey when speaking of the happiness of his entire life, when\r\nconfessing that it was now at stake with a decision against him that\r\nwould be ruinous to it, spoke without a quiver in his voice, and\r\nhad no more sign of passion in his face than if he were telling his\r\ngardener to move a rose tree.\r\n\r\n"I hope--and believe that you will find your happiness elsewhere, Mr.\r\nGrey."\r\n\r\n"Well; we can but differ, Alice. In that we do differ. And now I will\r\nsay one word to explain why I have come here. If I were to write to\r\nyou against your will, it would seem that I were persecuting you. I\r\ncannot bring myself to do that, even though I had the right. But if I\r\nwere to let you go from me, taking what you have said to me and doing\r\nnothing, it would seem that I had accepted your decision as final. I\r\ndo not do so. I will not do so. I come simply to tell you that I am\r\nstill your suitor. If you will let me, I will see you again early\r\nin January,--as soon as you have returned to town. You will hardly\r\nrefuse to see me."\r\n\r\n"No," she said; "I cannot refuse to see you."\r\n\r\n"Then it shall be so," he said, "and I will not trouble you with\r\nletters, nor will I trouble you longer now with words. Tell your aunt\r\nthat I have said what I came to say, and that I give her my kindest\r\nthanks." Then he took her hand and pressed it,--not as George Vavasor\r\nhad pressed it,--and was gone. When Lady Macleod returned, she found\r\nthat the question of the evening\'s tea arrangements had settled\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Roebury Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that George Vavasor had a little establishment at\r\nRoebury, down in Oxfordshire, and thither he betook himself about\r\nthe middle of November. He had been long known in this county, and\r\nwhether or no men spoke well of him as a man of business in London,\r\nmen spoke well of him down there, as one who knew how to ride to\r\nhounds. Not that Vavasor was popular among fellow-sportsmen. It was\r\nquite otherwise. He was not a man that made himself really popular\r\nin any social meetings of men. He did not himself care for the loose\r\nlittle talkings, half flat and half sharp, of men when they meet\r\ntogether in idleness. He was not open enough in his nature for such\r\npopularity. Some men were afraid of him, and some suspected him.\r\nThere were others who made up to him, seeking his intimacy, but these\r\nhe usually snubbed, and always kept at a distance. Though he had\r\nindulged in all the ordinary pleasures of young men, he had never\r\nbeen a jovial man. In his conversations with men he always seemed to\r\nthink that he should use his time towards serving some purpose of\r\nbusiness. With women he was quite the reverse. With women he could be\r\nhappy. With women he could really associate. A woman he could really\r\nlove;--but I doubt whether for all that he could treat a woman well.\r\n\r\nBut he was known in the Oxfordshire country as a man who knew what he\r\nwas about, and such men are always welcome. It is the man who does\r\nnot know how to ride that is made uncomfortable in the hunting field\r\nby cold looks or expressed censure. And yet it is very rarely that\r\nsuch men do any real harm. Such a one may now and then get among\r\nthe hounds or override the hunt, but it is not often so. Many such\r\ncomplaints are made; but in truth the too forward man, who presses\r\nthe dogs, is generally one who can ride, but is too eager or too\r\nselfish to keep in his proper place. The bad rider, like the bad\r\nwhist player, pays highly for what he does not enjoy, and should be\r\nthanked. But at both games he gets cruelly snubbed. At both games\r\nGeorge Vavasor was great and he never got snubbed.\r\n\r\nThere were men who lived together at Roebury in a kind of club,--four\r\nor five of them, who came thither from London, running backwards and\r\nforwards as hunting arrangements enabled them to do so,--a brewer or\r\ntwo and a banker, with a would-be fast attorney, a sporting literary\r\ngentleman, and a young unmarried Member of Parliament who had no\r\nparticular home of his own in the country. These men formed the\r\nRoebury Club, and a jolly life they had of it. They had their own\r\nwine closet at the King\'s Head,--or Roebury Inn as the house had come\r\nto be popularly called,--and supplied their own game. The landlord\r\nfound everything else; and as they were not very particular about\r\ntheir bills, they were allowed to do pretty much as they liked in\r\nthe house. They were rather imperious, very late in their hours,\r\nsometimes, though not often, noisy, and once there had been a hasty\r\nquarrel which had made the landlord in his anger say that the club\r\nshould be turned out of his house. But they paid well, chaffed the\r\nservants much oftener than they bullied them, and on the whole were\r\nvery popular.\r\n\r\nTo this club Vavasor did not belong, alleging that he could not\r\nafford to live at their pace, and alleging, also, that his stays at\r\nRoebury were not long enough to make him a desirable member. The\r\ninvitation to him was not repeated and he lodged elsewhere in the\r\nlittle town. But he occasionally went in of an evening, and would\r\nmake up with the members a table at whist.\r\n\r\nHe had come down to Roebury by mail train, ready for hunting the next\r\nmorning, and walked into the club-room just at midnight. There he\r\nfound Maxwell the banker, Grindley the would-be fast attorney, and\r\nCalder Jones the Member of Parliament, playing dummy. Neither of the\r\nbrewers were there, nor was the sporting literary gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Vavasor," said Maxwell, "and now we won\'t play this\r\nblackguard game any longer. Somebody told me, Vavasor, that you were\r\ngone away."\r\n\r\n"Gone away;--what, like a fox?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it was; that something had happened to you since\r\nlast season; that you were married, or dead, or gone abroad. By\r\nGeorge, I\'ve lost the trick after all! I hate dummy like the devil.\r\nI never hold a card in dummy\'s hand. Yes, I know; that\'s seven points\r\non each side. Vavasor, come and cut. Upon my word if any one had\r\nasked me, I should have said you were dead."\r\n\r\n"But you see, nobody ever does think of asking you anything."\r\n\r\n"What you probably mean," said Grindley, "is that Vavasor was not\r\nreturned for Chelsea last February; but you\'ve seen him since that.\r\nAre you going to try it again, Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll lend me the money I will."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what on earth a man gains by going into the house," said\r\nCalder Jones. "I couldn\'t help myself as it happened, but, upon my\r\nword it\'s a deuce of a bore. A fellow thinks he can do as he likes\r\nabout going,--but he can\'t. It wouldn\'t do for me to give it up,\r\nbecause--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, of course not; where should we all be?" said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s you and me, Grindems," said Maxwell. "D---- parliament, and now\r\nlet\'s have a rubber."\r\n\r\nThey played till three and Mr. Calder Jones lost a good deal of\r\nmoney,--a good deal of money in a little way, for they never played\r\nabove ten-shilling points, and no bet was made for more than a pound\r\nor two. But Vavasor was the winner, and when he left the room he\r\nbecame the subject of some ill-natured remarks.\r\n\r\n"I wonder he likes coming in here," said Grindley, who had himself\r\nbeen the man to invite him to belong to the club, and who had at one\r\ntime indulged the ambition of an intimacy with George Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand it," said Calder Jones, who was a little bitter\r\nabout his money. "Last year he seemed to walk in just when he liked,\r\nas though he were one of us."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a bad sort of fellow," said Grindley; "he\'s so uncommonly dark.\r\nI don\'t know where on earth he gets his money from, He was heir to\r\nsome small property in the north, but he lost every shilling of that\r\nwhen he was in the wine trade."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong there, Grindems," said Maxwell,--making use of a\r\nplayful nickname which he had invented for his friend. "He made a pot\r\nof money at the wine business, and had he stuck to it he would have\r\nbeen a rich man."\r\n\r\n"He\'s lost it all since then, and that place in the north into the\r\nbargain."\r\n\r\n"Wrong again, Grindems, my boy. If old Vavasor were to die to-morrow,\r\nVavasor Hall would go just as he might choose to leave it. George may\r\nbe a ruined man for aught I know--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt about that, I believe," said Grindley.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, Grindems; but he can\'t have lost Vavasor Hall because\r\nhe has never as yet had an interest in it. He\'s the natural heir, and\r\nwill probably get it some day."\r\n\r\n"All the same," said Calder Jones, "isn\'t it rather odd he should\r\ncome in here?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve asked him often enough," said Maxwell; "not because we like\r\nhim, but because we want him so often to make up a rubber. I don\'t\r\nlike George Vavasor, and I don\'t know who does; but I like him\r\nbetter than dummy. And I\'d sooner play whist with men I don\'t like,\r\nGrindems, than I\'d not play at all." A bystander might have thought\r\nfrom the tone of Mr. Maxwell\'s voice that he was alluding to Mr.\r\nGrindley himself, but Mr. Grindley didn\'t seem to take it in that\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, of course," said he. "We can\'t pick men just as we\r\nplease. But I certainly didn\'t think that he\'d make it out for\r\nanother season."\r\n\r\nThe club breakfasted the next morning at nine o\'clock, in order that\r\nthey might start at half-past for the meet at Edgehill. Edgehill is\r\ntwelve miles from Roebury, and the hacks would do it in an hour and\r\na half,--or perhaps a little less. "Does anybody know anything about\r\nthat brown horse of Vavasor\'s?" said Maxwell. "I saw him coming into\r\nthe yard yesterday with that old groom of his."\r\n\r\n"He had a brown horse last season," said Grindley;--"a little thing\r\nthat went very fast, but wasn\'t quite sound on the road."\r\n\r\n"That was a mare," said Maxwell, "and he sold her to Cinquebars."*\r\n\r\n\r\n   [*Ah, my friend, from whom I have borrowed this scion of the\r\n   nobility! Had he been left with us he would have forgiven me\r\n   my little theft, and now that he has gone I will not change\r\n   the name.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"For a hundred and fifty," said Calder Jones, "and she wasn\'t worth\r\nthe odd fifty."\r\n\r\n"He won seventy with her at Leamington," said Maxwell, "and I doubt\r\nwhether he\'d take his money now."\r\n\r\n"Is Cinquebars coming down here this year?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Maxwell. "I hope not. He\'s the best fellow in\r\nthe world, but he can\'t ride, and he don\'t care for hunting, and he\r\nmakes more row than any fellow I ever met. I wish some fellow could\r\ntell me something about that fellow\'s brown horse."\r\n\r\n"I\'d never buy a horse of Vavasor\'s if I were you," said Grindley.\r\n"He never has anything that\'s all right all round."\r\n\r\n"And who has?" said Maxwell, as he took into his plate a second\r\nmutton chop, which had just been brought up hot into the room\r\nespecially for him. "That\'s the mistake men make about horses, and\r\nthat\'s why there\'s so much cheating. I never ask for a warranty with\r\na horse, and don\'t very often have a horse examined. Yet I do as\r\nwell as others. You can\'t have perfect horses any more than you can\r\nperfect men, or perfect women. You put up with red hair, or bad\r\nteeth, or big feet,--or sometimes with the devil of a voice. But a\r\nman when he wants a horse won\'t put up with anything! Therefore those\r\nwho\'ve got horses to sell must lie. When I go into the market with\r\nthree hundred pounds I expect a perfect animal. As I never do that\r\nnow I never expect a perfect animal. I like \'em to see; I like \'em to\r\nhave four legs; and I like \'em to have a little wind. I don\'t much\r\nmind anything else."\r\n\r\n"By Jove you\'re about right," said Calder Jones. The reader will\r\ntherefore readily see that Mr. Maxwell the banker reigned as king in\r\nthat club.\r\n\r\nVavasor had sent two horses on in charge of Bat Smithers, and\r\nfollowed on a pony about fourteen hands high, which he had ridden as\r\na cover hack for the last four years. He did not start till near ten,\r\nbut he was able to catch Bat with his two horses about a mile and a\r\nhalf on that side of Edgehill. "Have you managed to come along pretty\r\nclean?" the master asked as he came up with his servant.\r\n\r\n"They be the most beastly roads in all England," said Bat, who always\r\nfound fault with any county in which he happened to be located. "But\r\nI\'ll warrant I\'m cleaner than most on \'em. What for any county should\r\nmake such roads as them I never could tell."\r\n\r\n"The roads about there are bad, certainly;--very bad. But I suppose\r\nthey would have been better had Providence sent better materials. And\r\nwhat do you think of the brown horse, Bat?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir." He said no more, and that he said with a drawl.\r\n\r\n"He\'s as fine an animal to look at as ever I put my eye on," said\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n"He\'s all that," said Bat.\r\n\r\n"He\'s got lots of pace too."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he has, sir."\r\n\r\n"And they tell me you can\'t beat him at jumping."\r\n\r\n"They can mostly do that, sir, if they\'re well handled."\r\n\r\n"You see he\'s a deal over my weight."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is, Mr. Vavasor. He is a fourteen stoner."\r\n\r\n"Or fifteen," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he may, sir. There\'s no knowing what a \'orse can carry till\r\nhe\'s tried."\r\n\r\nGeorge asked his groom no more questions, but felt sure that he had\r\nbetter sell his brown horse if he could. Now I here protest that\r\nthere was nothing specially amiss with the brown horse. Towards the\r\nend of the preceding season he had overreached himself and had been\r\nlame, and had been sold by some owner with more money than brains who\r\nhad not cared to wait for a cure. Then there had gone with him a bad\r\ncharacter, and a vague suspicion had attached itself to him, as there\r\ndoes to hundreds of horses which are very good animals in their way.\r\nHe had come thus to Tattersall\'s, and Vavasor had bought him cheap,\r\nthinking that he might make money of him, from his form and action.\r\nHe had found nothing amiss with him,--nor, indeed, had Bat Smithers.\r\nBut his character went with him, and therefore Bat Smithers thought\r\nit well to be knowing. George Vavasor knew as much of horses as most\r\nmen can,--as, perhaps, as any man can who is not a dealer, or a\r\nveterinary surgeon; but he, like all men, doubted his own knowledge,\r\nthough on that subject he would never admit that he doubted it.\r\nTherefore he took Bat\'s word and felt sure that the horse was wrong.\r\n\r\n"We shall have a run from the big wood," said George.\r\n\r\n"If they make un break, you will, sir," said Bat.\r\n\r\n"At any rate I\'ll ride the brown horse," said George. Then, as soon\r\nas that was settled between them, the Roebury Club overtook them.\r\n\r\nThere was now a rush of horses on the road altogether, and they were\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile of Edgehill church, close to which was the\r\nmeet. Bat with his two hunters fell a little behind, and the others\r\ntrotted on together. The other grooms with their animals were on in\r\nadvance, and were by this time employed in combing out forelocks, and\r\nrubbing stirrup leathers and horses\' legs free from the dirt of the\r\nroads;--but Bat Smithers was like his master, and did not congregate\r\nmuch with other men, and Vavasor was sure to give orders to his\r\nservant different from the orders given by others.\r\n\r\n"Are you well mounted this year?" Maxwell asked of George Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; I never was what I call well mounted yet. I generally\r\nhave one horse and three or four cripples. That brown horse behind\r\nthere is pretty good, I believe."\r\n\r\n"I see your man has got the old chestnut mare with him."\r\n\r\n"She\'s one of the cripples,--not but what she\'s as sound as a bell,\r\nand as good a hunter as ever I wish to ride; but she makes a little\r\nnoise when she\'s going."\r\n\r\n"So that you can hear her three fields off," said Grindley.\r\n\r\n"Five if the fields are small enough and your ears are sharp enough,"\r\nsaid Vavasor. "All the same I wouldn\'t change her for the best horse\r\nI ever saw under you."\r\n\r\n"Had you there, Grindems," said Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t," said Grindley. "He didn\'t have me at all."\r\n\r\n"Your horses, Grindley, are always up to all the work they have to\r\ndo," said George; "and I don\'t know what any man wants more than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Had you again, Grindems," said Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"I can ride against him any day," said Grindley.\r\n\r\n"Yes; or against a brick wall either, if your horse didn\'t know any\r\nbetter," said George.\r\n\r\n"Had you again, Grindems," said Maxwell. Whereupon Mr. Grindley\r\ntrotted on, round the corner by the church, and into the field in\r\nwhich the hounds were assembled. The fire had become too hot for him,\r\nand he thought it best to escape. Had it been Vavasor alone he would\r\nhave turned upon him and snarled, but he could not afford to exhibit\r\nany ill temper to the king of the club. Mr. Grindley was not popular,\r\nand were Maxwell to turn openly against him his sporting life down at\r\nRoebury would decidedly be a failure.\r\n\r\nThe lives of such men as Mr. Grindley,--men who are tolerated in the\r\ndaily society of others who are accounted their superiors, do not\r\nseem to have many attractions. And yet how many such men does one see\r\nin almost every set? Why Mr. Grindley should have been inferior to Mr.\r\nMaxwell the banker, or to Stone, or to Prettyman who were brewers, or\r\neven to Mr. Pollock the heavy-weight literary gentleman, I can hardly\r\nsay. An attorney by his trade is at any rate as good as a brewer, and\r\nthere are many attorneys who hold their heads high anywhere. Grindley\r\nwas a rich man,--or at any rate rich enough for the life he led.\r\nI don\'t know much about his birth, but I believe it was as good as\r\nMaxwell\'s. He was not ignorant, or a fool;--whereas I rather think\r\nMaxwell was a fool. Grindley had made his own way in the world, but\r\nMaxwell would certainly not have made himself a banker if his father\r\nhad not been a banker before him; nor could the bank have gone on\r\nand prospered had there not been partners there who were better men\r\nof business than our friend. Grindley knew that he had a better\r\nintellect than Maxwell; and yet he allowed Maxwell to snub him, and\r\nhe toadied Maxwell in return. It was not on the score of riding that\r\nMaxwell claimed and held his superiority, for Grindley did not want\r\npluck, and every one knew that Maxwell had lived freely and that his\r\nnerves were not what they had been. I think it had come from the\r\noutward look of the men, from the form of each, from the gait and\r\nvisage which in one was good and in the other insignificant. The\r\nnature of such dominion of man over man is very singular, but this is\r\ncertain that when once obtained in manhood it may be easily held.\r\n\r\nAmong boys at school the same thing is even more conspicuous, because\r\nboys have less of conscience than men, are more addicted to tyranny,\r\nand when weak are less prone to feel the misery and disgrace of\r\nsuccumbing. Who has been through a large school and does not remember\r\nthe Maxwells and Grindleys,--the tyrants and the slaves,--those who\r\ndomineered and those who submitted? Nor was it, even then, personal\r\nstrength, nor always superior courage, that gave the power of\r\ncommand. Nor was it intellect, or thoughtfulness, nor by any means\r\nsuch qualities as make men and boys lovable. It is said by many\r\nwho have had to deal with boys, that certain among them claim and\r\nobtain ascendancy by the spirit within them; but I doubt whether the\r\nascendancy is not rather thrust on them than claimed by them. Here\r\nagain I think the outward gait of the boy goes far towards obtaining\r\nfor him the submission of his fellows.\r\n\r\nBut the tyrant boy does not become the tyrant man, or the slave boy\r\nthe slave man, because the outward visage, that has been noble or\r\nmean in the one, changes and becomes so often mean or noble in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"By George, there\'s Pollock!" said Maxwell, as he rode into the\r\nfield by the church. "I\'ll bet half a crown that he\'s come down from\r\nLondon this morning, that he was up all night last night, and that he\r\ntells us so three times before the hounds go out of the paddock." Mr.\r\nPollock was the heavy-weight sporting literary gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nEdgehill.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all sights in the world there is, I think, none more beautiful\r\nthan that of a pack of fox-hounds seated, on a winter morning, round\r\nthe huntsman, if the place of meeting has been chosen with anything\r\nof artistic skill. It should be in a grassy field, and the field\r\nshould be small. It should not be absolutely away from all buildings,\r\nand the hedgerows should not have been clipped and pared, and made\r\nstraight with reference to modern agricultural economy. There should\r\nbe trees near, and the ground should be a little uneven, so as to\r\nmark some certain small space as the exact spot where the dogs and\r\nservants of the hunt should congregate.\r\n\r\nThere are well-known grand meets in England, in the parks of\r\nnoblemen, before their houses, or even on what are called their\r\nlawns; but these magnificent affairs have but little of the beauty\r\nof which I speak. Such assemblies are too grand and too ornate, and,\r\nmoreover, much too far removed from true sporting proprieties. At\r\nthem, equipages are shining, and ladies\' dresses are gorgeous, and\r\ncrowds of tradesmen from the neighbouring town have come there to\r\nlook at the grand folk. To my eye there is nothing beautiful in\r\nthat. The meet I speak of is arranged with a view to sport, but the\r\naccident of the locality may make it the prettiest thing in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSuch, in a special degree, was the case at Edgehill. At Edgehill the\r\nwhole village consisted of three or four cottages; but there was a\r\nsmall old church, with an old grey tower, and a narrow, green, almost\r\ndark, churchyard, surrounded by elm-trees. The road from Roebury to\r\nthe meet passed by the church stile, and turning just beyond it came\r\nupon the gate which led into the little field in which the hounds\r\nfelt themselves as much at home as in their kennels. There might be\r\nsix or seven acres in the field, which was long and narrow, so that\r\nthe huntsman had space to walk leisurely up and down with the pack\r\nclustering round him, when he considered that longer sitting might\r\nchill them. The church tower was close at hand, visible through\r\nthe trees, and the field itself was green and soft, though never\r\nsplashing with mud or heavy with holes.\r\n\r\nEdgehill was a favourite meet in that country, partly because foxes\r\nwere very abundant in the great wood adjacent, partly because the\r\nwhole country around is grass-land, and partly, no doubt, from the\r\nsporting propensities of the neighbouring population. As regards my\r\nown taste, I do not know that I do like beginning a day with a great\r\nwood,--and if not beginning it, certainly not ending it. It is hard\r\nto come upon the cream of hunting, as it is upon the cream of any\r\nother delight. Who can always drink Lafitte of the finest, can always\r\ntalk to a woman who is both beautiful and witty, or can always find\r\nthe right spirit in the poetry he reads? A man has usually to work\r\nthrough much mud before he gets his nugget. It is so certainly in\r\nhunting, and a big wood too frequently afflicts the sportsman, as the\r\nmud does the miner. The small gorse cover is the happy, much-envied\r\nbit of ground in which the gold is sure to show itself readily. But\r\nwithout the woods the gorse would not hold the foxes, and without the\r\nmud the gold would not have found its resting-place.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, Edgehill was a popular meet, and, as regarded\r\nthe meet itself, was eminently picturesque. On the present occasion\r\nthe little field was full of horsemen, moving about slowly, chatting\r\ntogether, smoking cigars, getting off from their hacks and mounting\r\ntheir hunters, giving orders to their servants, and preparing for the\r\nday. There were old country gentlemen there, greeting each other from\r\nfar sides of the county; sporting farmers who love to find themselves\r\nalongside their landlords, and to feel that the pleasures of the\r\ncountry are common to both; men down from town, like our friends\r\nof the Roebury club, who made hunting their chosen pleasure, and\r\nwho formed, in number, perhaps the largest portion of the field;\r\nofficers from garrisons round about; a cloud of servants, and a\r\nfew nondescript stragglers who had picked up horses, hither and\r\nthither, round the country. Outside the gate on the road were drawn\r\nup a variety of vehicles, open carriages, dog-carts, gigs, and\r\nwaggonettes, in some few of which were seated ladies who had come\r\nover to see the meet. But Edgehill was, essentially, not a ladies\'\r\nmeet. The distances to it were long, and the rides in Cranby\r\nWood--the big wood--were not adapted for wheels. There were one or\r\ntwo ladies on horseback, as is always the case; but Edgehill was not\r\na place popular, even with hunting ladies. One carriage, that of the\r\nold master of the hounds, had entered the sacred precincts of the\r\nfield, and from this the old baronet was just descending, as Maxwell,\r\nCalder Jones, and Vavasor rode into the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edgehill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I hope I see you well, Sir William," said Maxwell, greeting the\r\nmaster. Calder Jones also made his little speech, and so did Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"Humph--well, yes, I\'m pretty well, thank\'ee. Just move on, will you?\r\nMy mare can\'t stir here." Then some one else spoke to him, and he\r\nonly grunted in answer. Having slowly been assisted up on to his\r\nhorse,--for he was over seventy years of age,--he trotted off to the\r\nhounds, while all the farmers round him touched their hats to him.\r\nBut his mind was laden with affairs of import, and he noticed no one.\r\nIn a whispered voice he gave his instructions to his huntsman, who\r\nsaid, "Yes, Sir William," "No, Sir William," "No doubt, Sir William."\r\nOne long-eared, long-legged fellow, in a hunting-cap and scarlet\r\ncoat, hung listening by, anxious to catch something of the orders for\r\nthe morning. "Who the devil\'s that fellow, that\'s all breeches and\r\nboots?" said Sir William aloud to some one near him, as the huntsman\r\nmoved off with the hounds. Sir William knew the man well enough, but\r\nwas minded to punish him for his discourtesy. "Where shall we find\r\nfirst, Sir William?" said Calder Jones, in a voice that was really\r\nvery humble. "How the mischief am I to know where the foxes are?"\r\nsaid Sir William, with an oath; and Calder Jones retired unhappy, and\r\nfor the moment altogether silenced.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Sir William was the most popular man in the county, and no\r\nmore courteous gentleman ever sat at the bottom of his own table. A\r\nmild man he was, too, when out of his saddle, and one by no means\r\ndisposed to assume special supremacy. But a master of hounds, if he\r\nhave long held the country,--and Sir William had held his for more\r\nthan thirty years,--obtains a power which that of no other potentate\r\ncan equal. He may say and do what he pleases, and his tyranny is\r\nalways respected. No conspiracy against him has a chance of success;\r\nno sedition will meet with sympathy;--that is, if he be successful\r\nin showing sport. If a man be sworn at, abused, and put down without\r\ncause, let him bear it and think that he has been a victim for the\r\npublic good. And let him never be angry with the master. That rough\r\ntongue is the necessity of the master\'s position. They used to say\r\nthat no captain could manage a ship without swearing at his men.\r\nBut what are the captain\'s troubles in comparison with those of the\r\nmaster of hounds? The captain\'s men are under discipline, and can\r\nbe locked up, flogged, or have their grog stopped. The master of\r\nhounds cannot stop the grog of any offender, and he can only stop the\r\ntongue, or horse, of such an one by very sharp words.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pollock, when did you come?" said Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"By George," said the literary gentleman, "just down from London by\r\nthe 8.30 from Euston Square, and got over here from Winslow in a\r\ntrap, with two fellows I never saw in my life before. We came tandem\r\nin a fly, and did the nineteen miles in an hour."\r\n\r\n"Come, Athenian, draw it mild," said Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"We did, indeed. I wonder whether they\'ll pay me their share of the\r\nfly. I had to leave Onslow Crescent at a quarter before eight, and I\r\ndid three hours\' work before I started."\r\n\r\n"Then you did it by candle-light," said Grindley.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did; and why shouldn\'t I? Do you suppose no one can work\r\nby candle-light except a lawyer? I suppose you fellows were playing\r\nwhist, and drinking hard. I\'m uncommon glad I wasn\'t with you, for I\r\nshall be able to ride."\r\n\r\n"I bet you a pound," said Jones, "if there\'s a run, I see more of it\r\nthan you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take that bet with Jones," said Grindley, "and Vavasor shall be\r\nthe judge."\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, the hounds can\'t get out, if you will stop up the gate,"\r\nsaid Sir William. Then the pack passed through, and they all trotted\r\non for four miles, to Cranby Wood.\r\n\r\nVavasor, as he rode on to the wood, was alone, or speaking, from time\r\nto time, a few words to his servant. "I\'ll ride the chestnut mare in\r\nthe wood," he said, "and do you keep near me."\r\n\r\n"I bean\'t to be galloping up and down them rides, I suppose," said\r\nBat, almost contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t gallop up and down the rides, myself; but do you mark me,\r\nto know where I am, so that I can change if a fox should go away."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be here all day, sir. That\'s my belief."\r\n\r\n"If so, I won\'t ride the brown horse at all. But do you take care to\r\nlet me have him if there\'s a chance. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I understand, sir. There ain\'t no difficulty in my\r\nunderstanding;--only I don\'t think, sir, you\'ll ever get a fox out\r\nof that wood to-day. Why, it stands to reason. The wind\'s from the\r\nnorth-east."\r\n\r\nCranby Wood is very large,--there being, in truth, two or three woods\r\ntogether. It was nearly twelve before they found; and then for an\r\nhour there was great excitement among the men, who rode up and down\r\nthe rides as the hounds drove the fox from one end to another of the\r\nenclosure. Once or twice the poor animal did try to go away, and then\r\nthere was great hallooing, galloping, and jumping over unnecessary\r\nfences; but he was headed back again, or changed his mind, not liking\r\nthe north-east wind of which Bat Smithers had predicted such bad\r\nthings. After one the crowd of men became rather more indifferent,\r\nand clustered together in broad spots, eating their lunch, smoking\r\ncigars, and chaffing each other. It was singular to observe the\r\namazing quantity of ham sandwiches and of sherry that had been\r\ncarried into Cranby Wood on that day. Grooms appeared to have been\r\nladen with cases, and men were as well armed with flasks at their\r\nsaddle-bows as they used to be with pistols. Maxwell and Pollock\r\nformed the centre of one of these crowds, and chaffed each other with\r\nthe utmost industry, till, tired of having inflicted no wounds, they\r\nturned upon Grindley and drove him out of the circle. "You\'ll make\r\nthat man cut his throat, if you go on at that," said Pollock. "Shall\r\nI?" said Maxwell. "Then I\'ll certainly stick to him for the sake of\r\nhumanity in general." During all this time Vavasor sat apart, quite\r\nalone, and Bat Smithers grimly kept his place, about three hundred\r\nyards from him.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t do any good to-day," said Grindley, coming up to Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"That old fellow has got to be so stupid, he doesn\'t know what he\'s\r\nabout," said Grindley, meaning Sir William.\r\n\r\n"How can he make the fox break?" said Vavasor; and as his voice was\r\nby no means encouraging Grindley rode away.\r\n\r\nLunch and cigars lasted till two, during which hour the hounds, the\r\nhuntsmen, the whips, and old Sir William were hard at work, as also\r\nwere some few others who persistently followed every chance of the\r\ngame. From that till three there were two or three flashes in the\r\npan, and false reports as to foxes which had gone away, which first\r\nset men galloping, and then made them very angry. After three, men\r\nbegan to say naughty things, to abuse Cranby Wood, to wish violently\r\nthat they had remained at home or gone elsewhere, and to speak\r\nirreverently of their ancient master. "It\'s the cussidest place in\r\nall creation," said Maxwell. "I often said I\'d not come here any\r\nmore, and now I say it again."\r\n\r\n"And yet you\'ll be here the next meet," said Grindley, who had\r\nsneaked back to his old companions in weariness of spirit.\r\n\r\n"Grindems, you know a sight too much," said Maxwell; "you do indeed.\r\nAn ordinary fellow has no chance with you."\r\n\r\nGrindley was again going to catch it, but was on this time saved by\r\nthe appearance of the huntsman, who came galloping up one of the\r\nrides, with a lot of the hounds at his heels.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t away, Tom, surely?" said Maxwell.\r\n\r\n"He\'s out of the wood somewheres," said Tom;--and off they all went.\r\nVavasor changed his horse, getting on to the brown one, and giving\r\nup his chestnut mare to Bat Smithers, who suggested that he might\r\nas well go home to Roebury now. Vavasor gave him no answer, but,\r\ntrotting on to the point where the rides met, stopped a moment and\r\nlistened carefully. Then he took a path diverging away from that by\r\nwhich the huntsmen and the crowd of horsemen had gone, and made the\r\nbest of his way through the wood. At the end of this he came upon Sir\r\nWilliam, who, with no one near him but his servant, was standing in\r\nthe pathway of a little hunting-gate.\r\n\r\n"Hold hard," said Sir William. "The hounds are not out of the wood\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Is the fox away, sir?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of that if we can\'t get the hounds out?--Yes, he\'s\r\naway. He passed out where I\'m standing." And then he began to blow\r\nhis horn lustily, and by degrees other men and a few hounds came down\r\nthe ride. Then Tom, with his horse almost blown, made his appearance\r\noutside the wood, and soon there came a rush of men, nearly on the\r\ntop of one another, pushing on, not knowing whither, but keenly alive\r\nto the fact that the fox had at last consented to move his quarters.\r\n\r\nTom touched his hat, and looked at his master, inquiringly. "He\'s\r\ngone for Claydon\'s," said the master. "Try them up that hedgerow."\r\nTom did try them up the hedgerow, and in half a minute the hounds\r\ncame upon the scent. Then you might see men settling their hats on\r\ntheir heads, and feeling their feet in the stirrups. The moment for\r\nwhich they had so long waited had come, and yet there were many\r\nwho would now have preferred that the fox should be headed back\r\ninto cover. Some had but little confidence in their half-blown\r\nhorses;--with many the waiting, though so abused and anathematized,\r\nwas in truth more to their taste than the run itself;--with others\r\nthe excitement had gone by, and a gallop over a field or two was\r\nnecessary before it would be restored. With most men at such a moment\r\nthere is a little nervousness, some fear of making a bad start, a\r\ndread lest others should have more of the success of the hunt than\r\nfalls to them. But there was a great rush and a mighty bustle as the\r\nhounds made out their game, and Sir William felt himself called upon\r\nto use the rough side of his tongue to more than one delinquent.\r\n\r\nAnd then certain sly old stagers might be seen turning off to the\r\nleft, instead of following the course of the game as indicated by the\r\nhounds. They were men who had felt the air as they came out, and knew\r\nthat the fox must soon run down wind, whatever he might do for the\r\nfirst half mile or so,--men who knew also which was the shortest way\r\nto Claydon\'s by the road. Ah, the satisfaction that there is when\r\nthese men are thrown out, and their dead knowledge proved to be of no\r\navail! If a fox will only run straight, heading from the cover on his\r\nreal line, these very sagacious gentlemen seldom come to much honour\r\nand glory.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance the beast seemed determined to go straight\r\nenough, for the hounds ran the scent along three or four hedgerows\r\nin a line. He had managed to get for himself full ten minutes\' start,\r\nand had been able to leave the cover and all his enemies well behind\r\nhim before he bethought himself as to his best way to his purposed\r\ndestination. And here, from field to field, there were little\r\nhunting-gates at which men crowded lustily, poking and shoving each\r\nother\'s horses, and hating each other with a bitterness of hatred\r\nwhich is, I think, known nowhere else. No hunting man ever wants\r\nto jump if he can help it, and the hedges near the gate were not\r\nalluring. A few there were who made lines for themselves, taking the\r\nnext field to the right, or scrambling through the corners of the\r\nfences while the rush was going on at the gates; and among these was\r\nGeorge Vavasor. He never rode in a crowd, always keeping himself\r\nsomewhat away from men as well as hounds. He would often be thrown\r\nout, and then men would hear no more of him for that day. On such\r\noccasions he did not show himself, as other men do, twenty minutes\r\nafter the fox had been killed or run to ground,--but betook himself\r\nhome by himself, going through the byeways and lanes, thus leaving no\r\nreport of his failure to be spoken of by his compeers.\r\n\r\nAs long as the line of gates lasted, the crowd continued as thick as\r\never, and the best man was he whose horse could shove the hardest.\r\nAfter passing some four or five fields in this way they came out\r\nupon a road, and, the scent holding strong, the dogs crossed it\r\nwithout any demurring. Then came doubt into the minds of men, many\r\nof whom, before they would venture away from their position on the\r\nlane, narrowly watched the leading hounds to see whether there was\r\nindication of a turn to the one side or the other. Sir William, whose\r\nseventy odd years excused him, turned sharp to the left, knowing that\r\nhe could make Claydon\'s that way; and very many were the submissive\r\nhorsemen who followed him; a few took the road to the right, having\r\nin their minds some little game of their own. The hardest riders\r\nthere had already crossed from the road into the country, and were\r\ngoing well to the hounds, ignorant, some of them, of the brook\r\nbefore them, and others unheeding. Foremost among these was Burgo\r\nFitzgerald,--Burgo Fitzgerald, whom no man had ever known to crane at\r\na fence, or to hug a road, or to spare his own neck or his horse\'s.\r\nAnd yet poor Burgo seldom finished well,--coming to repeated grief in\r\nthis matter of his hunting, as he did so constantly in other matters\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nBut almost neck and neck with Burgo was Pollock, the sporting\r\nliterary gentleman. Pollock had but two horses to his stud, and was\r\nnever known to give much money for them;--and he weighed without his\r\nboots, fifteen stones! No one ever knew how Pollock did it;--more\r\nespecially as all the world declared that he was as ignorant of\r\nhunting as any tailor. He could ride, or when he couldn\'t ride he\r\ncould tumble,--men said that of him,--and he would ride as long as\r\nthe beast under him could go. But few knew the sad misfortunes which\r\npoor Pollock sometimes encountered;--the muddy ditches in which he\r\nwas left; the despair with which he would stand by his unfortunate\r\nhorse when the poor brute could no longer move across some\r\ndeep-ploughed field; the miles that he would walk at night beside a\r\ntired animal, as he made his way slowly back to Roebury!\r\n\r\nThen came Tom the huntsman, with Calder Jones close to him, and\r\nGrindley intent on winning his sovereign. Vavasor had also crossed\r\nthe road somewhat to the left, carrying with him one or two who knew\r\nthat he was a safe man to follow. Maxwell had been ignominiously\r\nturned by the hedge, which, together with its ditch, formed a fence\r\nsuch as all men do not love at the beginning of a run. He had turned\r\nfrom it, acknowledging the cause. "By George!" said he, "that\'s too\r\nbig for me yet awhile; and there\'s no end of a river at the bottom."\r\nSo he had followed the master down the road.\r\n\r\nAll those whom we have named managed to get over the brook, Pollock\'s\r\nhorse barely contriving to get up his hind legs from the broken edge\r\nof the bank. Some nags refused it, and their riders thus lost all\r\ntheir chance of sport for that day. Such is the lot of men who hunt.\r\nA man pays five or six pounds for his day\'s amusement, and it is ten\r\nto one that the occurrences of the day disgust rather than gratify\r\nhim! One or two got in, and scrambled out on the other side, but\r\nTufto Pearlings, the Manchester man from Friday Street, stuck in the\r\nmud at the bottom, and could not get his mare out till seven men\r\nhad come with ropes to help him. "Where the devil is my fellow?"\r\nPearlings asked of the countrymen; but the countrymen could not tell\r\nhim that "his fellow" with his second horse was riding the hunt with\r\ngreat satisfaction to himself.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor found that his horse went with him uncommonly well,\r\ntaking his fences almost in the stride of his gallop, and giving\r\nunmistakeable signs of good condition. "I wonder what it is that\'s\r\namiss with him," said George to himself, resolving, however, that he\r\nwould sell him that day if he got an opportunity. Straight went the\r\nline of the fox, up from the brook, and Tom began to say that his\r\nmaster had been wrong about Claydon\'s.\r\n\r\n"Where are we now?" said Burgo, as four or five of them dashed\r\nthrough the open gate of a farmyard.\r\n\r\n"This is Bulby\'s farm," said Tom, "and we\'re going right away for\r\nElmham Wood."\r\n\r\n"Elmham Wood be d----," said a stout farmer, who had come as far as\r\nthat with them. "You won\'t see Elmham Wood to-day."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know best," said Tom; and then they were through the\r\nyard, across another road, and down a steep ravine by the side of a\r\nlittle copse. "He\'s been through them firs, any way," said Tom. "To\r\nhim, Gaylass!" Then up they went the other side of the ravine, and\r\nsaw the body of the hounds almost a field before them at the top.\r\n\r\n"I say,--that took some of the wind out of a fellow," said Pollock.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t mind about wind now," said Burgo, dashing on.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t the pace awful, coming up to that farmhouse?" said Calder\r\nJones, looking round to see if Grindley was shaken off. But Grindley,\r\nwith some six or seven others, was still there. And there, also,\r\nalways in the next field to the left, was George Vavasor. He had\r\nspoken no word to any one since the hunt commenced, nor had he wished\r\nto speak to any one. He desired to sell his horse,--and he desired\r\nalso to succeed in the run for other reasons than that, though I\r\nthink he would have found it difficult to define them.\r\n\r\nNow they had open grass land for about a mile, but with very heavy\r\nfences,--so that the hounds gained upon them a little, and Pollock\'s\r\nweight began to tell. The huntsman and Burgo were leading with some\r\nfortunate county gentleman whose good stars had brought him in upon\r\nthem at the farmyard gate. It is the injustice of such accidents as\r\nthis that breaks the heart of a man who has honestly gone through all\r\nthe heat and work of the struggle! And the hounds had veered a little\r\nround to the left, making, after all, for Claydon\'s. "Darned if the\r\nSquire warn\'t right," said Tom. Sir William, though a baronet, was\r\nfamiliarly called the Squire throughout the hunt.\r\n\r\n"We ain\'t going for Claydon\'s now?" asked Burgo.\r\n\r\n"Them\'s Claydon\'s beeches we sees over there," said Tom. "\'Tain\'t\r\noften the Squire\'s wrong."\r\n\r\nHere they came to a little double rail and a little quick-set hedge.\r\nA double rail is a nasty fence always if it has been made any way\r\nstrong, and one which a man with a wife and a family is justified in\r\navoiding. They mostly can be avoided, having gates; and this could\r\nhave been avoided. But Burgo never avoided anything, and went over\r\nit beautifully. The difficulty is to be discreet when the man before\r\none has been indiscreet. Tom went for the gate, as did Pollock, who\r\nknew that he could have no chance at the double rails. But Calder\r\nJones came to infinite grief, striking the top bar of the second rail,\r\nand going head-foremost out of his saddle, as though thrown by a\r\ncatapult. There we must leave him. Grindley, rejoicing greatly at\r\nthis discomfiture, made for the gate; but the country gentleman with\r\nthe fresh horse accomplished the rails, and was soon alongside of\r\nBurgo.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t see you at the start," said Burgo.\r\n\r\n"And I didn\'t see you," said the country gentleman; "so it\'s even."\r\n\r\nBurgo did not see the thing in the same light, but he said no more.\r\nGrindley and Tom were soon after them, Tom doing his utmost to shake\r\noff the attorney. Pollock was coming on also; but the pace had been\r\ntoo much for him, and though the ground rode light his poor beast\r\nlaboured and grunted sorely. The hounds were still veering somewhat\r\nto the left, and Burgo, jumping over a small fence into the same\r\nfield with them, saw that there was a horseman ahead of him. This was\r\nGeorge Vavasor, who was going well, without any symptom of distress.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were at Claydon\'s, having run over some seven miles of\r\nground in about thirty-five minutes. To those who do not know what\r\nhunting is, this pace does not seem very extraordinary; but it had\r\nbeen quite quick enough, as was testified by the horses which had\r\ngone the distance. Our party entered Claydon\'s Park at back, through\r\na gate in the park palings that was open on hunting days; but a much\r\nmore numerous lot was there almost as soon as them, who had come in\r\nby the main entrance. This lot was headed by Sir William, and our\r\nfriend Maxwell was with him.\r\n\r\n"A jolly thing so far," said Burgo to Maxwell; "about the best we\'ve\r\nhad this year."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t see a yard of it," said Maxwell. "I hadn\'t nerve to get off\r\nthe first road, and I haven\'t been off it ever since." Maxwell was a\r\nman who never lied about his hunting, or had the slightest shame in\r\nriding roads. "Who\'s been with you?" said he.\r\n\r\n"There\'ve been Tom and I;--and Calder Jones was there for a while.\r\nI think he killed himself somewhere. And there was Pollock, and your\r\nfriend Grindley, and a chap whose name I don\'t know who dropped out\r\nof heaven about half-way in the run; and there was another man whose\r\nback I saw just now; there he is,--by heavens, it\'s Vavasor! I didn\'t\r\nknow he was here."\r\n\r\nThey hung about the Claydon covers for ten minutes, and then their\r\nfox went off again,--their fox or another, as to which there was a\r\ngreat discussion afterwards; but he who would have suggested the\r\nidea of a new fox to Sir William would have been a bold man. A fox,\r\nhowever, went off, turning still to the left from Claydon\'s towards\r\nRoebury. Those ten minutes had brought up some fifty men; but it did\r\nnot bring up Calder Jones nor Tufto Pearlings, nor some half-dozen\r\nothers who had already come to serious misfortune; but Grindley was\r\nthere, very triumphant in his own success, and already talking of\r\nJones\'s sovereign. And Pollock was there also, thankful for the ten\r\nminutes\' law, and trusting that wind might be given to his horse to\r\nfinish the run triumphantly.\r\n\r\nBut the pace on leaving Claydon\'s was better than ever. This may have\r\ncome from the fact that the scent was keener, as they got out so\r\nclose upon their game. But I think they must have changed their fox.\r\nMaxwell, who saw him go, swore that he was fresh and clean. Burgo\r\nsaid that he knew it to be the same fox, but gave no reason. "Same\r\nfox! in course it was; why shouldn\'t it be the same?" said Tom. The\r\ncountry gentleman who had dropped from heaven was quite sure that\r\nthey had changed, and so were most of those who had ridden the road.\r\nPollock confined himself to hoping that he might soon be killed, and\r\nthat thus his triumph for the day might be assured.\r\n\r\nOn they went, and the pace soon became too good for the poor author.\r\nHis horse at last refused a little hedge, and there was not another\r\ntrot to be got out of him. That night Pollock turned up at Roebury\r\nabout nine o\'clock, very hungry,--and it was known that his animal\r\nwas alive;--but the poor horse ate not a grain of oats that night,\r\nnor on the next morning. Vavasor had again taken a line to himself,\r\non this occasion a little to the right of the meet; but Maxwell\r\nfollowed him and rode close with him to the end. Burgo for a while\r\nstill led the body of the field, incurring at first much condemnation\r\nfrom Sir William,--nominally for hurrying on among the hounds, but in\r\ntruth because he got before Sir William himself. During this latter\r\npart of the run Sir William stuck to the hounds in spite of his\r\nseventy odd years. Going down into Marham Bottom, some four or five\r\nwere left behind, for they feared the soft ground near the river, and\r\ndid not know the pass through it. But Sir William knew it, and those\r\nwho remained close to him got over that trouble. Burgo, who would\r\nstill lead, nearly foundered in the bog;--but he was light, and his\r\nhorse pulled him through,--leaving a fore-shoe in the mud. After that\r\nBurgo was contented to give Sir William the lead.\r\n\r\nThen they came up by Marham Pits to Cleshey Small Wood, which they\r\npassed without hanging there a minute, and over the grass lands of\r\nCleshey Farm. Here Vavasor and Maxwell joined the others, having\r\ngained some three hundred yards in distance by their course, but\r\nhaving been forced to jump the Marham Stream which Sir William had\r\nforded. The pace now was as good as the horses could make it,--and\r\nperhaps something better as regarded some of them. Sir William\'s\r\nservant had been with him, and he had got his second horse at\r\nClaydon\'s; Maxwell had been equally fortunate; Tom\'s second horse\r\nhad not come up, and his beast was in great distress; Grindley had\r\nremained behind at Marham Bottom, being contented perhaps with having\r\nbeaten Calder Jones,--from whom by-the-by I may here declare that he\r\nnever got his sovereign. Burgo, Vavasor, and the country gentleman\r\nstill held on; but it was devoutly desired by all of them that the\r\nfox might soon come to the end of his tether. Ah! that intense\r\nlonging that the fox may fail, when the failings of the horse begin\r\nto make themselves known,--and the consciousness comes on that all\r\nthat one has done will go for nothing unless the thing can be brought\r\nto a close in a field or two! So far you have triumphed, leaving\r\nscores of men behind; but of what good is all that, if you also are\r\nto be left behind at the last?\r\n\r\nIt was manifest now to all who knew the country that the fox was\r\nmaking for Thornden Deer Park, but Thornden Deer Park was still two\r\nmiles ahead of them, and the hounds were so near to their game that\r\nthe poor beast could hardly hope to live till he got there. He had\r\ntried a well-known drain near Cleshey Farm House; but it had been\r\ninhospitably, nay cruelly, closed against him. Soon after that he\r\nthrew himself down in a ditch, and the eager hounds overran him,\r\ngiving him a moment\'s law,--and giving also a moment\'s law to horses\r\nthat wanted it as badly. "I\'m about done for," said Burgo to Maxwell.\r\n"Luckily for you," said Maxwell, "the fox is much in the same way."\r\n\r\nBut the fox had still more power left in him than poor Burgo\r\nFitzgerald\'s horse. He gained a minute\'s check and then he started\r\nagain, being viewed away by Sir William himself. The country\r\ngentleman of whom mention has been made also viewed him, and holloa\'d\r\nas he did so: "Yoicks, tally; gone away!" The unfortunate man! "What\r\nthe d---- are you roaring at?" said Sir William. "Do you suppose\r\nI don\'t know where the fox is?" Whereupon the country gentleman\r\nretreated, and became less conspicuous than he had been.\r\n\r\nAway they went again, off Cleshey and into Thornden parish, on the\r\nland of Sorrel Farm,--a spot well to be remembered by one or two ever\r\nafterwards. Here Sir William made for a gate which took him a little\r\nout of the line, but Maxwell and Burgo Fitzgerald, followed by\r\nVavasor, went straight ahead. There was a huge ditch and boundary\r\nbank there which Sir William had known and had avoided. Maxwell,\r\nwhose pluck had returned to him at last, took it well. His horse was\r\ncomparatively fresh and made nothing of it. Then came poor Burgo!\r\nOh, Burgo, hadst thou not have been a very child, thou shouldst have\r\nknown that now, at this time of the day,--after all that thy gallant\r\nhorse had done for thee,--it was impossible to thee or him. But when\r\ndid Burgo Fitzgerald know anything? He rode at the bank as though it\r\nhad been the first fence of the day, striking his poor beast with his\r\nspurs, as though muscle, strength, and new power could be imparted by\r\ntheir rowels. The animal rose at the bank and in some way got upon\r\nit, scrambling as he struck it with his chest, and then fell headlong\r\ninto the ditch at the other side, a confused mass of head, limbs, and\r\nbody. His career was at an end, and he had broken his heart! Poor\r\nnoble beast, noble in vain! To his very last gasp he had done his\r\nbest, and had deserved that he should have been in better hands. His\r\nmaster\'s ignorance had killed him. There are men who never know how\r\nlittle a horse can do,--or how much!\r\n\r\nThere was to some extent a gap in the fence when Maxwell had first\r\nridden it and Burgo had followed him; a gap, or break in the hedge at\r\nthe top, indicating plainly the place at which a horse could best get\r\nover. To this spot Vavasor followed, and was on the bank at Burgo\'s\r\nheels before he knew what had happened. But the man had got away and\r\nonly the horse lay there in the ditch. "Are you hurt?" said Vavasor;\r\n"can I do anything?" But he did not stop, "If you can find a chap\r\njust send him to me," said Burgo in a melancholy tone. Then he sat\r\ndown, with his feet in the ditch, and looked at the carcase of his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThere was no more need of jumping that day. The way was open into the\r\nnext field,--a turnip field,--and there amidst the crisp breaking\r\nturnip-tops, with the breath of his enemies hot upon him, with their\r\nsharp teeth at his entrails, biting at them impotently in the agonies\r\nof his death struggle, poor Reynard finished his career. Maxwell was\r\ncertainly the first there,--but Sir William and George Vavasor were\r\nclose upon him. That taking of brushes of which we used to hear is\r\na little out of fashion; but if such honour were due to any one it\r\nwas due to Vavasor, for he and he only had ridden the hunt throughout.\r\nBut he claimed no honour, and none was specially given to him. He\r\nand Maxwell rode homewards together, having sent assistance to poor\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald; and as they went along the road, saying but little\r\nto each other, Maxwell, in a very indifferent voice, asked him a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"What do you want for that horse, Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"A hundred and fifty," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s mine," said Maxwell. So the brown horse was sold for about half\r\nhis value, because he had brought with him a bad character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor\'s Great Relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald, of whose hunting experiences something has been\r\ntold in the last chapter, was a young man born in the purple of the\r\nEnglish aristocracy. He was related to half the dukes in the kingdom,\r\nand had three countesses for his aunts. When he came of age he was\r\nmaster of a sufficient fortune to make it quite out of the question\r\nthat he should be asked to earn his bread; and though that, and other\r\nwindfalls that had come to him, had long since been spent, no one\r\nhad ever made to him so ridiculous a proposition as that. He was now\r\nthirty, and for some years past had been known to be much worse than\r\npenniless; but still he lived on in the same circles, still slept\r\nsoftly and drank of the best, and went about with his valet and his\r\ngroom and his horses, and fared sumptuously every day. Some people\r\nsaid the countesses did it for him, and some said that it was the\r\ndukes;--while others, again, declared that the Jews were his most\r\ngenerous friends. At any rate he still seemed to live as he had\r\nalways lived, setting tradesmen at defiance, and laughing to scorn\r\nall the rules which regulate the lives of other men.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen months before the time of which I am now speaking,\r\na great chance had come in this young man\'s way, and he had almost\r\nsucceeded in making himself one of the richest men in England. There\r\nhad been then a great heiress in the land, on whom the properties of\r\nhalf-a-dozen ancient families had concentrated; and Burgo, who in\r\nspite of his iniquities still kept his position in the drawing-rooms\r\nof the great, had almost succeeded in obtaining the hand and the\r\nwealth,--as people still said that he had obtained the heart,--of the\r\nLady Glencora M\'Cluskie. But sundry mighty magnates, driven almost\r\nto despair at the prospect of such a sacrifice, had sagaciously\r\nput their heads together, and the result had been that the Lady\r\nGlencora had heard reason. She had listened,--with many haughty\r\ntossings indeed of her proud little head, with many throbbings of her\r\npassionate young heart; but in the end she listened and heard reason.\r\nShe saw Burgo, for the last time, and told him that she was the\r\npromised bride of Plantagenet Palliser, nephew and heir of the Duke\r\nof Omnium.\r\n\r\nHe had borne it like a man,--never having groaned openly, or quivered\r\nonce before any comrade at the name of the Lady Glencora. She had\r\nmarried Mr. Palliser at St. George\'s Square, and on the morning of the\r\nmarriage he had hung about his club door in Pall Mall, listening to\r\nthe bells, and saying a word or two about the wedding, with admirable\r\ncourage. It had been for him a great chance,--and he had lost it.\r\nWho can say, too, that his only regret was for the money? He had\r\nspoken once of it to a married sister of his, in whose house he had\r\nfirst met Lady Glencora. "I shall never marry now,--that is all,"\r\nhe said--and then he went about, living his old reckless life, with\r\nthe same recklessness as ever. He was one of those young men with\r\ndark hair and blue eyes,--who wear no beard, and are certainly among\r\nthe handsomest of all God\'s creatures. No more handsome man than\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald lived in his days; and this merit at any rate was\r\nhis,--that he thought nothing of his own beauty. But he lived ever\r\nwithout conscience, without purpose,--with no idea that it behoved\r\nhim as a man to do anything but eat and drink,--or ride well to\r\nhounds till some poor brute, much nobler than himself, perished\r\nbeneath him.\r\n\r\nHe chiefly concerns our story at this present time because the Lady\r\nGlencora who had loved him,--and would have married him had not those\r\nsagacious heads prevented it,--was a cousin of Alice Vavasor\'s. She\r\nwas among those very great relations with whom Alice was connected by\r\nher mother\'s side,--being indeed so near to Lady Macleod, that she\r\nwas first cousin to that lady, only once removed. Lady Midlothian\r\nwas aunt to the Lady Glencora, and our Alice might have called\r\ncousins, and not been forbidden, with the old Lord of the Isles, Lady\r\nGlencora\'s father,--who was dead, however, some time previous to that\r\naffair with Burgo,--and with the Marquis of Auld Reekie, who was\r\nLady Glencora\'s uncle, and had been her guardian. But Alice had kept\r\nherself aloof from her grand relations on her mother\'s side, choosing\r\nrather to hold herself as belonging to those who were her father\'s\r\nkindred. With Lady Glencora, however, she had for a short time--for\r\nsome week or ten days,--been on terms of almost affectionate\r\nintimacy. It had been then, when the wayward heiress with the bright\r\nwaving locks had been most strongly minded to give herself and her\r\nwealth to Burgo Fitzgerald. Burgo had had money dealings with George\r\nVavasor, and knew him,--knew him intimately, and had learned the\r\nfact of his cousinship between the heiress and his friend\'s cousin.\r\nWhereupon in the agony of those weeks in which the sagacious heads\r\nwere resisting her love, Lady Glencora came to her cousin in Queen\r\nAnne Street, and told Alice all that tale. "Was Alice," she asked,\r\n"afraid of the marquises and the countesses, or of all the rank and\r\nall the money which they boasted?" Alice answered that she was not at\r\nall afraid of them. "Then would she permit Lady Glencora and Burgo\r\nto see each other in the drawing-room at Queen Anne Street, just\r\nonce!" Just once,--so that they might arrange that little plan of an\r\nelopement. But Alice could not do that for her newly found cousin.\r\nShe endeavoured to explain that it was not the dignity of the\r\nsagacious heads which stood in her way, but her woman\'s feeling of\r\nwhat was right and wrong in such a matter.\r\n\r\n"Why should I not marry him?" said Lady Glencora, with her eyes\r\nflashing. "He is my equal."\r\n\r\nAlice explained that she had no word to say against such a marriage.\r\nShe counselled her cousin to be true to her love if her love was in\r\nitself true. But she, an unmarried woman, who had hitherto not known\r\nher cousin, might not give such help as that! "If you will not help\r\nme, I am helpless!" said the Lady Glencora, and then she kneeled at\r\nAlice\'s knees and threw her wavy locks abroad on Alice\'s lap. "How\r\nshall I bribe you?" said Lady Glencora. "Next to him I will love you\r\nbetter than all the world." But Alice, though she kissed the fair\r\nforehead and owned that such reward would be worth much to her, could\r\nnot take any bribe for such a cause. Then Lady Glencora had been\r\nangry with her, calling her heartless, and threatening her that she\r\ntoo might have sorrow of her own and want assistance. Alice told\r\nnothing of her own tale,--how she had loved her cousin and had been\r\nforced to give him up, but said what kind words she could, and she\r\nof the waving hair and light blue eyes had been pacified. Then she\r\nhad come again,--had come daily while the sagacious heads were at\r\nwork,--and Alice in her trouble had been a comfort to her.\r\n\r\nBut the sagacious heads were victorious, as we know, and Lady\r\nGlencora M\'Cluskie became Lady Glencora Palliser with all the\r\npropriety in the world, instead of becoming wife to poor Burgo, with\r\nall imaginable impropriety. And then she wrote a letter to Alice,\r\nvery short and rather sad; but still with a certain sweetness in it.\r\n"She had been counselled that it was not fitting for her to love as\r\nshe had thought to love, and she had resolved to give up her dream.\r\nHer cousin Alice, she knew, would respect her secret. She was going\r\nto become the wife of the best man, she thought, in all the world;\r\nand it should be the one care of her life to make him happy." She\r\nsaid not a word in all her letter of loving this newly found lord.\r\n"She was to be married at once. Would Alice be one among the bevy of\r\nbridesmaids who were to grace the ceremony?"\r\n\r\nAlice wished her joy heartily,--"heartily," she said, but had\r\ndeclined that office of bridesmaid. She did not wish to undergo the\r\ncold looks of the Lady Julias and Lady Janes who all would know each\r\nother, but none of whom would know her. So she sent her cousin a\r\nlittle ring, and asked her to keep it amidst all the wealthy tribute\r\nof marriage gifts which would be poured forth at her feet.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to this present Alice had heard no more of Lady\r\nGlencora. She had been married late in the preceding season and\r\nhad gone away with Mr. Palliser, spending her honeymoon amidst the\r\nsoftnesses of some Italian lake. They had not returned to England\r\ntill the time had come for them to encounter the magnificent\r\nChristmas festivities of Mr. Palliser\'s uncle, the Duke. On this\r\noccasion Gatherum Castle, the vast palace which the Duke had built at\r\na cost of nearly a quarter of a million, was opened, as it had never\r\nbeen opened before;--for the Duke\'s heir had married to the Duke\'s\r\nliking, and the Duke was a man who could do such things handsomely\r\nwhen he was well pleased. Then there had been a throng of bridal\r\nguests, and a succession of bridal gaieties which had continued\r\nthemselves even past the time at which Mr. Palliser was due at\r\nWestminster;--and Mr. Palliser was a legislator who served his\r\ncountry with the utmost assiduity. So the London season commenced,\r\nprogressed, and was consumed; and still Alice heard nothing more of\r\nher friend and cousin Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nBut this had troubled her not at all. A chance circumstance, the\r\nstory of which she had told to no one, had given her a short intimacy\r\nwith this fair child of the gold mines, but she had felt that they\r\ntwo could not live together in habits of much intimacy. She had, when\r\nthinking of the young bride, only thought of that wild love episode\r\nin the girl\'s life. It had been strange to her that she should in\r\none week have listened to the most passionate protestations from her\r\nfriend of love for one man, and then have been told in the next that\r\nanother man was to be her friend\'s husband! But she reflected that\r\nher own career was much the same,--only with the interval of some\r\nlonger time.\r\n\r\nBut her own career was not the same. Glencora had married Mr.\r\nPalliser,--had married him without pausing to doubt;--but Alice had\r\ngone on doubting till at last she had resolved that she would not\r\nmarry Mr. Grey. She thought of this much in those days at Cheltenham,\r\nand wondered often whether Glencora lived with her husband in the\r\nfull happiness of conjugal love.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about three days after Mr. Grey\'s visit, there came to\r\nher two letters, as to neither of which did she know the writer by\r\nthe handwriting. Lady Macleod had told her,--with some hesitation,\r\nindeed, for Lady Macleod was afraid of her,--but had told her,\r\nnevertheless, more than once, that those noble relatives had heard of\r\nthe treatment to which Mr. Grey was being subjected, and had expressed\r\ntheir great sorrow,--if not dismay or almost anger. Lady Macleod,\r\nindeed, had gone as far as she dared, and might have gone further\r\nwithout any sacrifice of truth. Lady Midlothian had said that it\r\nwould be disgraceful to the family, and Lady Glencora\'s aunt, the\r\nMarchioness of Auld Reekie, had demanded to be told what it was the\r\ngirl wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the letters came Lady Macleod was not present, and I am disposed\r\nto think that one of them had been written by concerted arrangement\r\nwith her. But if so she had not dared to watch the immediate effect\r\nof her own projectile. This one was from Lady Midlothian. Of the\r\nother Lady Macleod certainly knew nothing, though it also had sprung\r\nout of the discussions which had taken place as to Alice\'s sins in\r\nthe Auld Reekie-Midlothian set. This other letter was from Lady\r\nGlencora. Alice opened the two, one without reading the other, very\r\nslowly. Lady Midlothian\'s was the first opened, and then came a spot\r\nof anger on Alice\'s cheeks as she saw the signature, and caught a\r\nword or two as she allowed her eye to glance down the page. Then she\r\nopened the other, which was shorter, and when she saw her cousin\'s\r\nsignature, "Glencora Palliser," she read that letter first,--read it\r\ntwice before she went back to the disagreeable task of perusing Lady\r\nMidlothian\'s lecture. The reader shall have both the letters, but\r\nthat from the Countess shall have precedence.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Castle Reekie, N.B.\r\n   -- Oct. 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MISS VAVASOR,\r\n\r\n   I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally, though\r\n   I have heard of you very often from our dear mutual friend\r\n   and relative Lady Macleod, with whom I understand that\r\n   you are at present on a visit. Your grandmother,--by\r\n   the mother\'s side,--Lady Flora Macleod, and my mother\r\n   the Countess of Leith, were half-sisters; and though\r\n   circumstances since that have prevented our seeing so much\r\n   of each other as is desirable, I have always remembered\r\n   the connection, and have ever regarded you as one in\r\n   whose welfare I am bound by ties of blood to take a warm\r\n   interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n"\'Since that!\'--what does she mean by \'since that\'?" said Alice to\r\nherself. "She has never set eyes on me at all. Why does she talk of\r\nnot having seen as much of me as is desirable?"\r\n\r\n\r\n   I had learned with great gratification that you were going\r\n   to be married to a most worthy gentleman, Mr. John Grey of\r\n   Nethercoats, in Cambridgeshire. When I first heard this\r\n   I made it my business to institute some inquiries, and I\r\n   was heartily glad to find that your choice had done you\r\n   so much credit. [If the reader has read Alice\'s character\r\n   as I have meant it should be read, it will thoroughly be\r\n   understood that this was wormwood to her.] I was informed\r\n   that Mr. Grey is in every respect a gentleman,--that he is\r\n   a man of most excellent habits, and one to whom any young\r\n   woman could commit her future happiness with security,\r\n   that his means are very good for his position, and that\r\n   there was no possible objection to such a marriage. All\r\n   this gave great satisfaction to me, in which I was joined\r\n   by the Marchioness of Auld Reekie, who is connected with\r\n   you almost as nearly as I am, and who, I can assure you,\r\n   feels a considerable interest in your welfare. I am\r\n   staying with her now, and in all that I say, she agrees\r\n   with me.\r\n\r\n   You may feel then how dreadfully we were dismayed when\r\n   we were told by dear Lady Macleod that you had told Mr.\r\n   Grey that you intended to change your mind! My dear Miss\r\n   Vavasor, can this be true? There are things in which a\r\n   young lady has no right to change her mind after it has\r\n   been once made up; and certainly when a young lady has\r\n   accepted a gentleman, that is one of them. He cannot\r\n   legally make you become his wife, but he has a right to\r\n   claim you before God and man. Have you considered that he\r\n   has probably furnished his house in consequence of his\r\n   intended marriage,--and perhaps in compliance with your\r\n   own especial wishes? [I think that Lady Macleod must have\r\n   told the Countess something that she had heard about the\r\n   garden.] Have you reflected that he has of course told all\r\n   his friends? Have you any reason to give? I am told, none!\r\n   Nothing should ever be done without a reason; much less\r\n   such a thing as this in which your own interests and,\r\n   I may say, respectability are involved. I hope you will\r\n   think of this before you persist in destroying your own\r\n   happiness and perhaps that of a very worthy man.\r\n\r\n   I had heard, some years ago, when you were much younger,\r\n   that you had become imprudently attached in another\r\n   direction--with a gentleman with none of those qualities\r\n   to recommend him which speak so highly for Mr. Grey.\r\n   It would grieve me very much, as it would also the\r\n   Marchioness, who in this matter thinks exactly as I do, if\r\n   I were led to suppose that your rejection of Mr. Grey had\r\n   been caused by _any renewal of that project_. Nothing, my\r\n   dear Miss Vavasor, could be more unfortunate,--and I might\r\n   almost add a stronger word.\r\n\r\n   I have been advised that a line from me as representing\r\n   your poor mother\'s family, especially as I have at\r\n   the present moment the opportunity of expressing Lady\r\n   Auld Reekie\'s sentiments as well as my own, might be\r\n   of service. I implore you, my dear Miss Vavasor, to\r\n   remember what you owe to God and man, and to carry out an\r\n   engagement made by yourself, that is in all respects comme\r\n   il faut, and which will give entire satisfaction to your\r\n   friends and relatives.\r\n\r\n   MARGARET M. MIDLOTHIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that Lady Macleod had been wrong in supposing that this could\r\ndo any good. She should have known Alice better; and should also\r\nhave known the world better. But her own reverence for her own noble\r\nrelatives was so great that she could not understand, even yet, that\r\nall such feeling was wanting to her niece. It was to her impossible\r\nthat the expressed opinion of such an one as the Countess of\r\nMidlothian, owning her relationship and solicitude, and condescending\r\nat the same time to express friendship,--she could not, I say,\r\nunderstand that the voice of such an one, so speaking, should have no\r\nweight whatever. But I think that she had been quite right in keeping\r\nout of Alice\'s way at the moment of the arrival of the letter. Alice\r\nread it, slowly, and then replacing it in its envelope, leaned back\r\nquietly in her chair,--with her eyes fixed upon the teapot on the\r\ntable. She had, however, the other letter on which to occupy her\r\nmind, and thus relieve her from the effects of too deep an animosity\r\nagainst the Countess.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Glencora\'s letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Matching Priory,\r\n   Thursday.\r\n\r\n   DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n   I have just come home from Scotland, where they have been\r\n   telling me something of your little troubles. I had little\r\n   troubles once too, and you were so good to me! Will you\r\n   come to us here for a few weeks? We shall be here till\r\n   Christmas-time, when we go somewhere else. I have told my\r\n   husband that you are a great friend of mine as well as a\r\n   cousin, and that he must be good to you. He is very quiet,\r\n   and works very hard at politics; but I think you will like\r\n   him. Do come! There will be a good many people here, so\r\n   that you will not find it dull. If you will name the day\r\n   we will send the carriage for you at Matching Station, and\r\n   I dare say I can manage to come myself.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n   G. PALLISER.\r\n\r\n   P.S. I know what will be in your mind. You will say, why\r\n   did not she come to me in London? She knew the way to\r\n   Queen Anne Street well enough. Dear Alice, don\'t say that.\r\n   Believe me, I had much to do and think of in London. And\r\n   if I was wrong, yet you will forgive me. Mr. Palliser says\r\n   I am to give you his love,--as being a cousin,--and say\r\n   that you must come!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was certainly better than the other, but Alice, on\r\nreading it, came to a resolve that she would not accept the\r\ninvitation. In the first place, even that allusion to her little\r\ntroubles jarred upon her feelings; and then she thought that her\r\nrejection of Mr. Grey could be no special reason why she should go to\r\nMatching Priory. Was it not very possible that she had been invited\r\nthat she might meet Lady Midlothian there, and encounter all the\r\nstrength of a personal battery from the Countess? Lady Glencora\'s\r\nletter she would of course answer, but to Lady Midlothian she would\r\nnot condescend to make any reply whatever.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock Lady Macleod came down to her. For half-an-hour\r\nor so Alice said nothing; nor did Lady Macleod ask any question. She\r\nlooked inquisitively at Alice, eyeing the letter which was lying by\r\nthe side of her niece\'s workbasket, but she said no word about Mr.\r\nGrey or the Countess. At last Alice spoke.\r\n\r\n"Aunt," she said, "I have had a letter this morning from your friend,\r\nLady Midlothian."\r\n\r\n"She is my cousin, Alice; and yours as much as mine."\r\n\r\n"Your cousin then, aunt. But it is of more moment that she is your\r\nfriend. She certainly is not mine, nor can her cousinship afford any\r\njustification for her interfering in my affairs."\r\n\r\n"Alice,--from her position--"\r\n\r\n"Her position can be nothing to me, aunt. I will not submit to it.\r\nThere is her letter, which you can read if you please. After that you\r\nmay burn it. I need hardly say that I shall not answer it."\r\n\r\n"And what am I to say to her, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing from me, aunt;--from yourself, whatever you please, of\r\ncourse." Then there was silence between them for a few minutes.\r\n"And I have had another letter, from Lady Glencora, who married Mr.\r\nPalliser, and whom I knew in London last spring."\r\n\r\n"And has that offended you, too?"\r\n\r\n"No, there is no offence in that. She asks me to go and see her at\r\nMatching Priory, her husband\'s house; but I shall not go."\r\n\r\nBut at last Alice agreed to pay this visit, and it may be as well\r\nto explain here how she was brought to do so. She wrote to Lady\r\nGlencora, declining, and explaining frankly that she did decline,\r\nbecause she thought it probable that she might there meet Lady\r\nMidlothian. Lady Midlothian, she said, had interfered very\r\nunwarrantably in her affairs, and she did not wish to make her\r\nacquaintance. To this Lady Glencora replied, post haste, that she had\r\nintended no such horrid treachery as that for Alice; that neither\r\nwould Lady Midlothian be there, nor any of that set; by which\r\nAlice knew that Lady Glencora referred specially to her aunt the\r\nMarchioness; that no one would be at Matching who could torment\r\nAlice, either with right or without it, "except so far as I myself\r\nmay do so," Lady Glencora said; and then she named an early day in\r\nNovember, at which she would herself undertake to meet Alice at the\r\nMatching Station. On receipt of this letter, Alice, after two days\'\r\ndoubt, accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTribute from Oileymead.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Vavasor, in writing to her cousin Alice, felt some little\r\ndifficulty in excusing herself for remaining in Norfolk with Mrs.\r\nGreenow. She had laughed at Mrs. Greenow before she went to Yarmouth,\r\nand had laughed at herself for going there. And in all her letters\r\nsince, she had spoken of her aunt as a silly, vain, worldly woman,\r\nweeping crocodile tears, for an old husband whose death had released\r\nher from the tedium of his company, and spreading lures to catch new\r\nlovers. But yet she agreed to stay with her aunt, and remain with her\r\nin lodgings at Norwich for a month.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Greenow had about her something more than Kate had\r\nacknowledged when she first attempted to read her aunt\'s character.\r\nShe was clever, and in her own way persuasive. She was very generous,\r\nand possessed a certain power of making herself pleasant to those\r\naround her. In asking Kate to stay with her she had so asked as to\r\nmake it appear that Kate was to confer the favour. She had told her\r\nniece that she was all alone in the world. "I have money," she had\r\nsaid, with more appearance of true feeling than Kate had observed\r\nbefore. "I have money, but I have nothing else in the world. I have\r\nno home. Why should I not remain here in Norfolk, where I know a few\r\npeople? If you\'ll say that you\'ll go anywhere else with me, I\'ll go\r\nto any place you\'ll name." Kate had believed this to be hardly true.\r\nShe had felt sure that her aunt wished to remain in the neighbourhood\r\nof her seaside admirers; but, nevertheless, she had yielded, and at\r\nthe end of October the two ladies, with Jeannette, settled themselves\r\nin comfortable lodgings within the precincts of the Close at Norwich.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenow at this time had been dead very nearly six months, but his\r\nwidow made some mistakes in her dates and appeared to think that the\r\ninterval had been longer. On the day of their arrival at Norwich it\r\nwas evident that this error had confirmed itself in her mind. "Only\r\nthink," she said, as she unpacked a little miniature of the departed\r\none, and sat with it for a moment in her hands, as she pressed her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes, "only think, that it is barely nine months\r\nsince he was with me?"\r\n\r\n"Six, you mean, aunt," said Kate, unadvisedly.\r\n\r\n"Only nine months" repeated Mrs. Greenow, as though she had not heard\r\nher niece. "Only nine months!" After that Kate attempted to correct\r\nno more such errors. "It happened in May, Miss," Jeannette said\r\nafterwards to Miss Vavasor, "and that, as we reckons, it will be just\r\na twelvemonth come Christmas." But Kate paid no attention to this.\r\n\r\nAnd Jeannette was very ungrateful, and certainly should have indulged\r\nherself in no such sarcasms. When Mrs. Greenow made a slight change in\r\nher mourning, which she did on her arrival at Norwich, using a little\r\nlace among her crapes, Jeannette reaped a rich harvest in gifts of\r\nclothes. Mrs. Greenow knew well enough that she expected more from\r\na servant than mere service;--that she wanted loyalty, discretion,\r\nand perhaps sometimes a little secrecy;--and as she paid for these\r\nthings, she should have had them.\r\n\r\nKate undertook to stay a month with her aunt at Norwich, and Mrs.\r\nGreenow undertook that Mr. Cheesacre should declare himself as Kate\'s\r\nlover, before the expiration of the month. It was in vain that Kate\r\nprotested that she wanted no such lover, and that she would certainly\r\nreject him if he came. "That\'s all very well, my dear," Aunt Greenow\r\nwould say. "A girl must settle herself some day, you know;--and you\'d\r\nhave it all your own way at Oileymead."\r\n\r\nBut the offer certainly showed much generosity on the part of Aunt\r\nGreenow, inasmuch as Mr. Cheesacre\'s attentions were apparently paid\r\nto herself rather than to her niece. Mr. Cheesacre was very attentive.\r\nHe had taken the lodgings in the Close, and had sent over fowls and\r\ncream from Oileymead, and had called on the morning after their\r\narrival; but in all his attentions he distinguished the aunt more\r\nparticularly than the niece. "I am all for Mr. Cheesacre, Miss,"\r\nsaid Jeannette once. "The Captain is perhaps the nicerer-looking\r\ngentleman, and he ain\'t so podgy like; but what\'s good looks if a\r\ngentleman hasn\'t got nothing? I can\'t abide anything that\'s poor;\r\nneither can\'t Missus." From which it was evident that Jeannette gave\r\nMiss Vavasor no credit in having Mr. Cheesacre in her train.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bellfield was also at Norwich, having obtained some\r\nquasi-military employment there in the matter of drilling volunteers.\r\nCertain capacities in that line it may be supposed that he possessed,\r\nand, as his friend Cheesacre said of him, he was going to earn an\r\nhonest penny once in his life. The Captain and Mr. Cheesacre had made\r\nup any little differences that had existed between them at Yarmouth,\r\nand were close allies again when they left that place. Some little\r\ncompact on matters of business must have been arranged between\r\nthem,--for the Captain was in funds again. He was in funds again\r\nthrough the liberality of his friend,--and no payment of former loans\r\nhad been made, nor had there been any speech of such. Mr. Cheesacre\r\nhad drawn his purse-strings liberally, and had declared that if all\r\nwent well the hospitality of Oileymead should not be wanting during\r\nthe winter. Captain Bellfield had nodded his head and declared that\r\nall should go well.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t see much of the Captain, I suppose," said Mr. Cheesacre to\r\nMrs. Greenow on the morning of the day after her arrival at Norwich.\r\nHe had come across the whole way from Oileymead to ask her if she\r\nfound herself comfortable,--and perhaps with an eye to the Norwich\r\nmarkets at the same time. He now wore a pair of black riding boots\r\nover his trousers, and a round topped hat, and looked much more at\r\nhome than he had done by the seaside.\r\n\r\n"Not much, I dare say," said the widow. "He tells me that he must be\r\non duty ten or twelve hours a day. Poor fellow!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deuced good thing for him, and he ought to be very much\r\nobliged to me for putting him in the way of getting it. But he told\r\nme to tell you that if he didn\'t call, you were not to be angry with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no;--I shall remember, of course."\r\n\r\n"You see, if he don\'t work now he must come to grief. He hasn\'t got\r\na shilling that he can call his own."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he really?"\r\n\r\n"Not a shilling, Mrs. Greenow;--and then he\'s awfully in debt. He\r\nisn\'t a bad fellow, you know, only there\'s no trusting him for\r\nanything." Then after a few further inquiries that were almost\r\ntender, and a promise of further supplies from the dairy, Mr.\r\nCheesacre took his leave, almost forgetting to ask after Miss\r\nVavasor.\r\n\r\nBut as he left the house he had a word to say to Jeannette. "He\r\nhasn\'t been here, has he, Jenny?" "We haven\'t seen a sight of him\r\nyet, sir,--and I have thought it a little odd." Then Mr. Cheesacre\r\ngave the girl half-a-crown, and went his way. Jeannette, I think,\r\nmust have forgotten that the Captain had looked in after leaving his\r\nmilitary duties on the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nThe Captain\'s ten or twelve hours of daily work was performed,\r\nno doubt, at irregular intervals,--some days late and some days\r\nearly,--for he might be seen about Norwich almost at all times,\r\nduring the early part of that November;--and he might be very\r\noften seen going into the Close. In Norwich there are two weekly\r\nmarket-days, but on those days the Captain was no doubt kept more\r\nentirely to his military employment, for at such times he never\r\nwas seen near the Close. Now Mr. Cheesacre\'s visits to the town\r\nwere generally made on market-days, and so it happened that they\r\ndid not meet. On such occasions Mr. Cheesacre always was driven\r\nto Mrs. Greenow\'s door in a cab,--for he would come into town by\r\nrailway,--and he would deposit a basket bearing the rich produce of\r\nhis dairy. It was in vain that Mrs. Greenow protested against these\r\ngifts,--for she did protest and declared that if they were continued,\r\nthey would be sent back. They were, however, continued, and Mrs.\r\nGreenow was at her wits\' end about them. Cheesacre would not come\r\nup with them; but leaving them, would go about his business, and\r\nwould return to see the ladies. On such occasions he would be very\r\nparticular in getting his basket from Jeannette. As he did so he\r\nwould generally ask some question about the Captain, and Jeannette\r\nwould give him answers confidentially,--so that there was a strong\r\nfriendship between these two.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do about it?" said Mrs. Greenow, as Kate came into the\r\nsitting-room one morning, and saw on the table a small hamper lined\r\nwith a clean cloth. "It\'s as much as Jeannette has been able to\r\ncarry."\r\n\r\n"So it is, ma\'am,--quite; and I\'m strong in the arm, too, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do, Kate? He is such a good creature."\r\n\r\n"And he do admire you both so much," said Jeannette.\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t want to offend him for many reasons," said the\r\naunt, looking knowingly at her niece.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about your reasons, aunt, but if I were\r\nyou, I should leave the basket just as it is till he comes in the\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind seeing him yourself, Kate, and explaining to him that\r\nit won\'t do to get on in this way. Perhaps you wouldn\'t mind telling\r\nhim that if he\'ll promise not to bring any more, you won\'t object to\r\ntake this one."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, aunt, I can\'t do that. They\'re not brought to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kate!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, aunt;--I won\'t have you say so;--before Jeannette, too."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s for both, ma\'am; I do indeed. And there certainly ain\'t\r\nany cream to be bought like it in Norwich:--nor yet eggs."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what there is in the basket." And the widow lifted up\r\nthe corner of the cloth. "I declare if there isn\'t a turkey poult\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"My!" said Jeannette. "A turkey poult! Why, that\'s worth ten and\r\nsixpence in the market if it\'s worth a penny."\r\n\r\n"It\'s out of the question that I should take upon myself to say\r\nanything to him about it," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t, as well as I," said Mrs.\r\nGreenow.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what, ma\'am," said Jeannette: "let me just ask him who\r\nthey\'re for;--he\'ll tell me anything."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do anything of the kind, Jeannette," said Kate. "Of course,\r\naunt, they\'re brought for you. There\'s no doubt about that. A\r\ngentleman doesn\'t bring cream and turkeys to-- I\'ve never heard of\r\nsuch a thing!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why a gentleman shouldn\'t bring cream and turkeys to you\r\njust as well as to me. Indeed, he told me once as much himself."\r\n\r\n"Then, if they\'re for me, I\'ll leave them down outside the front\r\ndoor, and he may find his provisions there." And Kate proceeded to\r\nlift the basket off the table.\r\n\r\n"Leave it alone, Kate," said Mrs. Greenow, with a voice that was\r\nrather solemn; and which had, too, something of sadness in its tone.\r\n"Leave it alone. I\'ll see Mr. Cheesacre myself."\r\n\r\n"And I do hope you won\'t mention my name. It\'s the most absurd thing\r\nin the world. The man never spoke two dozen words to me in his life."\r\n\r\n"He speaks to me, though," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"I dare say he does," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"And about you, too, my dear."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t come here with those big flowers in his button-hole for\r\nnothing," said Jeannette,--"not if I knows what a gentleman means."\r\n\r\n"Of course he doesn\'t," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t object, aunt," said Kate, "I will write to grandpapa\r\nand tell him that I will return home at once."\r\n\r\n"What!--because of Mr. Cheesacre?" said Mrs. Greenow. "I don\'t think\r\nyou\'ll be so silly as that, my dear."\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion Mrs. Greenow undertook that she would see\r\nthe generous gentleman, and endeavour to stop the supplies from\r\nhis farmyard. It was well understood that he would call about four\r\no\'clock, when his business in the town would be over; and that he\r\nwould bring with him a little boy, who would carry away the basket.\r\nAt that hour Kate of course was absent, and the widow received\r\nMr. Cheesacre alone. The basket and cloth were there, in the\r\nsitting-room, and on the table were laid out the rich things which\r\nit had contained;--the turkey poult first, on a dish provided in the\r\nlodging-house, then a dozen fresh eggs in a soup plate, then the\r\ncream in a little tin can, which, for the last fortnight, had passed\r\nregularly between Oileymead and the house in the Close, and as to\r\nwhich Mr. Cheesacre was very pointed in his inquiries with Jeannette.\r\nThen behind the cream there were two or three heads of broccoli, and\r\na stick of celery as thick as a man\'s wrist. Altogether the tribute\r\nwas a very comfortable assistance to the housekeeping of a lady\r\nliving in a small way in lodgings.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre, when he saw the array on the long sofa-table, knew that\r\nhe was to prepare himself for some resistance; but that resistance\r\nwould give him, he thought, an opportunity of saying a few words that\r\nhe was desirous of speaking, and he did not altogether regret it. "I\r\njust called in," he said, "to see how you were."\r\n\r\n"We are not likely to starve," said Mrs. Greenow, pointing to the\r\ndelicacies from Oileymead.\r\n\r\n"Just a few trifles that my old woman asked me to bring in," said\r\nCheesacre. "She insisted on putting them up."\r\n\r\n"But your old woman is by far too magnificent," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n"She really frightens Kate and me out of our wits."\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre had no wish that Miss Vavasor\'s name should be\r\nbrought into play upon the occasion. "Dear Mrs. Greenow," said he,\r\n"there is no cause for you to be alarmed, I can assure you. Mere\r\ntrifles;--light as air, you know. I don\'t think anything of such\r\nthings as these."\r\n\r\n"But I and Kate think a great deal of them,--a very great deal, I can\r\nassure you. Do you know, we had a long debate this morning whether or\r\nno we would return them to Oileymead?"\r\n\r\n"Return them, Mrs. Greenow!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed: what are women, situated as we are, to do under such\r\ncircumstances? When gentlemen will be too liberal, their liberality\r\nmust be repressed."\r\n\r\n"And have I been too liberal, Mrs. Greenow? What is a young turkey and\r\na stick of celery when a man is willing to give everything that he\r\nhas in the world?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a great deal more in the world, Mr. Cheesacre, than you\'d\r\nlike to part with. But we won\'t talk of that, now."\r\n\r\n"When shall we talk of it?"\r\n\r\n"If you really have anything to say, you had by far better speak to\r\nKate herself."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow, you mistake me. Indeed, you mistake me." Just at this\r\nmoment, as he was drawing close to the widow, she heard, or fancied\r\nthat she heard, Jeannette\'s step, and, going to the sitting-room\r\ndoor, called to her maid. Jeannette did not hear her, but the bell\r\nwas rung, and then Jeannette came. "You may take these things down,\r\nJeannette," she said. "Mr. Cheesacre has promised that no more shall\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t promised," said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"You will oblige me and Kate, I know;--and, Jeannette, tell Miss\r\nVavasor that I am ready to walk with her."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Cheesacre knew that he could not say those few words on\r\nthat occasion; and as the hour of his train was near, he took his\r\ndeparture, and went out of the Close, followed by the little boy,\r\ncarrying the basket, the cloth, and the tin can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWhich Shall It Be?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and it was well known at the lodging-house\r\nin the Close that Mr. Cheesacre would not be seen there then. Mrs.\r\nGreenow had specially warned him that she was not fond of Sunday\r\nvisitors, fearing that otherwise he might find it convenient to give\r\nthem too much of his society on that idle day. In the morning the\r\naunt and niece both went to the Cathedral, and then at three o\'clock\r\nthey dined. But on this occasion they did not dine alone. Charlie\r\nFairstairs, who, with her family, had come home from Yarmouth, had\r\nbeen asked to join them; and in order that Charlie might not feel it\r\ndull, Mrs. Greenow had, with her usual good-nature, invited Captain\r\nBellfield. A very nice little dinner they had. The captain carved the\r\nturkey, giving due honour to Mr. Cheesacre as he did so; and when he\r\nnibbled his celery with his cheese, he was prettily jocose about the\r\nrichness of the farmyard at Oileymead.\r\n\r\n"He is the most generous man I ever met," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"So he is," said Captain Bellfield, "and we\'ll drink his health. Poor\r\nold Cheesy! It\'s a great pity he shouldn\'t get himself a wife."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know any man more calculated to make a young woman happy,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Miss Fairstairs. "I\'m told that his house and all\r\nabout it is quite beautiful."\r\n\r\n"Especially the straw-yard and the horse-pond," said the Captain. And\r\nthen they drank the health of their absent friend.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the ladies should go to church in the\r\nevening, and it was thought that Captain Bellfield would, perhaps,\r\naccompany them; but when the time for starting came, Kate and Charlie\r\nwere ready, but the widow was not, and she remained,--in order, as\r\nshe afterwards explained to Kate, that Captain Bellfield might not\r\nseem to be turned out of the house. He had made no offer churchwards,\r\nand,--"Poor man," as Mrs. Greenow said in her little explanation,\r\n"if I hadn\'t let him stay there, he would have had no resting-place\r\nfor the sole of his foot, but some horrid barrack-room!" Therefore\r\nthe Captain was allowed to find a resting-place in Mrs. Greenow\'s\r\ndrawing-room; but on the return of the young ladies from church, he\r\nwas not there, and the widow was alone, "looking back," she said, "to\r\nthings that were gone;--that were gone. But come, dears, I am not\r\ngoing to make you melancholy." So they had tea, and Mr. Cheesacre\'s\r\ncream was used with liberality.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bellfield had not allowed the opportunity to slip idly from\r\nhis hands. In the first quarter of an hour after the younger ladies\r\nhad gone, he said little or nothing, but sat with a wine-glass before\r\nhim, which once or twice he filled from the decanter. "I\'m afraid the\r\nwine is not very good," said Mrs. Greenow. "But one can\'t get good\r\nwine in lodgings."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not thinking very much about it, Mrs. Greenow; that\'s the truth,"\r\nsaid the Captain. "I daresay the wine is very good of its kind." Then\r\nthere was another period of silence between them.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you find it rather dull, living in lodgings; don\'t you?"\r\nasked the Captain.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know quite what you mean by dull, Captain Bellfield; but a\r\nwoman circumstanced as I am, can\'t find her life very gay. It\'s not a\r\nfull twelvemonth yet since I lost all that made life desirable, and\r\nsometimes I wonder at myself for holding up as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"It\'s wicked to give way to grief too much, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what my dear Kate always says to me, and I\'m sure I do\r\nmy best to overcome it." Upon this soft tears trickled down her\r\ncheek, showing in their course that she at any rate used no paint in\r\nproducing that freshness of colour which was one of her great charms.\r\nThen she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes, and removing it,\r\nsmiled faintly on the Captain. "I didn\'t intend to treat you to such\r\na scene as this, Captain Bellfield."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing on earth, Mrs. Greenow, I desire so much, as\r\npermission to dry those tears."\r\n\r\n"Time alone can do that, Captain Bellfield;--time alone."\r\n\r\n"But cannot time be aided by love and friendship and affection?"\r\n\r\n"By friendship, yes. What would life be worth without the solace of\r\nfriendship?"\r\n\r\n"And how much better is the warm glow of love?" Captain Bellfield,\r\nas he asked this question, deliberately got up, and moved his chair\r\nover to the widow\'s side. But the widow as deliberately changed her\r\nposition to the corner of a sofa. The Captain did not at once follow\r\nher, nor did he in any way show that he was aware that she had fled\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n"How much better is the warm glow of love?" he said again, contenting\r\nhimself with looking into her face with all his eyes. He had hoped\r\nthat he would have been able to press her hand by this time.\r\n\r\n"The warm, glow of love, Captain Bellfield, if you have ever felt\r\nit--"\r\n\r\n"If I have ever felt it! Do I not feel it now, Mrs. Greenow? There can\r\nbe no longer any mask kept upon my feelings. I never could restrain\r\nthe yearnings of my heart when they have been strong."\r\n\r\n"Have they often been strong, Captain Bellfield?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; often;--in various scenes of life; on the field of battle--"\r\n\r\n"I did not know that you had seen active service."\r\n\r\n"What!--not on the plains of Zuzuland, when with fifty picked men\r\nI kept five hundred Caffres at bay for seven weeks;--never knew the\r\ncomfort of a bed, or a pillow to my head, for seven long weeks!"\r\n\r\n"Not for seven weeks?" said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"No. Did I not see active service at Essiquebo, on the burning coast\r\nof Guiana, when all the wild Africans from the woods rose up to\r\ndestroy the colony; or again at the mouth of the Kitchyhomy River,\r\nwhen I made good the capture of a slaver by my own hand and my own\r\nsword!"\r\n\r\n"I really hadn\'t heard," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I understand. I know. Cheesy is the best fellow in the world in\r\nsome respects, but he cannot bring himself to speak well of a fellow\r\nbehind his back. I know who has belittled me. Who was the first to\r\nstorm the heights of Inkerman?" demanded the Captain, thinking in the\r\nheat of the moment that he might as well be hung for a sheep as a\r\nlamb.\r\n\r\n"But when you spoke of yearnings, I thought you meant yearnings of a\r\nsofter kind."\r\n\r\n"So I did. So I did. I don\'t know why I have been led away to speak\r\nof deeds that are very seldom mentioned, at any rate by myself. But I\r\ncannot bear that a slanderous backbiting tongue should make you think\r\nthat I have seen no service. I have served her Majesty in the four\r\nquarters of the globe, Mrs. Greenow; and now I am ready to serve you\r\nin any way in which you will allow me to make my service acceptable."\r\nWhereupon he took one stride over to the sofa, and went down upon his\r\nknees before her.\r\n\r\n"But, Captain Bellfield, I don\'t want any services. Pray get up now;\r\nthe girl will come in."\r\n\r\n"I care nothing for any girl. I am planted here till some answer\r\nshall have been made to me; till some word shall have been said\r\nthat may give me a little hope." Then he attempted to get hold\r\nof her hand, but she put them behind her back and shook her head.\r\n"Arabella," he said, "will you not speak a word to me?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word, Captain Bellfield, till you get up; and I won\'t have you\r\ncall me Arabella. I am the widow of Samuel Greenow, than whom no man\r\nwas more respected where he was known, and it is not fitting that I\r\nshould be addressed in that way."\r\n\r\n"But I want you to become my wife,--and then--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, then indeed! But that then isn\'t likely to come. Get up, Captain\r\nBellfield, or I\'ll push you over and then ring the bell. A man never\r\nlooks so much like a fool as when he\'s kneeling down,--unless he\'s\r\nsaying his prayers, as you ought to be doing now. Get up, I tell you.\r\nIt\'s just half past seven, and I told Jeannette to come to me then."\r\n\r\nThere was that in the widow\'s voice which made him get up, and he\r\nrose slowly to his feet. "You\'ve pushed all the chairs about, you\r\nstupid man," she said. Then in one minute she had restored the\r\nscattered furniture to their proper places, and had rung the bell.\r\nWhen Jeannette came she desired that tea might be ready by the time\r\nthat the young ladies returned, and asked Captain Bellfield if a cup\r\nshould be set for him. This he declined, and bade her farewell while\r\nJeannette was still in the room. She shook hands with him without\r\nany sign of anger, and even expressed a hope that they might see him\r\nagain before long.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a very handsome man, is the Captain," said Jeannette, as the\r\nhero of the Kitchyhomy River descended the stairs.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t think about handsome men, child," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure I don\'t," said Jeannette. "Not no more than anybody\r\nelse; but if a man is handsome, ma\'am, why it stands to reason that\r\nhe is handsome."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Captain Bellfield has given you a kiss and a pair of\r\ngloves."\r\n\r\n"As for gloves and such like, Mr. Cheesacre is much better for giving\r\nthan the Captain; as we all know; don\'t we, ma\'am? But in regard to\r\nkisses, they\'re presents as I never takes from anybody. Let everybody\r\npay his debts. If the Captain ever gets a wife, let him kiss her."\r\n\r\nOn the following Tuesday morning Mr. Cheesacre as usual called in the\r\nClose, but he brought with him no basket. He merely left a winter\r\nnosegay made of green leaves and laurestinus flowers, and sent up a\r\nmessage to say that he should call at half past three, and hoped that\r\nhe might then be able to see Mrs. Greenow--on particular business.\r\n\r\n"That means you, Kate," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"No, it doesn\'t; it doesn\'t mean me at all. At any rate he won\'t see\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it\'s me he wishes to see. It seems to be the fashionable\r\nplan now for gentlemen to make offers by deputy. If he says anything,\r\nI can only refer him to you, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can; you can tell him simply that I won\'t have him. But he\r\nis no more thinking of me than--"\r\n\r\n"Than he is of me, you were going to say."\r\n\r\n"No, aunt; I wasn\'t going to say that at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall see. If he does mean anything, of course you can\r\nplease yourself; but I really think you might do worse."\r\n\r\n"But if I don\'t want to do at all?"\r\n\r\n"Very well; you must have your own way. I can only tell you what I\r\nthink."\r\n\r\nAt half past three o\'clock punctually Mr. Cheesacre came to the\r\ndoor, and was shown up-stairs. He was told by Jeannette that Captain\r\nBellfield had looked in on the Sunday afternoon, but that Miss\r\nFairstairs and Miss Vavasor had been there the whole time. He had\r\nnot got on his black boots nor yet had his round topped hat. And as\r\nhe did wear a new frock coat, and had his left hand thrust into a\r\nkid glove, Jeannette was quite sure that he intended business of\r\nsome kind. With new boots, creaking loudly, he walked up into the\r\ndrawing-room, and there he found the widow alone.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the flowers," she said at once. "It was so good of you to\r\nbring something that we could accept."\r\n\r\n"As for that," said he, "I don\'t see why you should scruple about a\r\ntrifle of cream, but I hope that any such feeling as that will be\r\nover before long." To this the widow made no answer, but she looked\r\nvery sweetly on him as she bade him sit down.\r\n\r\nHe did sit down; but first he put his hat and stick carefully away in\r\none corner, and then he pulled off his glove--somewhat laboriously,\r\nfor his hand was warm. He was clearly prepared for great things. As\r\nhe pushed up his hair with his hands there came from his locks an\r\nambrosial perfume,--as of marrow-oil, and there was a fixed propriety\r\nof position of every hair of his whiskers, which indicated very\r\nplainly that he had been at a hairdresser\'s shop since he left the\r\nmarket. Nor do I believe that he had worn that coat when he came to\r\nthe door earlier in the morning. If I were to say that he had called\r\nat his tailor\'s also, I do not think that I should be wrong.\r\n\r\n"How goes everything at Oileymead?" said Mrs. Greenow, seeing that her\r\nguest wanted some little assistance in leading off the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, Mrs. Greenow; pretty well. Everything will go very well\r\nif I am successful in the object which I have on hand to-day."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope you\'ll be successful in all your undertakings."\r\n\r\n"In all my business undertakings I am, Mrs. Greenow. There isn\'t a\r\nshilling due on my land to e\'er a bank in Norwich; and I haven\'t\r\nthrashed out a quarter of last year\'s corn yet, which is more than\r\nmany of them can say. But there ain\'t many of them who don\'t have to\r\npay rent, and so perhaps I oughtn\'t to boast."\r\n\r\n"I know that Providence has been very good to you, Mr. Cheesacre, as\r\nregards worldly matters."\r\n\r\n"And I haven\'t left it all to Providence, either. Those who do,\r\ngenerally go to the wall, as far as I can see. I\'m always at work\r\nlate and early, and I know when I get a profit out of a man\'s labour\r\nand when I don\'t, as well as though it was my only chance of bread\r\nand cheese."\r\n\r\n"I always thought you understood farming business, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. I like a bit of fun well enough, when the time for it\r\ncomes, as you saw at Yarmouth. And I keep my three or four hunters,\r\nas I think a country gentleman should; and I shoot over my own\r\nground. But I always stick to my work. There are men, like Bellfield,\r\nwho won\'t work. What do they come to? They\'re always borrowing."\r\n\r\n"But he has fought his country\'s battles, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"He fight! I suppose he\'s been telling you some of his old stories.\r\nHe was ten years in the West Indies, and all his fighting was with\r\nthe mosquitoes."\r\n\r\n"But he was in the Crimea. At Inkerman, for instance--"\r\n\r\n"He in the Crimea! Well, never mind. But do you inquire before you\r\nbelieve that story. But as I was saying, Mrs. Greenow, you have seen\r\nmy little place at Oileymead."\r\n\r\n"A charming house. All you want is a mistress for it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it; that\'s just it. All I want is a mistress for it. And\r\nthere\'s only one woman on earth that I would wish to see in that\r\nposition. Arabella Greenow, will you be that woman?" As he made the\r\noffer he got up and stood before her, placing his right hand upon his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Arabella Greenow, will you be that woman?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I, Mr. Cheesacre!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you. Who else? Since I saw you what other woman has been\r\nanything to me; or, indeed, I may say before? Since the first day\r\nI saw you I felt that there my happiness depended."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, I thought you were looking elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no. There never was such a mistake as that. I have the\r\nhighest regard and esteem for Miss Vavasor, but really--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre, what am I to say to you?"\r\n\r\n"What are you to say to me? Say that you\'ll be mine. Say that I shall\r\nbe yours. Say that all I have at Oileymead shall be yours. Say that\r\nthe open carriage for a pair of ponies to be driven by a lady which\r\nI have been looking at this morning shall be yours. Yes, indeed; the\r\nsweetest thing you ever saw in your life,--just like one that the\r\nlady of the Lord Lieutenant drives about in always. That\'s what you\r\nmust say. Come, Mrs. Greenow!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Cheesacre, you don\'t know what it is to have buried the pride\r\nof your youth hardly yet twelve months."\r\n\r\n"But you have buried him, and there let there be an end of it. Your\r\nsitting here all alone, morning, noon, and night, won\'t bring him\r\nback. I\'m sorry for him; I am indeed. Poor Greenow! But what more can\r\nI do?"\r\n\r\n"I can do more, Mr. Cheesacre. I can mourn for him in solitude and in\r\nsilence."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no. What\'s the use of it,--breaking your heart for\r\nnothing,--and my heart too. You never think of that." And Mr.\r\nCheesacre spoke in a tone that was full of reproach.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but it can be. Come, Mrs. Greenow. We understand each other well\r\nenough now, surely. Come, dearest." And he approached her as though\r\nto put his arm round her waist. But at that moment there came a knock\r\nat the door, and Jeannette, entering the room, told her mistress that\r\nCaptain Bellfield was below and wanted to know whether he could see\r\nher for a minute on particular business.\r\n\r\n"Show Captain Bellfield up, certainly," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"D---- Captain Bellfield!" said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nAlice Is Taught to Grow Upwards, Towards the Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the day came on which Alice was to go to Matching Priory, she\r\nhad often regretted that she had been induced to make the promise,\r\nand yet she had as often resolved that there was no possible reason\r\nwhy she should not go to Matching Priory. But she feared this\r\ncommencement of a closer connection with her great relations. She\r\nhad told herself so often that she was quite separated from them,\r\nthat the slight accident of blood in no way tied her to them or them\r\nto her,--this lesson had been so thoroughly taught to her by the\r\ninjudicious attempts of Lady Macleod to teach an opposite lesson,\r\nthat she did not like the idea of putting aside the effect of that\r\nteaching. And perhaps she was a little afraid of the great folk whom\r\nshe might probably meet at her cousin\'s house. Lady Glencora herself\r\nshe had liked,--and had loved too with that momentary love which\r\ncertain circumstances of our life will sometimes produce, a love\r\nwhich is strong while it lasts, but which can be laid down when the\r\nneed of it is passed. She had liked and loved Lady Glencora, and had\r\nin no degree been afraid of her during those strange visitings in\r\nQueen Anne Street;--but she was by no means sure that she should like\r\nLady Glencora in the midst of her grandeur and surrounded by the pomp\r\nof her rank. She would have no other friend or acquaintance in that\r\nhouse, and feared that she might find herself desolate, cold, and\r\nwounded in her pride. She had been tricked into the visit, too, or\r\nrather had tricked herself into it. She had been sure that there had\r\nbeen a joint scheme between her cousin and Lady Midlothian, and could\r\nnot resist the temptation of repudiating it in her letter to Lady\r\nGlencora. But there had been no such scheme; she had wronged Lady\r\nGlencora, and had therefore been unable to resist her second request.\r\nBut she felt unhappy, fearing that she would be out of her element,\r\nand more than once half made up her mind to excuse herself.\r\n\r\nHer aunt had, from the first, thought well of her going, believing\r\nthat it might probably be the means of reconciling her to Mr. Grey.\r\nMoreover, it was a step altogether in the right direction. Lady\r\nGlencora would, if she lived, become a Duchess, and as she was\r\ndecidedly Alice\'s cousin, of course Alice should go to her house when\r\ninvited. It must be acknowledged that Lady Macleod was not selfish\r\nin her worship of rank. She had played out her game in life, and\r\nthere was no probability that she would live to be called cousin by\r\na Duchess of Omnium. She bade Alice go to Matching Priory, simply\r\nbecause she loved her niece, and therefore wished her to live in the\r\nbest and most eligible way within her reach. "I think you owe it as a\r\nduty to your family to go," said Lady Macleod.\r\n\r\nWhat further correspondence about her affairs had passed between Lady\r\nMacleod and Lady Midlothian Alice never knew. She steadily refused\r\nall entreaty made that she would answer the Countess\'s letter, and\r\nat last threatened her aunt that if the request were further urged\r\nshe would answer it,--telling Lady Midlothian that she had been very\r\nimpertinent.\r\n\r\n"I am becoming a very old woman, Alice," the poor lady said,\r\npiteously, "and I suppose I had better not interfere any further.\r\nWhatever I have said I have always meant to be for your good." Then\r\nAlice got up, and kissing her aunt, tried to explain to her that she\r\nresented no interference from her, and felt grateful for all that she\r\nboth said and did; but that she could not endure meddling from people\r\nwhom she did not know, and who thought themselves entitled to meddle\r\nby their rank.\r\n\r\n"And because they are cousins as well," said Lady Macleod, in a\r\nsoftly sad, apologetic voice.\r\n\r\nAlice left Cheltenham about the middle of November on her road to\r\nMatching Priory. She was to sleep in London one night, and go down to\r\nMatching in Yorkshire with her maid on the following day. Her father\r\nundertook to meet her at the Great Western Station, and to take her\r\non the following morning to the Great Northern. He said nothing in\r\nhis letter about dining with her, but when he met her, muttered\r\nsomething about an engagement, and taking her home graciously\r\npromised that he would breakfast with her on the following morning.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad you are going, Alice," he said when they were in the\r\ncab together.\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Why?--because I think it\'s the proper thing to do. You know I\'ve\r\nnever said much to you about these people. They\'re not connected with\r\nme, and I know that they hate the name of Vavasor;--not but what the\r\nname is a deal older than any of theirs, and the family too."\r\n\r\n"And therefore I don\'t understand why you think I\'m specially right.\r\nIf you were to say I was specially wrong, I should be less surprised,\r\nand of course I shouldn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"You should go by all means. Rank and wealth are advantages, let\r\nanybody say what they will to the contrary. Why else does everybody\r\nwant to get them?"\r\n\r\n"But I shan\'t get them by going to Matching Priory."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get part of their value. Take them as a whole, the nobility\r\nof England are pleasant acquaintances to have. I haven\'t run after\r\nthem very much myself, though I married, as I may say, among them.\r\nThat very thing rather stood in my way than otherwise. But you may be\r\nsure of this, that men and women ought to grow, like plants, upwards.\r\nEverybody should endeavour to stand as well as he can in the world,\r\nand if I had a choice of acquaintance between a sugar-baker and a\r\npeer, I should prefer the peer,--unless, indeed, the sugar-baker\r\nhad something very strong on his side to offer. I don\'t call that\r\ntuft-hunting, and it does not necessitate toadying. It\'s simply\r\ngrowing up, towards the light, as the trees do."\r\n\r\nAlice listened to her father\'s worldly wisdom with a smile, but she\r\ndid not attempt to answer him. It was very seldom, indeed, that he\r\ntook upon himself the labour of lecturing her, or that he gave her\r\neven as much counsel as he had given now. "Well, papa, I hope I shall\r\nfind myself growing towards the light," she said as she got out of\r\nthe cab. Then he had not entered the house, but had taken the cab on\r\nwith him to his club.\r\n\r\nOn her table Alice found a note from her cousin George. "I hear you\r\nare going down to the Pallisers at Matching Priory to-morrow, and as\r\nI shall be glad to say one word to you before you go, will you let\r\nme see you this evening,--say at nine?--G. V." She felt immediately\r\nthat she could not help seeing him, but she greatly regretted the\r\nnecessity. She wished that she had gone directly from Cheltenham to\r\nthe North,--regardless even of those changes of wardrobe which her\r\npurposed visit required. Then she set herself to considering. How had\r\nGeorge heard of her visit to the Priory, and how had he learned the\r\nprecise evening which she would pass in London? Why should he be so\r\nintent on watching all her movements as it seemed that he was? As to\r\nseeing him she had no alternative, so she completed her arrangements\r\nfor her journey before nine, and then awaited him in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad you\'re going to Matching Priory," were the first words\r\nhe said. He, too, might have taught her to grow towards the light,\r\nif she had asked him for his reasons;--but this she did not do just\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n"How did you learn that I was going?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I heard it from a friend of mine. Well;--from Burgo Fitzgerald, if\r\nyou must know."\r\n\r\n"From Mr. Fitzgerald?" said Alice, in profound astonishment: "How\r\ncould Mr. Fitzgerald have heard of it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than I know, Alice. Not directly from Lady Glencora, I\r\nshould say."\r\n\r\n"That would be impossible."\r\n\r\n"Yes; quite so, no doubt. I think she keeps up her intimacy with\r\nBurgo\'s sister, and perhaps it got round to him in that way."\r\n\r\n"And did he tell you also that I was going to-morrow? He must have\r\nknown all about it very accurately."\r\n\r\n"No; then I asked Kate, and Kate told me when you were going. Yes; I\r\nknow. Kate has been wrong, hasn\'t she? Kate was cautioned, no doubt,\r\nto say nothing about your comings and goings to so inconsiderable\r\na person as myself. But you must not be down upon Kate. She never\r\nmentioned it till I showed by my question to her that I knew all\r\nabout your journey to Matching. I own I do not understand why it\r\nshould be necessary to keep me so much in the dark."\r\n\r\nAlice felt that she was blushing. The caution had been given to Kate\r\nbecause Kate still transgressed in her letters, by saying little\r\nwords about her brother. And Alice did not even now believe Kate\r\nto have been false to her; but she saw that she herself had been\r\nimprudent.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand it," continued George, speaking without looking\r\nat her. "It was but the other day that we were such dear friends! Do\r\nyou remember the balcony at Basle? and now it seems that we are quite\r\nestranged;--nay, worse than estranged; that I am, as it were, under\r\nsome ban. Have I done anything to offend you, Alice? If so, speak\r\nout, like a woman of spirit as you are."\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Then why am I tabooed? Why was I told the other day that I might not\r\ncongratulate you on your happy emancipation? I say boldly, that had\r\nyou resolved on that while we were together in Switzerland, you would\r\nhave permitted me, as a friend, almost as a brother, to discuss it\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"I think not, George."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would. And why has Kate been warned not to tell me of\r\nthis visit to the Pallisers? I know she has been warned though she\r\nhas not confessed it."\r\n\r\nAlice sat silent, not knowing what to say in answer to this charge\r\nbrought against her,--thinking, perhaps, that the questioner would\r\nallow his question to pass without an answer. But Vavasor was not so\r\ncomplaisant. "If there be any reason, Alice, I think that I have a\r\nright to ask it."\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds she did not speak a word, but sat considering.\r\nHe also remained silent with his eyes fixed upon her. She looked\r\nat him and saw nothing but his scar,--nothing but his scar and the\r\nbrightness of his eyes, which was almost fierce. She knew that he was\r\nin earnest, and therefore resolved that she would be in earnest also.\r\n"I think that you have such a right," she said at last.\r\n\r\n"Then let me exercise it."\r\n\r\n"I think that you have such a right, but I think also that you are\r\nungenerous to exercise it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand that. By heavens, Alice, I cannot be left in\r\nthis suspense! If I have done anything to offend you, perhaps I can\r\nremove the offence by apology."\r\n\r\n"You have done nothing to offend me."\r\n\r\n"Or if there be any cause why our friendship should be dropped,--why\r\nwe should be on a different footing to each other in London than we\r\nwere in Switzerland, I may acknowledge it, if it be explained to me.\r\nBut I cannot put up with the doubt, when I am told that I have a\r\nright to demand its solution."\r\n\r\n"Then I will be frank with you, George, though my being so will, as\r\nyou may guess, be very painful." She paused again, looking at him\r\nto see if yet he would spare her; but he was all scar and eyes as\r\nbefore, and there was no mercy in his face.\r\n\r\n"Your sister, George, has thought that my parting with Mr. Grey\r\nmight lead to a renewal of a purpose of marriage between you and me.\r\nYou know her eagerness, and will understand that it may have been\r\nnecessary that I should require silence from her on that head. You\r\nought now to understand it all."\r\n\r\n"I then am being punished for her sins," he said; and suddenly the\r\nscar on his face was healed up again, and there was something of the\r\nold pleasantness in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I have said nothing about any sins, George, but I have found it\r\nnecessary to be on my guard."\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, after a short pause, "You are an honest woman,\r\nAlice,--the honestest I ever knew. I will bring Kate to order,--and,\r\nnow, we may be friends again; may we not?" And he extended his hand\r\nto her across the table.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "certainly, if you wish it." She spoke doubtingly,\r\nwith indecision in her voice, as though remembering at the moment\r\nthat he had given her no pledge. "I certainly do wish it very much,"\r\nsaid he; and then she gave him her hand.\r\n\r\n"And I may now talk about your new freedom?"\r\n\r\n"No," said she; "no. Do not speak of that. A woman does not do what I\r\nhave done in that affair without great suffering. I have to think of\r\nit daily; but do not make me speak of it."\r\n\r\n"But this other subject, this visit to Matching; surely I may speak\r\nof that?" There was something now in his voice so bright, that she\r\nfelt the influence of it, and answered him cheerfully, "I don\'t see\r\nwhat you can have to say about it."\r\n\r\n"But I have a great deal. I am so glad you are going. Mind you cement\r\na close intimacy with Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\n"With Mr. Palliser?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; with Mr. Palliser. You must read all the blue books about\r\nfinance. I\'ll send them to you if you like it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite in earnest. That is, not in earnest about the blue books,\r\nas you would not have time; but about Mr. Palliser. He will be the new\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer without a doubt."\r\n\r\n"Will he indeed? But why should I make a bosom friend of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. I don\'t want any public money."\r\n\r\n"But I do, my girl. Don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"I think I shall get returned at this next election."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope you will."\r\n\r\n"And if I do, of course it will be my game to support the\r\nministry;--or rather the new ministry; for of course there will be\r\nchanges."\r\n\r\n"I hope they will be on the right side."\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt of that, Alice."\r\n\r\n"I wish they might be changed altogether."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s impossible. It\'s very well as a dream; but there are no\r\nsuch men as you want to see,--men really from the people,--strong\r\nenough to take high office. A man can\'t drive four horses because\r\nhe\'s a philanthropist,--or rather a philhorseophist, and is desirous\r\nthat the team should be driven without any hurt to them. A man can\'t\r\ngovern well, simply because he is genuinely anxious that men should\r\nbe well governed."\r\n\r\n"And will there never be any such men?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say that. I don\'t mind confessing to you that it is my\r\nambition to be such a one myself. But a child must crawl before he\r\ncan walk. Such a one as I, hoping to do something in politics, must\r\nspare no chance. It would be something to me that Mr. Palliser should\r\nbecome the friend of any dear friend of mine,--especially of a dear\r\nfriend bearing the same name."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, George, you\'ll find me a bad hand at making any such\r\nfriendship."\r\n\r\n"They say he is led immensely by his wife, and that she is very\r\nclever. But I mean this chiefly, Alice, that I do hope I shall have\r\nall your sympathy in any political career that I may make, and all\r\nyour assistance also."\r\n\r\n"My sympathy I think I can promise you. My assistance, I fear, would\r\nbe worthless."\r\n\r\n"By no means worthless, Alice; not if I see you take that place in\r\nthe world which I hope to see you fill. Do you think women nowadays\r\nhave no bearing upon the politics of the times? Almost as much as men\r\nhave." In answer to which Alice shook her head; but, nevertheless,\r\nshe felt in some way pleased and flattered.\r\n\r\nGeorge left her without saying a word more about her marriage\r\nprospects past or future, and Alice as she went to bed felt glad that\r\nthis explanation between them had been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDandy and Flirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice reached the Matching Road Station about three o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon without adventure, and immediately on the stopping of the\r\ntrain became aware that all trouble was off her own hands. A servant\r\nin livery came to the open window, and touching his hat to her,\r\ninquired if she were Miss Vavasor. Then her dressing-bag and shawls\r\nand cloaks were taken from her, and she was conveyed through the\r\nstation by the station-master on one side of her, the footman on the\r\nother, and by the railway porter behind. She instantly perceived that\r\nshe had become possessed of great privileges by belonging even for a\r\ntime to Matching Priory, and that she was essentially growing upwards\r\ntowards the light.\r\n\r\nOutside, on the broad drive before the little station, she saw an\r\nomnibus that was going to the small town of Matching, intended for\r\npeople who had not grown upwards as had been her lot; and she saw\r\nalso a light stylish-looking cart which she would have called a\r\nWhitechapel had she been properly instructed in such matters, and\r\na little low open carriage with two beautiful small horses, in\r\nwhich was sitting a lady enveloped in furs. Of course this was Lady\r\nGlencora. Another servant was standing on the ground, holding the\r\nhorses of the carriage and the cart.\r\n\r\n"Dear Alice, I\'m so glad you\'ve come," said a voice from the\r\nfurs. "Look here, dear; your maid can go in the dog-cart with\r\nyour things,"--it wasn\'t a dog-cart, but Lady Glencora knew no\r\nbetter;--"she\'ll be quite comfortable there; and do you get in here.\r\nAre you very cold?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; not cold at all."\r\n\r\n"But it is awfully cold. You\'ve been in the stuffy carriage, but\r\nyou\'ll find it cold enough out here, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Lady Glencora, I am so sorry that I\'ve brought you out on such\r\na morning," said Alice, getting in and taking the place assigned her\r\nnext to the charioteer.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! Sorry! Why I\'ve looked forward to meeting you all\r\nalone, ever since I knew you were coming. If it had snowed all the\r\nmorning I should have come just the same. I drive out almost every\r\nday when I\'m down here,--that is, when the house is not too crowded,\r\nor I can make an excuse. Wrap these things over you; there are plenty\r\nof them. You shall drive if you like." Alice, however, declined the\r\ndriving, expressing her gratitude in what prettiest words she could\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n"I like driving better than anything, I think. Mr. Palliser doesn\'t\r\nlike ladies to hunt, and of course it wouldn\'t do as he does not hunt\r\nhimself. I do ride, but he never gets on horseback. I almost fancy I\r\nshould like to drive four-in-hand,--only I know I should be afraid."\r\n\r\n"It would look very terrible," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Yes; wouldn\'t it? The look would be the worst of it; as it is all\r\nthe world over. Sometimes I wish there were no such things as looks.\r\nI don\'t mean anything improper, you know; only one does get so\r\nhampered, right and left, for fear of Mrs. Grundy. I endeavour to go\r\nstraight, and get along pretty well on the whole, I suppose. Baker,\r\nyou must put Dandy in the bar; he pulls so, going home, that I can\'t\r\nhold him in the check." She stopped the horses, and Baker, a very\r\ncompletely-got-up groom of some forty years of age, who sat behind,\r\ngot down and put the impetuous Dandy "in the bar," thereby changing\r\nthe rein, so that the curb was brought to bear on him. "They\'re\r\ncalled Dandy and Flirt," continued Lady Glencora, speaking to Alice.\r\n"Ain\'t they a beautiful match? The Duke gave them to me and named\r\nthem himself. Did you ever see the Duke?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Baker, you must put Dandy in the bar."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Never," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t be here before Christmas, but you shall be introduced some\r\nday in London. He\'s an excellent creature and I\'m a great pet of his;\r\nthough, after all, I never speak half a dozen words to him when I see\r\nhim. He\'s one of those people who never talk. I\'m one of those who\r\nlike talking, as you\'ll find out. I think it runs in families; and\r\nthe Pallisers are non-talkers. That doesn\'t mean that they are not\r\nspeakers, for Mr. Palliser has plenty to say in the House, and they\r\ndeclare that he\'s one of the few public men who\'ve got lungs enough\r\nto make a financial statement without breaking down."\r\n\r\nAlice was aware that she had as yet hardly spoken herself, and\r\nbegan to bethink herself that she didn\'t know what to say. Had Lady\r\nGlencora paused on the subject of Dandy and Flirt, she might have\r\nmanaged to be enthusiastic about the horses, but she could not\r\ndiscuss freely the general silence of the Palliser family, nor the\r\nexcellent lungs, as regarded public purposes, of the one who was\r\nthe husband of her present friend. So she asked how far it was to\r\nMatching Priory.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not tired of me already, I hope," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that," said Alice. "I delight in the drive. But\r\nsomehow one expects Matching Station to be near Matching."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; that\'s a great cheat. It\'s not Matching Station at all\r\nbut Matching Road Station, and it\'s eight miles. It is a great bore,\r\nfor though the omnibus brings our parcels, we have to be constantly\r\nsending over, and it\'s very expensive, I can assure you. I want Mr.\r\nPalliser to have a branch, but he says he would have to take all the\r\nshares himself, and that would cost more, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Is there a town at Matching?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a little bit of a place. I\'ll go round by it if you like, and in\r\nat the further gate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I should like. It was a borough once, and belonged to the\r\nDuke; but they put it out at the Reform Bill. They made some kind of\r\nbargain;--he was to keep either Silverbridge or Matching, but not\r\nboth. Mr. Palliser sits for Silverbridge, you know. The Duke chose\r\nSilverbridge,--or rather his father did, as he was then going to\r\nbuild his great place in Barsetshire;--that\'s near Silverbridge. But\r\nthe Matching people haven\'t forgiven him yet. He was sitting for\r\nMatching himself when the Reform Bill passed. Then his father died,\r\nand he hasn\'t lived there much since. It\'s a great deal nicer place\r\nthan Gatherum Castle, only not half so grand. I hate grandeur; don\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I never tried much of it, as you have."\r\n\r\n"Come now; that\'s not fair. There\'s no one in the world less grand\r\nthan I am."\r\n\r\n"I mean that I\'ve not had grand people about me."\r\n\r\n"Having cut all your cousins,--and Lady Midlothian in particular,\r\nlike a naughty girl as you are. I was so angry with you when you\r\naccused me of selling you about that. You ought to have known that\r\nI was the last person in the world to have done such a thing."\r\n\r\n"I did not think you meant to sell me, but I thought--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did, Alice. I know what you thought; you thought that Lady\r\nMidlothian was making a tool of me that I might bring you under her\r\nthumb, so that she might bully you into Mr. Grey\'s arms. That\'s what\r\nyou thought. I don\'t know that I was at all entitled to your good\r\nopinion, but I was not entitled to that special bad opinion."\r\n\r\n"I had no bad opinion;--but it was so necessary that I should guard\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You shall be guarded. I\'ll take you under my shield. Mr. Grey shan\'t\r\nbe named to you, except that I shall expect you to tell me all about\r\nit; and you must tell me all about that dangerous cousin, too, of\r\nwhom they were saying such terrible things down in Scotland. I had\r\nheard of him before." These last words Lady Glencora spoke in a lower\r\nvoice and in an altered tone,--slowly, as though she were thinking of\r\nsomething that pained her. It was from Burgo Fitzgerald that she had\r\nheard of George Vavasor.\r\n\r\nAlice did not know what to say. She found it impossible to discuss\r\nall the most secret and deepest of her feelings out in that open\r\ncarriage, perhaps in the hearing of the servant behind, on this her\r\nfirst meeting with her cousin,--of whom, in fact, she knew very\r\nlittle. She had not intended to discuss these things at all, and\r\ncertainly not in such a manner as this. So she remained silent. "This\r\nis the beginning of the park," said Lady Glencora, pointing to a\r\ngrand old ruin of an oak tree, which stood on the wide margin of the\r\nroad, outside the rounded corner of the park palings, propped up with\r\na skeleton of supporting sticks all round it. "And that is Matching\r\noak, under which Coeur de Lion or Edward the Third, I forget which,\r\nwas met by Sir Guy de Palisere as he came from the war, or from\r\nhunting, or something of that kind. It was the king, you know, who\r\nhad been fighting or whatever it was, and Sir Guy entertained him\r\nwhen he was very tired. Jeffrey Palliser, who is my husband\'s cousin,\r\nsays that old Sir Guy luckily pulled out his brandy-flask. But the\r\nking immediately gave him all the lands of Matching,--only there was\r\na priory then and a lot of monks, and I don\'t quite understand how\r\nthat was. But I know one of the younger brothers always used to be\r\nabbot and sit in the House of Lords. And the king gave him Littlebury\r\nat the same time, which is about seven miles away from here. As\r\nJeffrey Palliser says, it was a great deal of money for a pull at his\r\nflask. Jeffrey Palliser is here now, and I hope you\'ll like him. If\r\nI have no child, and Mr. Palliser were not to marry again, Jeffrey\r\nwould be the heir." And here again her voice was low and slow, and\r\naltogether changed in its tone.\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s the way most of the old families got their\r\nestates."\r\n\r\n"Either so, or by robbery. Many of them were terrible thieves, my\r\ndear, and I dare say Sir Guy was no better than he should be. But\r\nsince that they have always called some of the Pallisers Plantagenet.\r\nMy husband\'s name is Plantagenet. The Duke is called George\r\nPlantagenet, and the king was his godfather. The queen is my\r\ngodmother, I believe, but I don\'t know that I\'m much the better for\r\nit. There\'s no use in godfathers and godmothers;--do you think there\r\nis?"\r\n\r\n"Not much as it\'s managed now."\r\n\r\n"If I had a child,-- Oh, Alice, it\'s a dreadful thing not to have a\r\nchild when so much depends on it!"\r\n\r\n"But you\'re such a short time married yet."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well; I can see it in his eyes when he asks me questions; but I\r\ndon\'t think he\'d say an unkind word, not if his own position depended\r\non it. Ah, well; this is Matching. That other gate we passed, where\r\nDandy wanted to turn in,--that\'s where we usually go up, but I\'ve\r\nbrought you round to show you the town. That\'s the inn,--whoever can\r\npossibly come to stay there I don\'t know; I never saw anybody go in\r\nor out. That\'s the baker who bakes our bread,--we baked it at the\r\nhouse at first, but nobody could eat it; and I know that that man\r\nthere mends Mr. Palliser\'s shoes. He\'s very particular about his\r\nshoes. We shall see the church as we go in at the other gate. It\r\nis in the park, and is very pretty,--but not half so pretty as the\r\npriory ruins close to the house. The ruins are our great lion. I do\r\nso love to wander about them at moonlight. I often think of you when\r\nI do; I don\'t know why.--But I do know why, and I\'ll tell you some\r\nday. Come, Miss Flirt!"\r\n\r\nAs they drove up through the park, Lady Glencora pointed out first\r\nthe church and then the ruins, through the midst of which the road\r\nran, and then they were at once before the front door. The corner\r\nof the modern house came within two hundred yards of the gateway of\r\nthe old priory. It was a large building, very pretty, with two long\r\nfronts; but it was no more than a house. It was not a palace, nor a\r\ncastle, nor was it hardly to be called a mansion. It was built with\r\ngabled roofs, four of which formed the side from which the windows of\r\nthe drawing-rooms opened out upon a lawn which separated the house\r\nfrom the old ruins, and which indeed surrounded the ruins, and went\r\ninside them, forming the present flooring of the old chapel, and\r\nthe old refectory, and the old cloisters. Much of the cloisters\r\nindeed was standing, and there the stone pavement remained; but the\r\nsquare of the cloisters was all turfed, and in the middle of it stood\r\na large modern stone vase, out of the broad basin of which hung\r\nflowering creepers and green tendrils.\r\n\r\nAs Lady Glencora drove up to the door, a gentleman, who had heard the\r\nsound of the wheels, came forth to meet them. "There\'s Mr. Palliser,"\r\nsaid she; "that shows that you are an honoured guest, for you may\r\nbe sure that he is hard at work and would not have come out for\r\nanybody else. Plantagenet, here is Miss Vavasor, perished. Alice, my\r\nhusband." Then Mr. Palliser put forth his hand and helped her out of\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve not found it very cold," said he. "The winter has come\r\nupon us quite suddenly."\r\n\r\nHe said nothing more to her than this, till he met her again before\r\ndinner. He was a tall thin man, apparently not more than thirty years\r\nof age, looking in all respects like a gentleman, but with nothing in\r\nhis appearance that was remarkable. It was a face that you might see\r\nand forget, and see again and forget again; and yet when you looked\r\nat it and pulled it to pieces, you found that it was a fairly good\r\nface, showing intellect in the forehead, and much character in the\r\nmouth. The eyes too, though not to be called bright, had always\r\nsomething to say for themselves, looking as though they had a real\r\nmeaning. But the outline of the face was almost insignificant, being\r\ntoo thin; and he wore no beard to give it character. But, indeed, Mr.\r\nPalliser was a man who had never thought of assisting his position in\r\nthe world by his outward appearance. Not to be looked at, but to be\r\nread about in the newspapers, was his ambition. Men said that he was\r\nto be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and no one thought of suggesting\r\nthat the insignificance of his face would stand in his way.\r\n\r\n"Are the people all out?" his wife asked him.\r\n\r\n"The men have not come in from shooting;--at least I think not;--and\r\nsome of the ladies are driving, I suppose. But I haven\'t seen anybody\r\nsince you went."\r\n\r\n"Of course you haven\'t. He never has time, Alice, to see any one.\r\nBut we\'ll go up-stairs, dear. I told them to let us have tea in my\r\ndressing-room, as I thought you\'d like that better than going into\r\nthe drawing-room before you had taken off your things. You must be\r\nfamished, I know. Then you can come down, or if you want to avoid\r\ntwo dressings you can sit over the fire up-stairs till dinner-time."\r\nSo saying she skipped up-stairs and Alice followed her. "Here\'s my\r\ndressing-room, and here\'s your room all but opposite. You look out\r\ninto the park. It\'s pretty, isn\'t it? But come into my dressing-room,\r\nand see the ruins out of the window."\r\n\r\nAlice followed Lady Glencora across the passage into what she\r\ncalled her dressing-room, and there found herself surrounded by\r\nan infinitude of feminine luxuries. The prettiest of tables were\r\nthere;--the easiest of chairs;--the most costly of cabinets;--the\r\nquaintest of old china ornaments. It was bright with the gayest\r\ncolours,--made pleasant to the eye with the binding of many books,\r\nhaving nymphs painted on the ceiling and little Cupids on the doors.\r\n"Isn\'t it pretty?" she said, turning quickly on Alice. "I call it\r\nmy dressing-room because in that way I can keep people out of it,\r\nbut I have my brushes and soap in a little closet there, and my\r\nclothes,--my clothes are everywhere I suppose, only there are none\r\nof them here. Isn\'t it pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Very pretty."\r\n\r\n"The Duke did it all. He understands such things thoroughly. Now\r\nto Mr. Palliser a dressing-room is a dressing-room, and a bedroom a\r\nbedroom. He cares for nothing being pretty; not even his wife, or he\r\nwouldn\'t have married me."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t say that if you meant it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. Sometimes when I look at myself, when I simply\r\nam myself, with no making up or grimacing, you know, I think I\'m the\r\nugliest young woman the sun ever shone on. And in ten years\' time\r\nI shall be the ugliest old woman. Only think,--my hair is beginning\r\nto get grey, and I\'m not twenty-one yet. Look at it;" and she lifted\r\nup the wavy locks just above her ear. "But there\'s one comfort; he\r\ndoesn\'t care about beauty. How old are you?"\r\n\r\n"Over five-and-twenty," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense;--then I oughtn\'t to have asked you. I am so sorry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense at any rate. Why should you think I should be\r\nashamed of my age?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why, only somehow, people are; and I didn\'t think you\r\nwere so old. Five-and-twenty seems so old to me. It would be nothing\r\nif you were married; only, you see, you won\'t get married."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may yet; some day."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will. You\'ll have to give way. You\'ll find that\r\nthey\'ll get the better of you. Your father will storm at you, and\r\nLady Macleod will preach at you, and Lady Midlothian will jump upon\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bit afraid of Lady Midlothian."\r\n\r\n"I know what it is, my dear, to be jumped upon. We talked with such\r\nhorror of the French people giving their daughters in marriage, just\r\nas they might sell a house or a field, but we do exactly the same\r\nthing ourselves. When they all come upon you in earnest how are you\r\nto stand against them? How can any girl do it?"\r\n\r\n"I think I shall be able."\r\n\r\n"To be sure you\'re older,--and you are not so heavily weighted. But\r\nnever mind; I didn\'t mean to talk about that;--not yet at any rate.\r\nWell, now, my dear, I must go down. The Duchess of St. Bungay is here,\r\nand Mr. Palliser will be angry if I don\'t do pretty to her. The Duke\r\nis to be the new President of the Council, or rather, I believe he\r\nis President now. I try to remember it all, but it is so hard when\r\none doesn\'t really care two pence how it goes. Not but what I\'m very\r\nanxious that Mr. Palliser should be Chancellor of the Exchequer. And\r\nnow, will you remain here, or will you come down with me, or will you\r\ngo to your own room, and I\'ll call for you when I go down to dinner?\r\nWe dine at eight."\r\n\r\nAlice decided that she would stay in her own room till dinner time,\r\nand was taken there by Lady Glencora. She found her maid unpacking\r\nher clothes, and for a while employed herself in assisting at the\r\nwork; but that was soon done, and then she was left alone. "I shall\r\nfeel so strange, ma\'am, among all those people down-stairs," said the\r\ngirl. "They all seem to look at me as though they didn\'t know who I\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get over that soon, Jane."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall; but you see, they\'re all like knowing each other,\r\nmiss."\r\n\r\nAlice, when she sat down alone, felt herself to be very much in the\r\nsame condition as her maid. What would the Duchess of St. Bungay or Mr.\r\nJeffrey Palliser,--who himself might live to be a duke if things went\r\nwell for him,--care for her? As to Mr. Palliser, the master of the\r\nhouse, it was already evident to her that he would not put himself\r\nout of his way for her. Had she not done wrong to come there? If it\r\nwere possible for her to fly away, back to the dullness of Queen Anne\r\nStreet, or even to the preachings of Lady Macleod, would she not do\r\nso immediately? What business had she,--she asked herself,--to come\r\nto such a house as that? Lady Glencora was very kind to her, but\r\nfrightened her even by her kindness. Moreover, she was aware that\r\nLady Glencora could not devote herself especially to any such guest\r\nas she was. Lady Glencora must of course look after her duchesses,\r\nand do pretty, as she called it, to her husband\'s important political\r\nalliances.\r\n\r\nAnd then she began to think about Lady Glencora herself. What a\r\nstrange, weird nature she was,--with her round blue eyes and wavy\r\nhair, looking sometimes like a child and sometimes almost like an old\r\nwoman! And how she talked! What things she said, and what terrible\r\nforebodings she uttered of stranger things that she meant to say! Why\r\nhad she at their first meeting made that allusion to the mode of her\r\nown betrothal,--and then, checking herself for speaking of it so\r\nsoon, almost declare that she meant to speak more of it hereafter?\r\n"She should never mention it to any one," said Alice to herself.\r\n"If her lot in life has not satisfied her, there is so much the\r\nmore reason why she should not mention it." Then Alice protested to\r\nherself that no father, no aunt, no Lady Midlothian should persuade\r\nher into a marriage of which she feared the consequences. But Lady\r\nGlencora had made for herself excuses which were not altogether\r\nuntrue. She had been very young, and had been terribly weighted with\r\nher wealth.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to Alice that her cousin had told her everything in\r\nthat hour and a half that they had been together. She had given\r\na whole history of her husband and of herself. She had said how\r\nindifferent he was to her pleasures, and how vainly she strove to\r\ninterest herself in his pursuits. And then, as yet, she was childless\r\nand without prospect of a child, when, as she herself had said,--"so\r\nmuch depended on it." It was very strange to Alice that all this\r\nshould have been already told to her. And why should Lady Glencora\r\nthink of Alice when she walked out among the priory ruins by\r\nmoonlight?\r\n\r\nThe two hours seemed to her very long,--as though she were passing\r\nher time in absolute seclusion at Matching. Of course she did not\r\ndare to go down-stairs. But at last her maid came to dress her.\r\n\r\n"How do you get on below, Jane?" her mistress asked her.\r\n\r\n"Why, miss, they are uncommon civil, and I don\'t think after all it\r\nwill be so bad. We had our teas very comfortable in the housekeeper\'s\r\nroom. There are five or six of us altogether, all ladies\'-maids,\r\nmiss; and there\'s nothing on earth to do all the day long, only sit\r\nand do a little needlework over the fire."\r\n\r\nA few minutes before eight Lady Glencora knocked at Alice\'s door, and\r\ntook her arm to lead her to the drawing-room. Alice saw that she was\r\nmagnificently dressed, with an enormous expanse of robe, and that her\r\nlocks had been so managed that no one could suspect the presence of\r\na grey hair. Indeed, with all her magnificence, she looked almost a\r\nchild. "Let me see," she said, as they went down-stairs together.\r\n"I\'ll tell Jeffrey to take you in to dinner. He\'s about the easiest\r\nyoung man we have here. He rather turns up his nose at everything,\r\nbut that doesn\'t make him the less agreeable; does it, dear?--unless\r\nhe turns up his nose at you, you know."\r\n\r\n"But perhaps he will."\r\n\r\n"No; he won\'t do that. That would be uncourteous,--and he\'s the most\r\ncourteous man in the world. There\'s nobody here, you see," she said\r\nas they entered the room, "and I didn\'t suppose there would be. It\'s\r\nalways proper to be first in one\'s own house. I do so try to be\r\nproper,--and it is such trouble. Talking of people earning their\r\nbread, Alice;--I\'m sure I earn mine. Oh dear!--what fun it would be\r\nto be sitting somewhere in Asia, eating a chicken with one\'s fingers,\r\nand lighting a big fire outside one\'s tent to keep off the lions and\r\ntigers. Fancy your being on one side of the fire and the lions and\r\ntigers on the other, grinning at you through the flames!" Then Lady\r\nGlencora strove to look like a lion, and grinned at herself in the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n"That sort of grin wouldn\'t frighten me," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. I have been reading about it in that woman\'s\r\ntravels. Oh, here they are, and I mustn\'t make any more faces.\r\nDuchess, do come to the fire. I hope you\'ve got warm again. This is\r\nmy cousin, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\nThe Duchess made a stiff little bow of condescension, and then\r\ndeclared that she was charmingly warm. "I don\'t know how you manage\r\nin your house, but the staircases are so comfortable. Now at\r\nLongroyston we\'ve taken all the trouble in the world,--put down\r\nhot-water pipes all over the house, and everything else that could be\r\nthought of, and yet, you can\'t move about the place without meeting\r\nwith draughts at every corner of the passages." The Duchess spoke\r\nwith an enormous emphasis on every other word, sometimes putting so\r\ngreat a stress on some special syllable, as almost to bring her voice\r\nto a whistle. This she had done with the word "pipes" to a great\r\ndegree,--so that Alice never afterwards forgot the hot-water pipes\r\nof Longroyston. "I was telling Lady Glencora, Miss Palliser, that\r\nI never knew a house so warm as this,--or, I\'m sorry to say,"--and\r\nhere the emphasis was very strong on the word sorry,--"so cold as\r\nLongroyston." And the tone in which Longroyston was uttered would\r\nalmost have drawn tears from a critical audience in the pit of a\r\nplayhouse. The Duchess was a woman of about forty, very handsome, but\r\nwith no meaning in her beauty, carrying a good fixed colour in her\r\nface, which did not look like paint, but which probably had received\r\nsome little assistance from art. She was a well-built, sizeable\r\nwoman, with good proportions and fine health,--but a fool. She had\r\naddressed herself to one Miss Palliser; but two Miss Pallisers,\r\ncousins of Plantagenet Palliser, had entered the room at the same\r\ntime, of whom I may say, whatever other traits of character they may\r\nhave possessed, that at any rate they were not fools.\r\n\r\n"It\'s always easy to warm a small house like this," said Miss\r\nPalliser, whose Christian names, unfortunately for her, were\r\nIphigenia Theodata, and who by her cousin and sister was called\r\nIphy--"and I suppose equally difficult to warm a large one such as\r\nLongroyston." The other Miss Palliser had been christened Euphemia.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got no pipes, Duchess, at any rate," said Lady Glencora; and\r\nAlice, as she sat listening, thought she discerned in Lady Glencora\'s\r\npronunciation of the word pipes an almost hidden imitation of the\r\nDuchess\'s whistle. It must have been so, for at the moment Lady\r\nGlencora\'s eye met Alice\'s for an instant, and was then withdrawn, so\r\nthat Alice was compelled to think that her friend and cousin was not\r\nalways quite successful in those struggles she made to be proper.\r\n\r\nThen the gentlemen came in one after another, and other ladies, till\r\nabout thirty people were assembled. Mr. Palliser came up and spoke\r\nanother word to Alice in a kind voice,--meant to express some sense\r\nof connection if not cousinship. "My wife has been thinking so much\r\nof your coming. I hope we shall be able to amuse you." Alice, who had\r\nalready begun to feel desolate, was grateful, and made up her mind\r\nthat she would try to like Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Palliser was almost the last in the room, but directly he\r\nentered Lady Glencora got up from her seat, and met him as he was\r\ncoming into the crowd. "You must take my cousin, Alice Vavasor, in\r\nto dinner," she said, "and;--will you oblige me to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--as you ask me like that."\r\n\r\n"Then try to make her comfortable." After that she introduced them,\r\nand Jeffrey Palliser stood opposite to Alice, talking to her, till\r\ndinner was announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDinner at Matching Priory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice found herself seated near to Lady Glencora\'s end of the table,\r\nand, in spite of her resolution to like Mr. Palliser, she was not\r\nsorry that such an arrangement had been made. Mr. Palliser had taken\r\nthe Duchess out to dinner, and Alice wished to be as far removed\r\nas possible from her Grace. She found herself seated between her\r\nbespoken friend Jeffrey Palliser and the Duke, and as soon as she\r\nwas seated Lady Glencora introduced her to her second neighbour. "My\r\ncousin, Duke," Lady Glencora said, "and a terrible Radical."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed; I\'m glad of that. We\'re sadly in want of a few leading\r\nRadicals, and perhaps I may be able to gain one now."\r\n\r\nAlice thought of her cousin George, and wished that he, instead of\r\nherself, was sitting next to the Duke of St. Bungay. "But I\'m afraid\r\nI never shall be a leading Radical," she said.\r\n\r\n"You shall lead me at any rate, if you will," said he.\r\n\r\n"As the little dogs lead the blind men," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"No, Lady Glencora, not so. But as the pretty women lead the men\r\nwho have eyes in their head. There is nothing I want so much, Miss\r\nVavasor, as to become a Radical;--if I only knew how."\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s very easy to know how," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Do you? I don\'t. I\'ve voted for every liberal measure that has come\r\nseriously before Parliament since I had a seat in either House, and\r\nI\'ve not been able to get beyond Whiggery yet."\r\n\r\n"Have you voted for the ballot?" asked Alice, almost trembling at her\r\nown audacity as she put the question.\r\n\r\n"Well; no, I\'ve not. And I suppose that is the crux. But the ballot\r\nhas never been seriously brought before any House in which I have\r\nsat. I hate it with so keen a private hatred, that I doubt whether\r\nI could vote for it."\r\n\r\n"But the Radicals love it," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Palliser," said the Duke, speaking loudly from his end of the table,\r\n"I\'m told you can never be entitled to call yourself a Radical till\r\nyou\'ve voted for the ballot."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be called a Radical," said Mr. Palliser,--"or to be\r\ncalled anything at all."\r\n\r\n"Except Chancellor of the Exchequer," said Lady Glencora in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s about the finest ambition by which a man can be moved,"\r\nsaid the Duke. "The man who can manage the purse-strings of this\r\ncountry can manage anything." Then that conversation dropped and the\r\nDuke ate his dinner.\r\n\r\n"I was especially commissioned to amuse you," said Mr. Jeffrey\r\nPalliser to Alice. "But when I undertook the task I had no conception\r\nthat you would be calling Cabinet Ministers over the coals about\r\ntheir politics."\r\n\r\n"I did nothing of the kind, surely, Mr. Palliser. I suppose all\r\nRadicals do vote for the ballot, and that\'s why I said it."\r\n\r\n"Your definition was perfectly just, I dare say, only--"\r\n\r\n"Only what?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora need not have been so anxious to provide specially\r\nfor your amusement. Not but what I\'m very much obliged to her,--of\r\ncourse. But Miss Vavasor, unfortunately I\'m not a politician. I\r\nhaven\'t a chance of a seat in the House, and so I despise politics."\r\n\r\n"Women are not allowed to be politicians in this country."\r\n\r\n"Thank God, they can\'t do much in that way;--not directly, I mean.\r\nOnly think where we should be if we had a feminine House of Commons,\r\nwith feminine debates, carried on, of course, with feminine courtesy.\r\nMy cousins Iphy and Phemy there would of course be members. You don\'t\r\nknow them yet?"\r\n\r\n"No; not yet. Are they politicians?"\r\n\r\n"Not especially. They have their tendencies, which are decidedly\r\nliberal. There has never been a Tory Palliser known, you know. But\r\nthey are too clever to give themselves up to anything in which they\r\ncan do nothing. Being women they live a depressed life, devoting\r\nthemselves to literature, fine arts, social economy, and the\r\nabstract sciences. They write wonderful letters; but I believe their\r\ncorrespondence lists are quite full, so that you have no chance at\r\npresent of getting on either of them."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the slightest pretension to ask for such an honour."\r\n\r\n"Oh! if you mean because you don\'t know them, that has nothing to do\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n"But I have no claim either private or public."\r\n\r\n"That has nothing to do with it either. They don\'t at all seek people\r\nof note as their correspondents. Free communication with all the\r\nworld is their motto, and Rowland Hill is the god they worship.\r\nOnly they have been forced to guard themselves against too great an\r\naccession of paper and ink. Are you fond of writing letters, Miss\r\nVavasor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to my friends; but I like getting them better."\r\n\r\n"I shrewdly suspect they don\'t read half what they get. Is it\r\npossible any one should go through two sheets of paper filled by our\r\nfriend the Duchess there? No; their delight is in writing. They sit\r\neach at her desk after breakfast, and go on till lunch. There is a\r\nlittle rivalry between them, not expressed to each other, but visible\r\nto their friends. Iphy certainly does get off the greater number,\r\nand I\'m told crosses quite as often as Phemy, but then she has the\r\nadvantage of a bolder and larger hand."\r\n\r\n"Do they write to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no. I don\'t think they ever write to any relative. They\r\ndon\'t discuss family affairs and such topics as that. Architecture\r\ngoes a long way with them, and whether women ought to be clerks in\r\npublic offices. Iphy has certain American correspondents that take\r\nup much of her time, but she acknowledges she does not read their\r\nletters."\r\n\r\n"Then I certainly shall not write to her."\r\n\r\n"But you are not American, I hope. I do hate the Americans. It\'s the\r\nonly strong political feeling I have. I went there once, and found I\r\ncouldn\'t live with them on any terms."\r\n\r\n"But they please themselves. I don\'t see they are to be hated because\r\nthey don\'t live after our fashion."\r\n\r\n"Oh; it\'s jealousy of course. I know that. I didn\'t come across a\r\ncab-driver who wasn\'t a much better educated man than I am. And as\r\nfor their women, they know everything. But I hated them, and I intend\r\nto hate them. You haven\'t been there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"Then I will make bold to say that any English lady who spent a month\r\nwith them and didn\'t hate them would have very singular tastes. I\r\nbegin to think they\'ll eat each other up, and then there\'ll come an\r\nentirely new set of people of a different sort. I always regarded the\r\nStates as a Sodom and Gomorrah, prospering in wickedness, on which\r\nfire and brimstone were sure to fall sooner or later."\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s wicked."\r\n\r\n"I am wicked, as Topsy used to say. Do you hunt?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Do you shoot?"\r\n\r\n"Shoot! What; with a gun?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I was staying in a house last week with a lady who shot a good\r\ndeal."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t shoot."\r\n\r\n"Do you ride?"\r\n\r\n"No; I wish I did. I have never ridden because I\'ve no one to ride\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"Do you drive?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t drive either."\r\n\r\n"Then what do you do?"\r\n\r\n"I sit at home, and--"\r\n\r\n"Mend your stockings?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t do that, because it\'s disagreeable; but I do work a good\r\ndeal. Sometimes I have amused myself by reading."\r\n\r\n"Ah; they never do that here. I have heard that there is a library,\r\nbut the clue to it has been lost, and nobody now knows the way. I\r\ndon\'t believe in libraries. Nobody ever goes into a library to read,\r\nany more than you would into a larder to eat. But there is this\r\ndifference;--the food you consume does come out of the larders, but\r\nthe books you read never come out of the libraries."\r\n\r\n"Except Mudie\'s," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; he is the great librarian. And you mean to read all the\r\ntime you are here, Miss Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to walk about the priory ruins sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Then you must go by moonlight, and I\'ll go with you. Only isn\'t it\r\nrather late in the year for that?"\r\n\r\n"I should think it is,--for you, Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\nThen the Duke spoke to her again, and she found that she got on very\r\nwell during dinner. But she could not but feel angry with herself\r\nin that she had any fear on the subject;--and yet she could not\r\ndivest herself of that fear. She acknowledged to herself that she was\r\nconscious of a certain inferiority to Lady Glencora and to Mr. Jeffrey\r\nPalliser, which almost made her unhappy. As regarded the Duke on the\r\nother side of her, she had no such feeling. He was old enough to be\r\nher father, and was a Cabinet Minister; therefore he was entitled\r\nto her reverence. But how was it that she could not help accepting\r\nthe other people round her as being indeed superior to herself? Was\r\nshe really learning to believe that she could grow upwards by their\r\nsunlight?\r\n\r\n"Jeffrey is a pleasant fellow, is he not?" said Lady Glencora to her\r\nas they passed back through the billiard-room to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Very pleasant;--a little sarcastic, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I should think you would soon find yourself able to get the better\r\nof that if he tries it upon you," said Lady Glencora; and then the\r\nladies were all in the drawing-room together.\r\n\r\n"It is quite deliciously warm, coming from one room to another," said\r\nthe Duchess, putting her emphasis on the "one" and the "other."\r\n\r\n"Then we had better keep continually moving," said a certain Mrs.\r\nConway Sparkes, a literary lady, who had been very handsome, who was\r\nstill very clever, who was not perhaps very good-natured, and of whom\r\nthe Duchess of St. Bungay was rather afraid.\r\n\r\n"I hope we may be warm here too," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"But not deliciously warm," said Mrs. Conway Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"It makes me tremble in every limb when Mrs. Sparkes attacks her,"\r\nLady Glencora said to Alice in Alice\'s own room that night, "for I\r\nknow she\'ll tell the Duke; and he\'ll tell that tall man with red hair\r\nwhom you see standing about, and the tall man with red hair will tell\r\nMr. Palliser, and then I shall catch it."\r\n\r\n"And who is the tall man with red hair?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a political link between the Duke and Mr. Palliser. His name is\r\nBott, and he\'s a Member of Parliament."\r\n\r\n"But why should he interfere?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s his business. I don\'t quite understand all the ins\r\nand outs of it. I believe he\'s to be one of Mr. Palliser\'s private\r\nsecretaries if he becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer. Perhaps he\r\ndoesn\'t tell;--only I think he does all the same. He always calls me\r\nLady Glen-cowrer. He comes out of Lancashire, and made calico as long\r\nas he could get any cotton." But this happened in the bedroom, and we\r\nmust go back for a while to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had made no answer to Mrs. Sparkes, and so nothing further\r\nwas said about the warmth. Nor, indeed, was there any conversation\r\nthat was comfortably general. The number of ladies in the room was\r\ntoo great for that, and ladies do not divide themselves nicely into\r\nsmall parties, as men and women do when they are mixed. Lady Glencora\r\nbehaved pretty by telling the Duchess all about her pet pheasants;\r\nMrs. Conway Sparkes told ill-natured tales of some one to Miss\r\nEuphemia Palliser; one of the Duchess\'s daughters walked off to a\r\ndistant piano with an admiring friend and touched a few notes; while\r\nIphigenia Palliser boldly took up a book, and placed herself at a\r\ntable. Alice, who was sitting opposite to Lady Glencora, began to\r\nspeculate whether she might do the same; but her courage failed her,\r\nand she sat on, telling herself that she was out of her element.\r\n"Alice Vavasor," said Lady Glencora after a while, suddenly, and in a\r\nsomewhat loud voice, "can you play billiards?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Alice, rather startled.\r\n\r\n"Then you shall learn to-night, and if nobody else will teach you,\r\nyou shall be my pupil." Whereupon Lady Glencora rang the bell and\r\nordered that the billiard-table might be got ready. "You\'ll play,\r\nDuchess, of course," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"It is so nice and warm, that I think I will," said the Duchess; but\r\nas she spoke she looked suspiciously to that part of the room where\r\nMrs. Conway Sparkes was sitting.\r\n\r\n"Let us all play," said Mrs. Conway Sparkes, "and then it will be\r\nnicer,--and perhaps warmer, too."\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen joined them just as they were settling themselves round\r\nthe table, and as many of them stayed there, the billiard-room became\r\nfull. Alice had first a cue put into her hand, and making nothing\r\nof that was permitted to play with a mace. The duty of instructing\r\nher devolved on Jeffrey Palliser, and the next hour passed\r\npleasantly;--not so pleasantly, she thought afterwards, as did some\r\nof those hours in Switzerland when her cousins were with her. After\r\nall, she could get more out of her life with such associates as them,\r\nthan she could with any of these people at Matching. She felt quite\r\nsure of that;--though Jeffrey Palliser did take great trouble to\r\nteach her the game, and once or twice made her laugh heartily by\r\nquizzing the Duchess\'s attitude as she stood up to make her stroke.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could play billiards," said Mrs. Sparkes, on one of these\r\noccasions; "I do indeed."\r\n\r\n"I thought you said you were coming to play," said the Duchess,\r\nalmost majestically, and with a tone of triumph evidently produced\r\nby her own successes.\r\n\r\n"Only to see your Grace," said Mrs. Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that there is anything more to see in me than in\r\nanybody else," said the Duchess. "Mr. Palliser, that was a cannon.\r\nWill you mark that for our side?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Mr. Palliser, that was a cannon."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Duchess, you hit the same ball twice."\r\n\r\n"Very well;--then I suppose Miss Vavasor plays now. That was a miss.\r\nWill you mark that, if you please?" This latter demand was made with\r\ngreat stress, as though she had been defrauded in the matter of the\r\ncannon, and was obeyed. Before long, the Duchess, with her partner,\r\nLady Glencora, won the game,--which fact, however, was, I think,\r\nowing rather to Alice\'s ignorance than to her Grace\'s skill. The\r\nDuchess, however, was very triumphant, and made her way back into the\r\ndrawing-room with a step which seemed to declare loudly that she had\r\ntrumped Mrs. Sparkes at last.\r\n\r\nNot long after this the ladies went up-stairs on their way to bed.\r\nMany of them, perhaps, did not go to their pillows at once, as it was\r\nas yet not eleven o\'clock, and it was past ten when they all came\r\ndown to breakfast. At any rate, Alice, who had been up at seven, did\r\nnot go to bed then, nor for the next two hours. "I\'ll come into your\r\nroom just for one minute," Lady Glencora said as she passed on from\r\nthe door to her own room; and in about five minutes she was back with\r\nher cousin. "Would you mind going into my room--it\'s just there, and\r\nsitting with Ellen for a minute?" This Lady Glencora said in the\r\nsweetest possible tone to the girl who was waiting on Alice; and\r\nthen, when they were alone together, she got into a little chair by\r\nthe fireside and prepared herself for conversation.\r\n\r\n"I must keep you up for a quarter of an hour while I tell you\r\nsomething. But first of all, how do you like the people? Will you\r\nbe able to be comfortable with them?" Alice of course said that\r\nshe thought she would; and then there came that little discussion\r\nin which the duties of Mr. Bott, the man with the red hair, were\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve got something to tell you," said Lady Glencora, when they\r\nhad already been there some twenty minutes. "Sit down opposite to me,\r\nand look at the fire while I look at you."\r\n\r\n"Is it anything terrible?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing wrong."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Glencora, if it\'s--"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have you call me Lady Glencora. Don\'t I call you Alice? Why\r\nare you so unkind to me? I have not come to you now asking you to do\r\nfor me anything that you ought not to do."\r\n\r\n"But you are going to tell me something." Alice felt sure that the\r\nthing to be told would have some reference to Mr. Fitzgerald, and she\r\ndid not wish to hear Mr. Fitzgerald\'s name from her cousin\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Tell you something;--of course I am. I\'m going to tell you\r\nthat,--that in writing to you the other day I wrote a fib. But it\r\nwasn\'t that I wished to deceive you;--only I couldn\'t say it all in\r\na letter."\r\n\r\n"Say all what?"\r\n\r\n"You know I confessed that I had been very bad in not coming to you\r\nin London last year."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of it for a moment."\r\n\r\n"You did not care whether I came or not: was that it? But never mind.\r\nWhy should you have cared? But I cared. I told you in my letter that\r\nI didn\'t come because I had so many things on hand. Of course that\r\nwas a fib."\r\n\r\n"Everybody makes excuses of that kind," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But they don\'t make them to the very people of all others whom\r\nthey want to know and love. I was longing to come to you every day.\r\nBut I feared I could not come without speaking of him;--and I had\r\ndetermined never to speak of him again." This she said in that\r\npeculiar low voice which she assumed at times.\r\n\r\n"Then why do it now, Lady Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be called Lady Glencora. Call me Cora. I had a sister once,\r\nolder than I, and she used to call me Cora. If she had lived--. But\r\nnever mind that now. She didn\'t live. I\'ll tell you why I do it now.\r\nBecause I cannot help it. Besides, I\'ve met him. I\'ve been in the\r\nsame room with him, and have spoken to him. What\'s the good of any\r\nsuch resolution now?"\r\n\r\n"And you have met him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he--Mr. Palliser--knew all about it. When he talked of taking\r\nme to the house, I whispered to him that I thought Burgo would be\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Do not call him by his Christian name," said Alice, almost with a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n"Why not?--why not his Christian name? I did when I told my husband.\r\nOr perhaps I said Burgo Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"And he bade me go. He said it didn\'t signify, and that I had better\r\nlearn to bear it. Bear it, indeed! If I am to meet him, and speak to\r\nhim, and look at him, surely I may mention his name." And then she\r\npaused for an answer. "May I not?"\r\n\r\n"What am I to say?" exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n"Anything you please, that\'s not a falsehood. But I\'ve got you here\r\nbecause I don\'t think you will tell a falsehood. Oh, Alice, I do so\r\nwant to go right, and it is so hard!"\r\n\r\nHard, indeed, poor creature, for one so weighted as she had been, and\r\nsent out into the world with so small advantages of previous training\r\nor of present friendship! Alice began to feel now that she had been\r\nenticed to Matching Priory because her cousin wanted a friend, and\r\nof course she could not refuse to give the friendship that was asked\r\nfrom her. She got up from her chair, and kneeling down at the other\'s\r\nfeet put up her face and kissed her.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would be good to me," said Lady Glencora. "I knew you\r\nwould. And you may say whatever you like. But I could not bear that\r\nyou should not know the real reason why I neither came to you nor\r\nsent for you after we went to London. You\'ll come to me now; won\'t\r\nyou, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and you\'ll come to me," said Alice, making in her mind a sort\r\nof bargain that she was not to be received into Mr. Palliser\'s house\r\nafter the fashion in which Lady Midlothian had proposed to receive\r\nher. But it struck her at once that this was unworthy of her, and\r\nungenerous. "But I\'ll come to you," she added, "whether you come to\r\nme or not."\r\n\r\n"I will go to you," said Lady Glencora, "of course,--why shouldn\'t I?\r\nBut you know what I mean. We shall have dinners and parties and lots\r\nof people."\r\n\r\n"And we shall have none," said Alice, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And therefore there is so much more excuse for your coming to\r\nme;--or rather I mean so much more reason, for I don\'t want excuses.\r\nWell, dear, I\'m so glad I\'ve told you. I was afraid to see you in\r\nLondon. I should hardly have known how to look at you then. But I\'ve\r\ngot over that now." Then she smiled and returned the kiss which Alice\r\nhad given her. It was singular to see her standing on the bedroom rug\r\nwith all her magnificence of dress, but with her hair pushed back\r\nbehind her ears, and her eyes red with tears,--as though the burden\r\nof the magnificence remained to her after its purpose was over.\r\n\r\n"I declare it\'s ever so much past twelve. Good night, now, dear. I\r\nwonder whether he\'s come up. But I should have heard his step if he\r\nhad. He never treads lightly. He seldom gives over work till after\r\none, and sometimes goes on till three. It\'s the only thing he likes,\r\nI believe. God bless you! good night. I\'ve such a deal more to say to\r\nyou; and Alice, you must tell me something about yourself, too; won\'t\r\nyou, dear?" Then without waiting for an answer Lady Glencora went,\r\nleaving Alice in a maze of bewilderment. She could hardly believe\r\nthat all she had heard, and all she had done, had happened since she\r\nleft Queen Anne Street that morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThree Politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser was one of those politicians in possessing whom England\r\nhas perhaps more reason to be proud than of any other of her\r\nresources, and who, as a body, give to her that exquisite combination\r\nof conservatism and progress which is her present strength and best\r\nsecurity for the future. He could afford to learn to be a statesman,\r\nand had the industry wanted for such training. He was born in the\r\npurple, noble himself, and heir to the highest rank as well as one of\r\nthe greatest fortunes of the country, already very rich, surrounded\r\nby all the temptations of luxury and pleasure; and yet he devoted\r\nhimself to work with the grinding energy of a young penniless\r\nbarrister labouring for a penniless wife, and did so without any\r\nmotive more selfish than that of being counted in the roll of\r\nthe public servants of England. He was not a brilliant man, and\r\nunderstood well that such was the case. He was now listened to in\r\nthe House, as the phrase goes; but he was listened to as a laborious\r\nman, who was in earnest in what he did, who got up his facts with\r\naccuracy, and who, dull though he be, was worthy of confidence. And\r\nhe was very dull. He rather prided himself on being dull, and on\r\nconquering in spite of his dullness. He never allowed himself a\r\njoke in his speeches, nor attempted even the smallest flourish of\r\nrhetoric. He was very careful in his language, labouring night and\r\nday to learn to express himself with accuracy, with no needless\r\nrepetition of words, perspicuously with regard to the special object\r\nhe might have in view. He had taught himself to believe that oratory,\r\nas oratory, was a sin against that honesty in politics by which he\r\nstrove to guide himself. He desired to use words for the purpose of\r\nteaching things which he knew and which others did not know; and he\r\ndesired also to be honoured for his knowledge. But he had no desire\r\nto be honoured for the language in which his knowledge was conveyed.\r\nHe was an upright, thin, laborious man; who by his parts alone could\r\nhave served no political party materially, but whose parts were\r\nsufficient to make his education, integrity, and industry useful in\r\nthe highest degree. It is the trust which such men inspire which\r\nmakes them so serviceable;--trust not only in their labour,--for any\r\nman rising from the mass of the people may be equally laborious; nor\r\nyet simply in their honesty and patriotism. The confidence is given\r\nto their labour, honesty, and patriotism joined to such a personal\r\nstake in the country as gives them a weight and ballast which no\r\npolitician in England can possess without it.\r\n\r\nIf he was dull as a statesman he was more dull in private life, and\r\nit may be imagined that such a woman as his wife would find some\r\ndifficulty in making his society the source of her happiness. Their\r\nmarriage, in a point of view regarding business, had been a complete\r\nsuccess,--and a success, too, when on the one side, that of Lady\r\nGlencora, there had been terrible dangers of shipwreck, and when\r\non his side also there had been some little fears of a mishap. As\r\nregards her it has been told how near she went to throwing herself,\r\nwith all her vast wealth, into the arms of a young man, whom no\r\nfather, no guardian could have regarded as a well-chosen husband for\r\nany girl;--one who as yet had shown no good qualities, who had been\r\na spendthrift, unprincipled, and debauched. Alas, she had loved him!\r\nIt is possible that her love and her wealth might have turned him\r\nfrom evil to good. But who would have ventured to risk her,--I will\r\nnot say her and her vast inheritances,--on such a chance? That evil,\r\nhowever, had been prevented, and those about her had managed to marry\r\nher to a young man, very steady by nature, with worldly prospects as\r\nbrilliant as her own, and with a station than which the world offers\r\nnothing higher. His little threatened mischance,--a passing fancy for\r\na married lady who was too wise to receive vows which were proffered\r\nnot in the most ardent manner,--had, from special reasons, given some\r\nlittle alarm to his uncle, which had just sufficed at the time to\r\nmake so very judicious a marriage doubly pleasant to that noble duke,\r\nSo that all things and all people had conspired to shower substantial\r\ncomforts on the heads of this couple, when they were joined together,\r\nand men and women had not yet ceased to declare how happy were both\r\nin the accumulated gifts of fortune.\r\n\r\nAnd as regards Mr. Palliser, I think that his married life, and the\r\nwife, whom he certainly had not chosen, but who had dropped upon him,\r\nsuited him admirably. He wanted great wealth for that position at\r\nwhich he aimed. He had been rich before his marriage with his own\r\nwealth,--so rich that he could throw thousands away if he wished it;\r\nbut for him and his career was needed that colossal wealth which\r\nwould make men talk about it,--which would necessitate an expansive\r\nexpenditure, reaching far and wide, doing nothing, or less than\r\nnothing, for his own personal comfort, but giving to him at once that\r\nrock-like solidity which is so necessary to our great aristocratic\r\npoliticians. And his wife was, as far as he knew, all that he\r\ndesired. He had not dabbled much in the fountains of Venus, though\r\nhe had forgotten himself once, and sinned in coveting another man\'s\r\nwife. But his sin then had hardly polluted his natural character,\r\nand his desire had been of a kind which was almost more gratified in\r\nits disappointment than it would have been in its fruition. On the\r\nmorning after the lady had frowned on him he had told himself that he\r\nwas very well out of that trouble. He knew that it would never be for\r\nhim to hang up on the walls of a temple a well-worn lute as a votive\r\noffering when leaving the pursuits of love. _Idoneus puellis_ he\r\nnever could have been. So he married Lady Glencora and was satisfied.\r\nThe story of Burgo Fitzgerald was told to him, and he supposed that\r\nmost girls had some such story to tell. He thought little about it,\r\nand by no means understood her when she said to him, with all the\r\nimpressiveness which she could throw into the words, "You must know\r\nthat I have really loved him." "You must love me now," he had replied\r\nwith a smile; and then as regarded his mind, the thing was over. And\r\nsince his marriage he had thought that things matrimonial had gone\r\nwell with him, and with her too. He gave her almost unlimited power\r\nof enjoying her money, and interfered but little in her way of\r\nlife. Sometimes he would say a word of caution to her with reference\r\nto those childish ways which hardly became the dull dignity of\r\nhis position; and his words then would have in them something of\r\nunintentional severity,--whether instigated or not by the red-haired\r\nRadical Member of Parliament, I will not pretend to say;--but on\r\nthe whole he was contented and loved his wife, as he thought, very\r\nheartily, and at least better than he loved any one else. One cause\r\nof unhappiness, or rather one doubt as to his entire good fortune,\r\nwas beginning to make itself felt, as his wife had to her sorrow\r\nalready discovered. He had hoped that before this he might have heard\r\nthat she would give him a child. But the days were young yet for that\r\ntrouble, and the care had not become a sorrow.\r\n\r\nBut this judicious arrangement as to properties, this well-ordered\r\nalliance between families, had not perhaps suited her as well as it\r\nhad suited him. I think that she might have learned to forget her\r\nearly lover, or to look back upon it with a soft melancholy hardly\r\namounting to regret, had her new lord been more tender in his ways\r\nwith her. I do not know that Lady Glencora\'s heart was made of that\r\nstern stuff which refuses to change its impressions; but it was a\r\nheart, and it required food. To love and fondle someone,--to be\r\nloved and fondled, were absolutely necessary to her happiness. She\r\nwanted the little daily assurance of her supremacy in the man\'s\r\nfeelings, the constant touch of love, half accidental half contrived,\r\nthe passing glance of the eye telling perhaps of some little joke\r\nunderstood only between them two rather than of love, the softness of\r\nan occasional kiss given here and there when chance might bring them\r\ntogether, some half-pretended interest in her little doings, a nod, a\r\nwink, a shake of the head, or even a pout. It should have been given\r\nto her to feed upon such food as this daily, and then she would have\r\nforgotten Burgo Fitzgerald. But Mr. Palliser understood none of these\r\nthings; and therefore the image of Burgo Fitzgerald in all his beauty\r\nwas ever before her eyes.\r\n\r\nBut not the less was Mr. Palliser a prosperous man, as to the success\r\nof whose career few who knew him had much doubt. It might be written\r\nin the book of his destiny that he would have to pass through some\r\nviolent domestic trouble, some ruin in the hopes of his home, of a\r\nnature to destroy then and for ever the worldly prospects of other\r\nmen. But he was one who would pass through such violence, should\r\nit come upon him, without much scathe. To lose his influence with\r\nhis party would be worse to him than to lose his wife, and public\r\ndisgrace would hit him harder than private dishonour.\r\n\r\nAnd the present was the very moment in which success was, as was\r\nsaid, coming to him. He had already held laborious office under the\r\nCrown, but had never sat in the Cabinet. He had worked much harder\r\nthan Cabinet Ministers generally work,--but hitherto had worked\r\nwithout any reward that was worth his having. For the stipend which\r\nhe had received had been nothing to him,--as the great stipend which\r\nhe would receive, if his hopes were true, would also be nothing to\r\nhim. To have ascendancy over other men, to be known by his countrymen\r\nas one of their real rulers, to have an actual and acknowledged voice\r\nin the management of nations,--those were the rewards for which he\r\nlooked; and now in truth it seemed as though they were coming to him.\r\nIt was all but known that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nwould separate himself from the Government, carrying various others\r\nwith him, either before or immediately consequent on the meeting\r\nof Parliament;--and it was all but known, also, that Mr. Palliser\r\nwould fill his place, taking that high office at once, although he\r\nhad never hitherto sat in that august assembly which men call the\r\nCabinet. He could thus afford to put up with the small everyday\r\ncalamity of having a wife who loved another man better than she loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Duke of St. Bungay at Matching was assumed to be a\r\nsure sign of Mr. Palliser\'s coming triumph. The Duke was a statesman\r\nof a very different class, but he also had been eminently successful\r\nas an aristocratic pillar of the British Constitutional Republic. He\r\nwas a minister of very many years\' standing, being as used to cabinet\r\nsittings as other men are to their own armchairs; but he had never\r\nbeen a hard-working man. Though a constant politician, he had ever\r\ntaken politics easy whether in office or out. The world had said\r\nbefore now that the Duke might be Premier, only that he would not\r\ntake the trouble. He had been consulted by a very distinguished\r\nperson,--so the papers had said more than once,--as to the making of\r\nPrime Ministers. His voice in council was esteemed to be very great.\r\nHe was regarded as a strong rock of support to the liberal cause, and\r\nyet nobody ever knew what he did; nor was there much record of what\r\nhe said. The offices which he held, or had held, were generally those\r\nto which no very arduous duties were attached. In severe debates he\r\nnever took upon himself the brunt of opposition oratory. What he said\r\nin the House was generally short and pleasant,--with some slight,\r\ndrolling, undercurrent of uninjurious satire running through it. But\r\nhe was a walking miracle of the wisdom of common sense. He never lost\r\nhis temper. He never made mistakes. He never grew either hot or cold\r\nin a cause. He was never reckless in politics, and never cowardly. He\r\nsnubbed no man, and took snubbings from no man. He was a Knight of\r\nthe Garter, a Lord Lieutenant of his county, and at sixty-two had\r\nhis digestion unimpaired and his estate in excellent order. He was a\r\ngreat buyer of pictures, which, perhaps, he did not understand, and a\r\ngreat collector of books which certainly he never read. All the world\r\nrespected him, and he was a man to whom the respect of all the world\r\nwas as the breath of his nostrils.\r\n\r\nBut even he was not without his peacock on the wall, his skeleton\r\nin the closet, his thorn in his side; though the peacock did not\r\nscream loud, the skeleton was not very terrible in his anatomical\r\narrangement, nor was the thorn likely to fester to a gangrene. The\r\nDuke was always in awe about his wife.\r\n\r\nHe was ever uneasy about his wife, but it must not be supposed\r\nthat he feared the machinations of any Burgo Fitzgerald as being\r\ndestructive of his domestic comfort. The Duchess was and always\r\nhad been all that is proper. Ladies in high rank, when gifted with\r\nexcelling beauty, have often been made the marks of undeserved\r\ncalumny;--but no breath of slander had ever touched her name. I doubt\r\nif any man alive had ever had the courage even to wink at her since\r\nthe Duke had first called her his own. Nor was she a spendthrift, or\r\na gambler. She was not fast in her tastes, or given to any pursuit\r\nthat was objectionable. She was simply a fool, and as a fool was ever\r\nfearing that she was the mark of ridicule. In all such miseries she\r\nwould complain sorrowfully, piteously, and occasionally very angrily,\r\nto her dear Duke and protector; till sometimes her dear Duke did not\r\nquite know what to do with her or how to protect her. It did not suit\r\nhim, a Knight of the Garter and a Duke of St. Bungay, to beg mercy\r\nfor that poor wife of his from such a one as Mrs. Conway Sparkes; nor\r\nwould it be more in his way to lodge a formal complaint against that\r\nlady before his host or hostess,--as one boy at school may sometimes\r\ndo as regards another. "If you don\'t like the people, my dear, we\r\nwill go away," he said to her late on that evening of which we have\r\nspoken. "No," she replied, "I do not wish to go away. I have said\r\nthat we would stay till December, and Longroyston won\'t be ready\r\nbefore that. But I think that something ought to be done to silence\r\nthat woman." And the accent came strong upon "something," and then\r\nagain with terrific violence upon "woman."\r\n\r\nThe Duke did not know how to silence Mrs. Conway Sparkes. It was\r\na great principle of his life never to be angry with any one. How\r\ncould he get at Mrs. Conway Sparkes? "I don\'t think she is worth your\r\nattention," said the husband. "That\'s all very well, Duke," said the\r\nwife, "and perhaps she is not. But I find her in this house, and I\r\ndon\'t like to be laughed at. I think Lady Glencora should make her\r\nknow her place."\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora is very young, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about being so very young," said the Duchess, whose ear\r\nhad perhaps caught some little hint of poor Lady Glencora\'s almost\r\nunintentional mimicry. Now as appeals of this kind were being made\r\nfrequently to the Duke, and as he was often driven to say some word,\r\nof which he himself hardly approved, to some one in protection of his\r\nDuchess, he was aware that the matter was an annoyance, and at times\r\nalmost wished that her Grace was at--Longroyston.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a third politician staying at Matching Priory who had\r\nnever yet risen to the rank of a statesman, but who had his hopes.\r\nThis was Mr. Bott, the member for St. Helens, whom Lady Glencora had\r\ndescribed as a man who stood about, with red hair,--and perhaps told\r\ntales of her to her husband. Mr. Bott was a person who certainly had\r\nhad some success in life and who had won it for himself. He was not\r\nvery young, being at this time only just on the right side of fifty.\r\nHe was now enjoying his second session in Parliament, having been\r\nreturned as a pledged disciple of the Manchester school. Nor had he\r\napparently been false to his pledges. At St. Helens he was still held\r\nto be a good man and true. But they who sat on the same side with\r\nhim in the House and watched his political manoeuvres, knew that he\r\nwas striving hard to get his finger into the public pie. He was not\r\na rich man, though he had made calico and had got into Parliament.\r\nAnd though he claimed to be a thoroughgoing Radical, he was a man\r\nwho liked to live with aristocrats, and was fond of listening to the\r\nwhispers of such as the Duke of St. Bungay or Mr. Palliser. It was\r\nsupposed that he did understand something of finance. He was at any\r\nrate great in figures; and as he was possessed of much industry, and\r\nwas obedient withal, he was a man who might make himself useful to a\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer ambitious of changes.\r\n\r\nThere are men who get into such houses as Matching Priory and whose\r\npresence there is a mystery to many;--as to whom the ladies of the\r\nhouse never quite understand why they are entertaining such a guest.\r\n"And Mr. Bott is coming," Mr. Palliser had said to his wife. "Mr.\r\nBott!" Lady Glencora had answered. "Goodness me! who is Mr. Bott?"\r\n"He is member for St. Helens," said Mr. Palliser. "A very serviceable\r\nman in his way." "And what am I to do with him?" asked Lady Glencora.\r\n"I don\'t know that you can do anything with him. He is a man who\r\nhas a great deal of business, and I dare say he will spend most of\r\nhis time in the library." So Mr. Bott arrived. But though a huge\r\npile of letters and papers came to him every morning by post, he\r\nunfortunately did not seem to spend much of his time in the library.\r\nPerhaps he had not found the clue to that lost apartment. Twice he\r\nwent out shooting, but as on the first day he shot the keeper, and\r\non the second very nearly shot the Duke, he gave that up. Hunting he\r\ndeclined, though much pressed to make an essay in that art by Jeffrey\r\nPalliser. He seemed to spend his time, as Lady Glencora said, in\r\nstanding about,--except at certain times when he was closeted with\r\nMr. Palliser, and when, it may be presumed, he made himself useful.\r\nOn such days he would be seen at the hour of lunch with fingers\r\nmuch stained with ink, and it was generally supposed that on those\r\noccasions he had been counting up taxes and calculating the effect\r\nof great financial changes. He was a tall, wiry, strong man, with a\r\nbald head and bristly red beard, which, however, was cut off from his\r\nupper and under lip. This was unfortunate, as had he hidden his mouth\r\nhe would not have been in so marked a degree an ugly man. His upper\r\nlip was very long, and his mouth was mean. But he had found that\r\nwithout the help of a razor to these parts he could not manage his\r\nsoup to his satisfaction, and preferring cleanliness to beauty had\r\nshaved himself accordingly.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t dislike Mr. Bott so much," Lady Glencora said to her\r\nhusband, "if he didn\'t rub his hands and smile so often, and seem\r\nto be going to say something when he really is not going to say\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you need trouble yourself about him, my dear," Mr.\r\nPalliser had answered.\r\n\r\n"But when he looks at me in that way, I can\'t help stopping, as\r\nI think he is going to speak; and then he always says, \'Can I do\r\nanything for you, Lady Glen-cowrer?\'"\r\n\r\nShe instantly saw that her husband did not like this. "Don\'t be angry\r\nwith me, dear," she said. "You must admit that he is rather a bore."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all angry, Glencora," said the husband; "and if you\r\ninsist upon it, I will see that he leaves;--and in such case will\r\nof course never ask him again. But that might be prejudicial to me,\r\nas he is a man whom I trust in politics, and who may perhaps be\r\nserviceable to me."\r\n\r\nOf course Lady Glencora declared that Mr. Bott might remain as long as\r\nhe and her husband desired, and of course she mentioned his name no\r\nmore to Mr. Palliser; but from that time forth she regarded Mr. Bott as\r\nan enemy, and felt also that Mr. Bott regarded her in the same light.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known among outside politicians that the Duke of St.\r\nBungay was staying at Matching Priory, outside politicians became\r\nmore sure than ever that Mr. Palliser would be the new Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer. The old minister and the young minister were of course\r\narranging matters together. But I doubt whether Mr. Palliser and the\r\nDuke ever spoke on any such topic during the entire visit. Though\r\nMr. Bott was occasionally closeted with Mr. Palliser, the Duke never\r\ntroubled himself with such closetings. He went out shooting--on his\r\npony, read his newspaper, wrote his notes, and looked with the eye\r\nof a connoisseur over all Mr. Palliser\'s farming apparatus. "You seem\r\nto have a good man, I should say," said the Duke. "What! Hubbings?\r\nYes;--he was a legacy from my uncle when he gave me up the Priory."\r\n"A very good man, I should say. Of course he won\'t make it pay; but\r\nhe\'ll make it look as though it did;--which is the next best thing.\r\nI could never get rent out of land that I farmed myself,--never." "I\r\nsuppose not," said Mr. Palliser, who did not care much about it. The\r\nDuke would have talked to him by the hour together about farming had\r\nMr. Palliser been so minded; but he talked to him very little about\r\npolitics. Nor during the whole time of his stay at Matching did the\r\nDuke make any other allusion to Mr. Palliser\'s hopes as regarded\r\nthe ministry, than that in which he had told Lady Glencora at the\r\ndinner-table that her husband\'s ambition was the highest by which\r\nany man could be moved.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bott was sometimes honoured by a few words with the Duke.\r\n\r\n"We shall muster pretty strong, your Grace," Mr. Bott had said to him\r\none day before dinner.\r\n\r\n"That depends on how the changes go," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there will be a change?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; there\'ll be a change,--certainly, I should say. And it will\r\nbe in your direction."\r\n\r\n"And in Palliser\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I should think so;--that is, if it suits him. By-the-by, Mr.\r\nBott--" Then there was a little whispered communication, in which\r\nperhaps Mr. Bott was undertaking some commission of that nature which\r\nLady Glencora had called "telling."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nIn Which Much of the History of the Pallisers Is Told.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten days Alice found herself quite comfortable at\r\nMatching Priory. She had now promised to remain there till the second\r\nweek of December, at which time she was to go to Vavasor Hall,--there\r\nto meet her father and Kate. The Pallisers were to pass their\r\nChristmas with the Duke of Omnium in Barsetshire. "We always are\r\nto do that," said Glencora. "It is the state occasion at Gatherum\r\nCastle, but it only lasts for one week. Then we go somewhere else.\r\nOh dear!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you say \'oh dear\'?"\r\n\r\n"Because--; I don\'t think I mean to tell you."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m sure I won\'t ask."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so like you, Alice. But I can be as firm as you, and I\'m sure\r\nI won\'t tell you unless you do ask." But Alice did not ask, and it\r\nwas not long before Lady Glencora\'s firmness gave way.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, Alice had become quite comfortable at Matching\r\nPriory. Perhaps she was already growing upwards towards the light.\r\nAt any rate she could listen with pleasure to the few words the Duke\r\nwould say to her. She could even chat a little to the Duchess,--so\r\nthat her Grace had observed to Lady Glencora that "her cousin was a\r\nvery nice person,--a very nice person indeed. What a pity it was that\r\nshe had been so ill-treated by that gentleman in Oxfordshire!" Lady\r\nGlencora had to explain that the gentleman lived in Cambridgeshire,\r\nand that he, at any rate, had not treated anybody ill. "Do you mean\r\nthat she--jilted him?" said the Duchess, almost whistling, and\r\nopening her eyes very wide. "Dear me, I\'m sorry for that. I shouldn\'t\r\nhave thought it." And when she next spoke to Alice she assumed rather\r\na severe tone of emphasis;--but this was soon abandoned when Alice\r\nlistened to her with complacency.\r\n\r\nAlice also had learned to ride,--or rather had resumed her riding,\r\nwhich for years had been abandoned. Jeffrey Palliser had been her\r\nsquire, and she had become intimate with him so as to learn to\r\nquarrel with him and to like him,--to such an extent that Lady\r\nGlencora had laughingly told her that she was going to do more.\r\n\r\n"I rather think not," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But what has thinking to do with it? Who ever thinks about it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t just at present,--at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word it would be very nice;--and then perhaps some day you\'d\r\nbe the Duchess."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, don\'t talk such nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Those are the speculations which people make. Only I should spite\r\nyou by killing myself, so that he might marry again."\r\n\r\n"How can you say such horrid things?"\r\n\r\n"I think I shall,--some day. What right have I to stand in his way?\r\nHe spoke to me the other day about Jeffrey\'s altered position, and I\r\nknew what he meant;--or rather what he didn\'t mean to say, but what\r\nhe thought. But I shan\'t kill myself."\r\n\r\n"I should think not."\r\n\r\n"I only know one other way," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"You are thinking of things which should never be in your thoughts,"\r\nsaid Alice vehemently. "Have you no trust in God\'s providence? Cannot\r\nyou accept what has been done for you?"\r\n\r\nMr. Bott had gone away, much to Lady Glencora\'s delight, but had\r\nunfortunately come back again. On his return Alice heard more of the\r\nfeud between the Duchess and Mrs. Conway Sparkes. "I did not tell\r\nyou," said Lady Glencora to her friend;--"I did not tell you before\r\nhe went that I was right about his tale-bearing."\r\n\r\n"And did he bear tales?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did get the scolding, and I know very well that it came\r\nthrough him, though Mr. Palliser did not say so. But he told me that\r\nthe Duchess had felt herself hurt by that other woman\'s way of\r\ntalking."\r\n\r\n"But it was not your fault."\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s what I said. It was he who desired me to ask Mrs. Conway\r\nSparkes to come here. I didn\'t want her. She goes everywhere, and it\r\nis thought a catch to get her; but if she had been drowned in the Red\r\nSea I shouldn\'t have minded. When I told him that, he said it was\r\nnonsense,--which of course it was; and then he said I ought to make\r\nher hold her tongue. Of course I said I couldn\'t. Mrs. Conway Sparkes\r\nwouldn\'t care for me. If she quizzed me, myself, I told him that\r\nI could take care of myself, though she were ten times Mrs. Conway\r\nSparkes, and had written finer poetry than Tennyson."\r\n\r\n"It is fine;--some of it," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I dare say! I know a great deal of it by heart, only I wouldn\'t\r\ngive her the pleasure of supposing that I had ever thought so much\r\nabout her poetry. And then I told him that I couldn\'t take care of\r\nthe Duchess,--and he told me that I was a child."\r\n\r\n"He only meant that in love."\r\n\r\n"I am a child; I know that. Why didn\'t he marry some strong-minded,\r\nferocious woman that could keep his house in order, and frown Mrs.\r\nSparkes out of her impudence? It wasn\'t my fault."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t tell him that."\r\n\r\n"But I did. Then he kissed me, and said it was all right, and told me\r\nthat I should grow older. \'And Mrs. Sparkes will grow more impudent,\'\r\nI said, \'and the Duchess more silly.\' And after that I went away. Now\r\nthis horrid Mr. Bott has come back again, and only that it would be\r\nmean in me to condescend so far, I would punish him. He grins and\r\nsmiles at me, and rubs his big hands more than ever, because he feels\r\nthat he has behaved badly. Is it not horrid to have to live in the\r\nhouse with such people?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you need mind him much."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I am the mistress here, and am told that I am to entertain\r\nthe people. Fancy entertaining the Duchess of St. Bungay and Mr. Bott!"\r\n\r\nAlice had now become so intimate with Lady Glencora that she did not\r\nscruple to read her wise lectures,--telling her that she allowed\r\nherself to think too much of little things,--and too much also of\r\nsome big things. "As regards Mr. Bott," said Alice, "I think you\r\nshould bear it as though there were no such person."\r\n\r\n"But that would be pretence,--especially to you."\r\n\r\n"No; it would not be pretence; it would be the reticence which all\r\nwomen should practise,--and you, in your position, more almost than\r\nany other woman." Then Lady Glencora pouted, told Alice that it was\r\na pity she had not married Mr. Palliser, and left her.\r\n\r\nThat evening,--the evening of Mr. Bott\'s return to Matching, that\r\ngentleman found a place near to Alice in the drawing-room. He had\r\noften come up to her, rubbing his hands together, and saying little\r\nwords, as though there was some reason from their positions that they\r\ntwo should be friends. Alice had perceived this, and had endeavoured\r\nwith all her force to shake him off; but he was a man, who if he\r\nunderstood a hint, never took it. A cold shoulder was nothing to\r\nhim, if he wanted to gain the person who showed it him. His code\r\nof perseverance taught him that it was a virtue to overcome cold\r\nshoulders. The man or woman who received his first overtures with\r\ngrace would probably be one on whom it would be better that he should\r\nlook down and waste no further time; whereas he or she who could\r\nafford to treat him with disdain would no doubt be worth gaining.\r\nSuch men as Mr. Bott are ever gracious to cold shoulders. The colder\r\nthe shoulders, the more gracious are the Mr. Botts.\r\n\r\n"What a delightful person is our dear friend, Lady Glencora!" said\r\nMr. Bott, having caught Alice in a position from which she could not\r\nreadily escape.\r\n\r\nAlice had half a mind to differ, or to make any remark that might\r\nrid her from Mr. Bott. But she did not dare to say a word that might\r\nseem to have been said playfully. "Yes, indeed," she replied. "How\r\nvery cold it is to-night!" She was angry with herself for her own\r\nstupidity as soon as the phrase was out of her mouth, and then she\r\nalmost laughed as she thought of the Duchess and the hot-water pipes\r\nat Longroyston.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is cold. You and her ladyship are great friends, I believe,\r\nMiss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"She is my cousin," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes; that is so pleasant. I have reason to know that Mr. Palliser\r\nis very much gratified that you should be so much with her."\r\n\r\nThis was unbearable. Alice could not quite assume sufficient courage\r\nto get up from her chair and walk away from him, and yet she felt\r\nthat she must escape further conversation. "I don\'t know that I am\r\nvery much with her, and if I were I can\'t think it would make any\r\ndifference to Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bott was not a man to be put down when he had a purpose in\r\nhand. "I can assure you that those are his sentiments. Of course we\r\nall know that dear Lady Glencora is young. She is very young."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott, I really would rather not talk about my cousin."\r\n\r\n"But, dear Miss Vavasor;--when we both have her welfare in view--?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t her welfare in view, Mr. Bott; not in the least. There is\r\nno reason why I should. You must excuse me if I say I cannot talk\r\nabout her welfare with a perfect stranger." Then she did get up,\r\nand went away from the Member of Parliament, leaving him rather\r\nastonished at her audacity. But he was a constant man, and his inner\r\nresolve was simply to the effect that he would try it again.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether Jeffrey Palliser did think much of the difference\r\nbetween his present position and that which would have been his had\r\nLady Glencora been the happy possessor of a cradle up-stairs with a\r\nboy in it. I suppose he must have done so. It is hardly possible that\r\nany man should not be alive to the importance of such a chance. His\r\nown present position was one of the most unfortunate which can fall\r\nto the lot of a man. His father, the Duke\'s youngest brother, had\r\nleft him about six hundred a year, and had left him also a taste\r\nfor living with people of six thousand. The propriety of earning\r\nhis bread had never been put before him. His father had been in\r\nParliament, and had been the most favoured son of the old Duke, who\r\nfor some years before his death had never spoken to him who now\r\nreigned over the house of the Pallisers. Jeffrey\'s father had been\r\nbrought up at Matching Priory as scions of ducal houses are brought\r\nup, and on the old man\'s death had been possessed of means sufficient\r\nto go on in the same path, though with difficulty. His brother had\r\ndone something for him, and at various times he had held some place\r\nnear the throne. But on his death, when the property left behind him\r\nwas divided between his son and three daughters, Jeffrey Palliser\r\nbecame possessed of the income above stated. Of course he could live\r\non it,--and as during the winter months of the year a home was found\r\nfor him free of cost, he could keep hunters, and live as rich men\r\nlive. But he was a poor, embarrassed man, without prospects,--until\r\nthis fine ducal prospect became opened to him by the want of that\r\ncradle at Matching Priory.\r\n\r\nBut the prospect was no doubt very distant. Lady Glencora might yet\r\nhave as many sons as Hecuba. Or she might die, and some other more\r\nfortunate lady might become the mother of his cousin\'s heir. Or the\r\nDuke might marry and have a son. And, moreover, his cousin was only\r\none year older than himself, and the great prize, if it came his way,\r\nmight not come for forty years as yet. Nevertheless his hand might\r\nnow be acceptable in quarters where it would certainly be rejected\r\nhad Lady Glencora possessed that cradle up-stairs. We cannot but\r\nsuppose that he must have made some calculations of this nature.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity you should do nothing all your life," his cousin\r\nPlantagenet said to him one morning just at this time. Jeffrey had\r\nsought the interview in his cousin\'s room, and I fear had done so\r\nwith some slight request for ready money.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do?" said Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n"At any rate you might marry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--I could marry. There\'s no man so poor but what he can do\r\nthat. The question would be how I might like the subsequent\r\nstarvation."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that you need starve. Though your own fortune is small,\r\nit is something,--and many girls have fortunes of their own."\r\n\r\nJeffrey thought of Lady Glencora, but he made no allusion to her in\r\nspeech. "I don\'t think I\'m very good at that kind of thing," he said.\r\n"When the father and mother came to ask of my house and my home I\r\nshould break down. I don\'t say it as praising myself;--indeed, quite\r\nthe reverse; but I fear I have not a mercenary tendency."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; quite so. I admit that."\r\n\r\n"Men must have mercenary tendencies or they would not have bread. The\r\nman who ploughs that he may live does so because he, luckily, has a\r\nmercenary tendency."\r\n\r\n"Just so. But you see I am less lucky than the ploughman."\r\n\r\n"There is no vulgar error so vulgar,--that is to say, common or\r\nerroneous, as that by which men have been taught to say that\r\nmercenary tendencies are bad. A desire for wealth is the source\r\nof all progress. Civilization comes from what men call greed. Let\r\nyour mercenary tendencies be combined with honesty and they cannot\r\ntake you astray." This the future Chancellor of the Exchequer said\r\nwith much of that air and tone of wisdom which a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer ought to possess.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t got any such tendencies," said Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to occupy a farm in Scotland?" said Plantagenet\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n"And pay rent?"\r\n\r\n"You would have to pay rent of course."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no. It would be dishonest, as I know I should never pay\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You are too old, I fear, for the public service."\r\n\r\n"You mean a desk in the Treasury,--with a hundred a year. Yes; I\r\nthink I am too old."\r\n\r\n"But have you no plan of your own?"\r\n\r\n"Not much of one. Sometimes I have thought I would go to New\r\nZealand."\r\n\r\n"You would have to be a farmer there."\r\n\r\n"No;--I shouldn\'t do that. I should get up an opposition to the\r\nGovernment and that sort of thing, and then they would buy me off and\r\ngive me a place."\r\n\r\n"That does very well here, Jeffrey, if a man can get into Parliament\r\nand has capital enough to wait; but I don\'t think it would do out\r\nthere. Would you like to go into Parliament?"\r\n\r\n"What; here? Of course I should. Only I should be sure to get\r\nterribly into debt. I don\'t owe very much, now,--not to speak\r\nof,--except what I owe you."\r\n\r\n"You owe nothing to me," said Plantagenet, with some little touch of\r\nmagniloquence in his tone. "No; don\'t speak of it. I have no brother,\r\nand between you and me it means nothing. You see, Jeffrey, it may\r\nbe that I shall have to look to you as my--my--my heir, in short."\r\nHereupon Jeffrey muttered something as to the small probability of\r\nsuch necessity, and as to the great remoteness of any result even if\r\nit were so.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all true," said the elder heir of the Pallisers, "but\r\nstill--. In short, I wish you would do something. Do you think about\r\nit; and then some day speak to me again."\r\n\r\nJeffrey, as he left his cousin with a cheque for L500 in his\r\nwaist-coat pocket, thought that the interview which had at one\r\ntime taken important dimensions, had not been concluded altogether\r\nsatisfactorily. A seat in Parliament! Yes, indeed! If his cousin\r\nwould so far use his political, monetary, or ducal interest as to\r\ndo that for him;--as to give him something of the status properly\r\nbelonging to the younger son of the House, then indeed life would\r\nhave some charms for him! But as for the farm in Scotland, or a desk\r\nat an office in London,--his own New Zealand plan would be better\r\nthan those. And then as he went along of course he bethought himself\r\nthat it might be his lot yet to die, and at least to be buried, in\r\nthe purple, as a Duke of Omnium. If so, certainly it would be his\r\nduty to prepare another heir, and leave a duke behind him,--if it\r\nwere possible.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to ride with us after lunch?" said Lady Glencora to\r\nhim as he strolled into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"No," said Jeffrey; "I\'m going to study."\r\n\r\n"To do what?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"To study;--or rather I shall spend to-day in sitting down and\r\nconsidering what I will study. My cousin has just been telling me\r\nthat I ought to do something."\r\n\r\n"So you ought," said Iphigenia energetically from her writing-desk.\r\n\r\n"But he didn\'t seem to have any clear opinion what it ought to be.\r\nYou see there can\'t be two Chancellors of the Exchequer at the same\r\ntime. Mrs. Sparkes, what ought a young man like me to set about\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\n"Go into Parliament, I should say," said Mrs. Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; exactly. He had some notion of that kind, too, but he\r\ndidn\'t name any particular place. I think I\'ll try the City of\r\nLondon. They\'ve four there, and of course the chance of getting in\r\nwould thereby be doubled."\r\n\r\n"I thought that commercial men were generally preferred in the City,"\r\nsaid the Duchess, taking a strong and good-natured interest in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser means to make a fortune in trade as a preliminary," said\r\nMrs. Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he meant anything of the kind," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"At any rate I have got to do something, so I can\'t go and ride,"\r\nsaid Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n"And you ought to do something," said Iphigenia from her desk.\r\n\r\nTwice during this little conversation Lady Glencora had looked up,\r\ncatching Alice\'s eye, and Alice had well known what she had meant.\r\n"You see," the glance had said, "Plantagenet is beginning to take an\r\ninterest in his cousin, and you know why. The man who is to be the\r\nfather of the future dukes must not be allowed to fritter away his\r\ntime in obscurity. Had I that cradle up-stairs Jeffrey might be as\r\nidle as he pleased." Alice understood it well.\r\n\r\nOf course Jeffrey did join the riding party. "What is a man like me\r\nto do who wants to do something?" he said to Alice. Alice was quite\r\naware that Lady Glencora had contrived some little scheme that Mr.\r\nPalliser should be riding next to her. She liked Mr. Palliser, and\r\ntherefore had no objection; but she declared to herself that her\r\ncousin was a goose for her pains.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Sparkes says you ought to go into Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and the dear Duchess would perhaps suggest a house in Belgrave\r\nSquare. I want to hear your advice now."\r\n\r\n"I can only say ditto to Miss Palliser."\r\n\r\n"What! Iphy? About procrastination? But you see the more of my time\r\nhe steals the better it is for me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the evil you have got to cure."\r\n\r\n"My cousin Plantagenet suggested--marriage."\r\n\r\n"A very good thing too, I\'m sure," said Alice; "only it depends\r\nsomething on the sort of wife you get."\r\n\r\n"You mean, of course, how much money she has."\r\n\r\n"Not altogether."\r\n\r\n"Looking at it from my cousin\'s point of view, I suppose that it is\r\nthe only important point. Who are there coming up this year,--in the\r\nway of heiresses?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know. In the first place, how much money makes\r\nan heiress?"\r\n\r\n"For such a fellow as me, I suppose ten thousand pounds ought to do."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not much," said Alice, who had exactly that amount of her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"No--; perhaps that\'s too moderate. But the lower one went in the\r\nmoney speculation, the greater would be the number to choose from,\r\nand the better the chance of getting something decent in the woman\r\nherself. I have something of my own,--not much you know; so with\r\nthe lady\'s ten thousand pounds we might be able to live,--in some\r\nsecond-rate French town perhaps."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see what you would gain by that."\r\n\r\n"My people here would have got rid of me. That seems to be the great\r\nthing. If you hear of any girl with about that sum, moderately\r\ngood-looking, not too young so that she might know something of the\r\nworld, decently born, and able to read and write, perhaps you will\r\nbear me in mind."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Alice, who was quite aware that he had made an\r\naccurate picture of her own position. "When I meet such a one, I will\r\nsend for you at once."\r\n\r\n"You know no such person now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; not just at present."\r\n\r\n"I declare I don\'t think he could do anything better," her cousin\r\nsaid to her that night. Lady Glencora was now in the habit of having\r\nAlice with her in what she called her dressing-room every evening,\r\nand then they would sit till the small hours came upon them. Mr.\r\nPalliser always burnt the midnight oil and came to bed with the owls.\r\nThey would often talk of him and his prospects till Alice had perhaps\r\ninspired his wife with more of interest in him and them than she had\r\nbefore felt. And Alice had managed generally to drive her friend away\r\nfrom those topics which were so dangerous,--those allusions to her\r\nchildlessness, and those hints that Burgo Fitzgerald was still in her\r\nthoughts. And sometimes, of course, they had spoken of Alice\'s own\r\nprospects, till she got into a way of telling her cousin freely all\r\nthat she felt. On such occasions Lady Glencora would always tell her\r\nthat she had been right,--if she did not love the man. "Though your\r\nfinger were put out for the ring," said Lady Glencora on one such\r\noccasion, "you should go back, if you did not love him."\r\n\r\n"But I did love him," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t understand it," said Lady Glencora; and, in truth,\r\nclose as was their intimacy, they did not perfectly understand each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion they were speaking of Jeffrey Palliser. "I\r\ndeclare I don\'t think he could do any better," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"If you talk such nonsense, I will not stay," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But why should it be nonsense? You would be very comfortable with\r\nyour joint incomes. He is one of the best fellows in the world. It is\r\nclear that he likes you; and then we should be so near to each other.\r\nI am sure Mr. Palliser would do something for him if he married,--and\r\nespecially if I asked him."\r\n\r\n"I only know of two things against it."\r\n\r\n"And what are they?"\r\n\r\n"That he would not take me for his wife, and that I would not take\r\nhim for my husband."\r\n\r\n"Why not? What do you dislike in him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t dislike him at all. I like him very much indeed. But one\r\ncan\'t marry all the people one likes."\r\n\r\n"But what reason is there why you shouldn\'t marry him?"\r\n\r\n"This chiefly," said Alice, after a pause; "that I have just\r\nseparated myself from a man whom I certainly did love truly, and\r\nthat I cannot transfer my affections quite so quickly as that."\r\n\r\nAs soon as the words were out of her mouth she knew that they should\r\nnot have been spoken. It was exactly what Glencora had done. She\r\nhad loved a man and had separated herself from him and had married\r\nanother all within a month or two. Lady Glencora first became red as\r\nfire over her whole face and shoulders, and Alice afterwards did the\r\nsame as she looked up, as though searching in her cousin\'s eyes for\r\npardon.\r\n\r\n"It is an unmaidenly thing to do, certainly," said Lady Glencora very\r\nslowly, and in her lowest voice. "Nay, it is unwomanly; but one may\r\nbe driven. One may be so driven that all gentleness of womanhood is\r\ndriven out of one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"I did not propose that you should do it as a sudden thing."\r\n\r\n"Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"I did do it suddenly. I know it. I did it like a beast that is\r\ndriven as its owner chooses. I know it. I was a beast. Oh, Alice, if\r\nyou know how I hate myself!"\r\n\r\n"But I love you with all my heart," said Alice. "Glencora, I have\r\nlearned to love you so dearly!"\r\n\r\n"Then you are the only being that does. He can\'t love me. How is it\r\npossible? You,--and perhaps another."\r\n\r\n"There are many who love you. He loves you. Mr. Palliser loves you."\r\n\r\n"It is impossible. I have never said a word to him that could make\r\nhim love me. I have never done a thing for him that can make him love\r\nme. The mother of his child he might have loved, because of that. Why\r\nshould he love me? We were told to marry each other and did it. When\r\ncould he have learned to love me? But, Alice, he requires no loving,\r\neither to take it or to give it. I wish it were so with me."\r\n\r\nAlice said what she could to comfort her, but her words were but of\r\nlittle avail as regarded those marriage sorrows.\r\n\r\n"Forgive you!" at last Glencora said. "What have I to forgive? You\r\ndon\'t suppose I do not know it all, and think of it all without the\r\nchance of some stray word like that! Forgive you! I am so grateful\r\nthat you love me! Some one\'s love I must have found,--or I could not\r\nhave remained here."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLady Midlothian.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week or ten days after this, Alice, when she came down to the\r\nbreakfast-parlour one morning, found herself alone with Mr. Bott. It\r\nwas the fashion at Matching Priory for people to assemble rather late\r\nin the day. The nominal hour for breakfast was ten, and none of the\r\nladies of the party were ever seen before that. Some of the gentlemen\r\nwould breakfast earlier, especially on hunting mornings; and on some\r\noccasions the ladies, when they came together, would find themselves\r\naltogether deserted by their husbands and brothers. On this day it\r\nwas fated that Mr. Bott alone should represent the sterner sex, and\r\nwhen Alice entered the room he was standing on the rug with his\r\nback to the fire, waiting till the appearance of some other guest\r\nshould give him the sanction necessary for the commencement of his\r\nmorning meal. Alice, when she saw him, would have retreated had it\r\nbeen possible, for she had learned to dislike him greatly, and was,\r\nindeed, almost afraid of him; but she could not do so without making\r\nher flight too conspicuous.\r\n\r\n"Do you intend to prolong your stay here, Miss Vavasor?" said Mr.\r\nBott, taking advantage of the first moment at which she looked up\r\nfrom a letter which she was reading.\r\n\r\n"For a few more days, I think," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ah--I\'m glad of that. Mr. Palliser has pressed me so much to remain\r\ntill he goes to the Duke\'s, that I cannot get away sooner. As I am an\r\nunmarried man myself, I can employ my time as well in one place as in\r\nanother;--at this time of the year at least."\r\n\r\n"You must find that very convenient," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is convenient. You see in my position,--Parliamentary\r\nposition, I mean,--I am obliged, as a public man, to act in concert\r\nwith others. A public man can be of no service unless he is prepared\r\nto do that. We must give and take, you know, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\nAs Miss Vavasor made no remark in answer to this, Mr. Bott\r\ncontinued--"I always say to the men of my party,--of course I regard\r\nmyself as belonging to the extreme Radicals."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I came into Parliament on that understanding; and I have never\r\nseen any occasion as yet to change any political opinion that I have\r\nexpressed. But I always say to the gentlemen with whom I act, that\r\nnothing can be done if we don\'t give and take. I don\'t mind saying to\r\nyou, Miss Vavasor, that I look upon our friend, Mr. Palliser, as the\r\nmost rising public man in the country. I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"I am happy to hear you say so," said his victim, who found herself\r\ndriven to make some remark.\r\n\r\n"And I, as an extreme Radical, do not think I can serve my party\r\nbetter than by keeping in the same boat with him, as long as it will\r\nhold the two. \'He\'ll make a Government hack of you,\' a friend of mine\r\nsaid to me the other day. \'And I\'ll make a Manchester school Prime\r\nMinister of him,\' I replied. I rather think I know what I\'m about,\r\nMiss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"And so does he;--and so does he. Mr. Palliser is not the man to be\r\nled by the nose by any one. But it\'s a fair system of give and take.\r\nYou can\'t get on in politics without it. What a charming woman is\r\nyour relative, Lady Glencowrer! I remember well what you said to me\r\nthe other evening."\r\n\r\n"Do you?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"And I quite agree with you that confidential intercourse regarding\r\ndear friends should not be lightly made."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But there are occasions, Miss Vavasor; there are occasions when the\r\nordinary laws by which we govern our social conduct must be made\r\nsomewhat elastic."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think this one of them, Mr. Bott."\r\n\r\n"Is it not? Just listen to me for one moment, Miss Vavasor. Our\r\nfriend, Mr. Palliser, I am proud to say, relies much upon my humble\r\nfriendship. Our first connection has, of course, been political; but\r\nit has extended beyond that, and has become pleasantly social;--I may\r\nsay, very pleasantly social."\r\n\r\n"What a taste Mr. Palliser must have!" Alice thought to herself.\r\n\r\n"But I need not tell you that Lady Glencowrer is--very young; we may\r\nsay, very young indeed."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott, I will not talk to you about Lady Glencora Palliser."\r\n\r\nThis Alice said in a determined voice, and with all the power of\r\nresistance at her command. She frowned too, and looked savagely at Mr.\r\nBott. But he was a man of considerable courage, and knew how to bear\r\nsuch opposition without flinching.\r\n\r\n"When I tell you, Miss Vavasor, that I speak solely with a view to\r\nher domestic happiness!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that she wishes to have any such guardian of her\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"But if he wishes it, Miss Vavasor! Now I have the means of knowing\r\nthat he has the greatest reliance on your judgement."\r\n\r\nHereupon Alice got up with the intention of leaving the room, but she\r\nwas met at the door by Mrs. Conway Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"Are you running from your breakfast, Miss Vavasor?" said she.\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs. Sparkes; I am running from Mr. Bott," said Alice, who was\r\nalmost beside herself with anger.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott, what is this?" said Mrs. Sparkes. "Ha, ha, ha," laughed Mr.\r\nBott.\r\n\r\nAlice returned to the room, and Mrs. Sparkes immediately saw that\r\nshe had in truth been running from Mr. Bott. "I hope I shall be able\r\nto keep the peace," said she. "I trust his offence was not one that\r\nrequires special punishment."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha," again laughed Mr. Bott, who rather liked his position.\r\n\r\nAlice was very angry with herself, feeling that she had told more of\r\nthe truth to Mrs. Sparkes than she should have done, unless she was\r\nprepared to tell the whole. As it was, she wanted to say something,\r\nand did not know what to say; but her confusion was at once stopped\r\nby the entrance of Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Sparkes, good morning," said Lady Glencora. "I hope nobody has\r\nwaited breakfast. Good morning, Mr. Bott. Oh, Alice!"\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said Alice, going up to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Alice, such a blow!" But Alice could see that her cousin was\r\nnot quite in earnest;--that the new trouble, though it might be\r\nvexatious, was no great calamity. "Come here," said Lady Glencora;\r\nand they both went into an embrasure of the window. "Now I shall have\r\nto put your confidence in me to the test. This letter is from,--whom\r\ndo you think?"\r\n\r\n"How can I guess?"\r\n\r\n"From Lady Midlothian! and she\'s coming here on Monday, on her road\r\nto London. Unless you tell me that you are quite sure this is as\r\nunexpected by me as by you, I will never speak to you again."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then we can consult. But first we\'ll go and have some\r\nbreakfast." Then more ladies swarmed into the room,--the Duchess and\r\nher daughter, and the two Miss Pallisers, and others; and Mr. Bott\r\nhad his hands full in attending,--or rather in offering to attend, to\r\ntheir little wants.\r\n\r\nThe morning was nearly gone before Alice and her cousin had any\r\nfurther opportunity of discussing in private the approach of Lady\r\nMidlothian; but Mr. Palliser had come in among them, and had been told\r\nof the good thing which was in store for him. "We shall be delighted\r\nto see Lady Midlothian," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"But there is somebody here who will not be at all delighted to see\r\nher," said Lady Glencora to her husband.\r\n\r\n"Is there, indeed?" said he. "Who is that?"\r\n\r\n"Her most undutiful cousin, Alice Vavasor. But, Alice, Mr. Palliser\r\nknows nothing about it, and it is too long to explain."\r\n\r\n"I am extremely sorry--" began Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I can assure you it does not signify in the least," said Alice. "It\r\nwill only be taking me away three days earlier."\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this Mr. Palliser looked very serious. What quarrel could\r\nMiss Vavasor have had with Lady Midlothian which should make it\r\nimpossible for them to be visitors at the same house?\r\n\r\n"It will do no such thing," said Lady Glencora. "Do you mean to say\r\nthat you are coward enough to run away from her?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, Miss Vavasor, that we can hardly bid her not come," said\r\nMr. Palliser. In answer to this, Alice protested that she would not\r\nfor worlds have been the means of keeping Lady Midlothian away from\r\nMatching. "I should tell you, Mr. Palliser, that I have never seen\r\nLady Midlothian, though she is my far-away cousin. Nor have I ever\r\nquarrelled with her. But she has given me advice by letter, and I did\r\nnot answer her because I thought she had no business to interfere.\r\nI shall go away, not because I am afraid of her, but because, after\r\nwhat has passed, our meeting would be unpleasant to her."\r\n\r\n"You could tell her that Miss Vavasor is here," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n"And then she need not come unless she pleased."\r\n\r\nThe matter was so managed at last that Alice found herself unable\r\nto leave Matching without making more of Lady Midlothian\'s coming\r\nthan it was worth. It would undoubtedly be very disagreeable,--this\r\nunexpected meeting with her relative; but, as Lady Glencora said,\r\nLady Midlothian would not eat her. In truth, she felt ashamed of\r\nherself in that she was afraid of her relative. No doubt she was\r\nafraid of her. So much she was forced to admit to herself. But she\r\nresolved at last that she would not let her drive her out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Bott an admirer of your cousin?" Mrs. Sparkes said that evening\r\nto Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"A very distant one I should think," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Goodness gracious!" exclaimed an old lady who had been rather awed\r\nby Alice\'s intimacy and cousinship with Lady Glencora; "it\'s the very\r\nlast thing I should have dreamt of."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t dream it, first or last," said Mrs. Sparkes.\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t suppose that I am asking whether Miss Vavasor is an admirer\r\nof his," said Mrs. Sparkes. "I have no suspicion of that nature. I\r\nrather think that when he plays Bacchus she plays Ariadne, with full\r\nintention of flying from him in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Bott inclined to play Bacchus?" asked Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I rather thought he was this morning. If you observe, he has\r\nsomething of a godlike and triumphant air about him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think his godship will triumph there," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I really think she would be throwing herself very much away," said\r\nthe old lady.\r\n\r\n"Miss Vavasor is not at all disposed to do that," said Mrs. Sparkes.\r\nThen that conversation was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, Lady Midlothian arrived. The carriage was\r\nsent to meet her at the station about three o\'clock in the afternoon,\r\nand Alice had to choose whether she would undergo her first\r\nintroduction immediately on her relative\'s arrival, or whether she\r\nwould keep herself out of the way till she should meet her in the\r\ndrawing-room before dinner.\r\n\r\n"I shall receive her when she comes," said Lady Glencora, "and of\r\ncourse will tell her that you are here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that will be best; and--; dear me, I declare I don\'t know how\r\nto manage it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bring her to you in my room if you like it."\r\n\r\n"No; that would be too solemn," said Alice. "That would make her\r\nunderstand that I thought a great deal about her."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll let things take their chance, and you shall come across\r\nher just as you would any other stranger." It was settled at last\r\nthat this would be the better course, but that Lady Midlothian was to\r\nbe informed of Alice\'s presence at the Priory as soon as she should\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nAlice was in her own room when the carriage in which sat the\r\nunwelcome old lady was driven up to the hall-door. She heard the\r\nwheels plainly, and knew well that her enemy was within the house.\r\nShe had striven hard all the morning to make herself feel indifferent\r\nto this arrival, but had not succeeded; and was angry with herself\r\nat finding that she sat up-stairs with an anxious heart, because\r\nshe knew that her cousin was in the room down-stairs. What was Lady\r\nMidlothian to her that she should be afraid of her? And yet she was\r\nvery much afraid of Lady Midlothian. She questioned herself on the\r\nsubject over and over again, and found herself bound to admit that\r\nsuch was the fact. At last, about five o\'clock, having reasoned much\r\nwith herself, and rebuked herself for her own timidity, she descended\r\ninto the drawing-room,--Lady Glencora having promised that she would\r\nat that hour be there,--and on opening the door became immediately\r\nconscious that she was in the presence of her august relative. There\r\nsat Lady Midlothian in a great chair opposite the fire, and Lady\r\nGlencora sat near to her on a stool. One of the Miss Pallisers was\r\nreading in a further part of the room, and there was no one else\r\npresent in the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Midlothian was a very little woman, between sixty and\r\nseventy years of age, who must have been very pretty in her youth.\r\nAt present she made no pretension either to youth or beauty,--as\r\nsome ladies above sixty will still do,--but sat confessedly an old\r\nwoman in all her external relations. She wore a round bonnet which\r\ncame much over her face,--being accustomed to continue the use\r\nof her bonnet till dinner time when once she had been forced by\r\ncircumstances to put it on. She wore a short cloak which fitted\r\nclose to her person, and, though she occupied a great arm-chair,\r\nsat perfectly upright, looking at the fire. Very small she was, but\r\nshe carried in her grey eyes and sharp-cut features a certain look\r\nof importance which saved her from being considered as small in\r\nimportance. Alice, as soon as she saw her, knew that she was a lady\r\nover whom no easy victory could be obtained.\r\n\r\n"Here is Alice," said Lady Glencora, rising as her cousin entered the\r\nroom. "Alice, let me introduce you to Lady Midlothian."\r\n\r\nAlice, as she came forward, was able to assume an easy demeanour,\r\neven though her heart within was failing her. She put out her hand,\r\nleaving it to the elder lady to speak the first words of greeting.\r\n\r\n"I am glad at last to be able to make your acquaintance, my dear,"\r\nsaid Lady Midlothian; "very glad." But still Alice did not speak.\r\n"Your aunt, Lady Macleod, is one of my oldest friends, and I have\r\nheard her speak of you very often."\r\n\r\n"And Lady Macleod has often spoken to me of your ladyship," said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n"Then we know each other\'s names," said the Countess; "and it will\r\nbe well that we should be acquainted with each other\'s persons. I am\r\nbecoming an old woman, and if I did not learn to know you now, or\r\nvery shortly, I might never do so."\r\n\r\nAlice could not help thinking that even under those circumstances\r\nneither might have had, so far as that was concerned, much cause of\r\nsorrow, but she did not say so. She was thinking altogether of Lady\r\nMidlothian\'s letter to her, and trying to calculate whether or no\r\nit would be well for her to rush away at once to the subject. That\r\nLady Midlothian would mention the letter, Alice felt well assured;\r\nand when could it be better mentioned than now, in Glencora\'s\r\npresence,--when no other person was near them to listen to her? "You\r\nare very kind," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I would wish to be so," said Lady Midlothian. "Blood is thicker\r\nthan water, my dear; and I know no earthly ties that can bind people\r\ntogether if those of family connection will not do so. Your mother,\r\nwhen she and I were young, was my dearest friend."\r\n\r\n"I never knew my mother," said Alice,--feeling, however, as she\r\nspoke, that the strength of her resistance to the old woman was\r\nbeginning to give way.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, you never did; and that is to my thinking another\r\nreason why they who loved her should love you. But Lady Macleod is\r\nyour nearest relative,--on your mother\'s side, I mean,--and she has\r\ndone her duty by you well."\r\n\r\n"Indeed she has, Lady Midlothian."\r\n\r\n"She has, and others, therefore, have been the less called upon to\r\ninterfere. I only say this, my dear, in my own vindication,--feeling,\r\nperhaps, that my conduct needs some excuse."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Alice does not think that," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"It is what I think rather than what Alice thinks that concerns my\r\nown shortcomings," said Lady Midlothian, with a smile which was\r\nintended to be pleasant. "But I have wished to make up for former\r\nlost opportunities." Alice knew that she was about to refer to her\r\nletter, and trembled. "I am very anxious now to be reckoned one of\r\nAlice Vavasor\'s friends, if she will allow me to become so."\r\n\r\n"I can only be too proud,--if--"\r\n\r\n"If what, my dear?" said the old lady. I believe that she meant to be\r\ngracious, but there was something in her manner, or, perhaps, rather\r\nin her voice, so repellant, that Alice felt that they could hardly\r\nbecome true friends. "If what, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Alice means--" began Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Let Alice say what she means herself," said Lady Midlothian.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to say what I do mean," said Alice, whose spirit\r\nwithin her was rising higher as the occasion for using it came upon\r\nher. "I am assured that you and I, Lady Midlothian, differ very much\r\nas to a certain matter; and as it is one in which I must be guided by\r\nmy own opinion, and not that of any other person, perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"You mean about Mr. Grey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Alice; "I mean about Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"I think so much about that matter, and your happiness as therein\r\nconcerned, that when I heard that you were here I was determined\r\nto take Matching in my way to London, so that I might have an\r\nopportunity of speaking to you."\r\n\r\n"Then you knew that Alice was here," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did. I suppose you have heard all the history,\r\nGlencora?"\r\n\r\nLady Glencora was forced to acknowledge that she had heard the\r\nhistory,--"the history" being poor Alice\'s treatment of Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of it?" Both Alice and her hostess looked\r\nround to the further end of the room in which Miss Palliser was\r\nreading, intending thus to indicate that the lady knew as yet none\r\nof the circumstances, and that there could be no good reason why she\r\nshould be instructed in them at this moment. "Perhaps another time\r\nand another place may be better," said Lady Midlothian; "but I must\r\ngo the day after to-morrow,--indeed, I thought of going to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Midlothian!" exclaimed Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"You must regard this as merely a passing visit, made upon business.\r\nBut, as I was saying, when shall I get an opportunity of speaking to\r\nAlice where we need not be interrupted?"\r\n\r\nLady Glencora suggested her room up-stairs, and offered the use of it\r\nthen, or on that night when the world should be about to go to bed.\r\nBut the idea of this premeditated lecture was terrible to Alice, and\r\nshe determined that she would not endure it.\r\n\r\n"Lady Midlothian, it would really be of no use."\r\n\r\n"Of no use, my dear!"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I did get your letter, you know."\r\n\r\n"And as you have not answered it, I have come all this way to see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I shall be so sorry if I give offence, but it is a subject which\r\nI cannot bring myself to discuss"--she was going to say with a\r\nstranger, but she was able to check herself before the offensive word\r\nwas uttered,--"which I cannot bring myself to discuss with any one."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say that you won\'t see me?"\r\n\r\n"I will not talk upon that matter," said Alice. "I will not do it\r\neven with Lady Macleod."\r\n\r\n"No," said Lady Midlothian, and her sharp grey eyes now began to\r\nkindle with anger; "and therefore it is so very necessary that other\r\nfriends should interfere."\r\n\r\n"But I will endure no interference," said Alice, "either from persons\r\nwho are friends or who are not friends." And as she spoke she rose\r\nfrom her chair. "You must forgive me, Lady Midlothian, if I say that\r\nI can have no conversation with you on this matter." Then she walked\r\nout of the room, leaving the Countess and Lady Glencora together. As\r\nshe went Miss Palliser lifted her eyes from her book, and knew that\r\nthere had been a quarrel, but I doubt if she had heard any of the\r\nwords which had been spoken.\r\n\r\n"The most self-willed young woman I ever met in my life," said Lady\r\nMidlothian, as soon as Alice was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The most self-willed young woman I ever met in\r\nmy life."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I knew very well how it would be," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"But it is quite frightful, my dear. She has been engaged, with the\r\nconsent of all her friends, to this young man."\r\n\r\n"I know all about it."\r\n\r\n"But you must think she is very wrong."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand her, but I suppose she fears they would not\r\nbe happy together."\r\n\r\n"Understand her! I should think not; nobody can understand her. A\r\nyoung woman to become engaged to a gentleman in that way,--before all\r\nthe world, as one may say;--to go to his house, as I am told, and\r\ntalk to the servants, and give orders about the furniture and then\r\nturn round and simply say that she has changed her mind! She hasn\'t\r\ngiven the slightest reason to my knowledge." And Lady Midlothian, as\r\nshe insisted on the absolute iniquity of Alice\'s proceedings, almost\r\nstartled Lady Glencora by the eagerness of her countenance. Lady\r\nMidlothian had been one of those who, even now not quite two years\r\nago, had assisted in obtaining the submission of Lady Glencora\r\nherself. Lady Midlothian seemed on the present occasion to remember\r\nnothing of this, but Lady Glencora remembered it very exactly.\r\n"I shall not give it up," continued Lady Midlothian. "I have the\r\ngreatest possible objection to her father, who contrived to connect\r\nhimself with our family in a most shameful manner, without the\r\nslightest encouragement. I don\'t think I have spoken to him since,\r\nbut I shall see him now and tell him my opinion."\r\n\r\nAlice held her ground, and avoided all further conversation with Lady\r\nMidlothian. A message came to her through Lady Glencora imploring her\r\nto give way, but she was quite firm.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye to you," Lady Midlothian said to her as she went. "Even yet\r\nI hope that things may go right, and if so you will find that I can\r\nforget and forgive."\r\n\r\n"If perseverance merits success," said Lady Glencora to Alice, "she\r\nought to succeed." "But she won\'t succeed," said Alice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Priory Ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Midlothian went away on her road to London on the Wednesday\r\nmorning, and Alice was to follow her on the next day. It was now\r\nDecember, and the weather was very clear and frosty, but at night\r\nthere was bright moonlight. On this special night the moon would be\r\nfull, and Lady Glencora had declared that she and Alice would go out\r\namidst the ruins. It was no secret engagement, having been canvassed\r\nin public, and having been met with considerable discouragement\r\nby some of the party. Mr. Palliser had remarked that the night air\r\nwould be very cold, and Mr. Bott had suggested all manner of evil\r\nconsequences. Had Mr. Palliser alone objected, Lady Glencora might\r\nhave given way, but Mr. Bott\'s word riveted her purpose.\r\n\r\n"We are not going to be frightened," Lady Glencora said.\r\n\r\n"People do not generally walk out at night in December," Mr. Palliser\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the reason why we want to do it," said Lady Glencora.\r\n"But we shall wrap ourselves up, and nobody need be afraid. Jeffrey,\r\nwe shall expect you to stand sentinel at the old gate, and guard us\r\nfrom the ghosts."\r\n\r\nJeffrey Palliser, bargaining that he might be allowed a cigar,\r\npromised that he would do as he was bidden.\r\n\r\nThe party at Matching Priory had by this time become very small.\r\nThere were indeed no guests left, not counting those of the Palliser\r\nfamily, excepting Miss Vavasor, Mr. Bott, and an old lady who had\r\nbeen a great friend of Mr. Palliser\'s mother. It was past ten in the\r\nevening when Lady Glencora declared that the time had arrived for\r\nthem to carry out their purpose. She invited the two Miss Pallisers\r\nto join her, but they declined, urging their fear of the night air,\r\nand showing by their manner that they thought the proposition a very\r\nimprudent one. Mr. Bott offered to accompany them, but Lady Glencora\r\ndeclined his attendance very stoutly.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Mr. Bott; you were one of those who preached a sermon\r\nagainst my dissipation in the morning, and I\'m not going to allow you\r\nto join it, now the time for its enjoyment has come."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Glencora, if I were you, indeed I wouldn\'t," said the\r\nold lady, looking round towards Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Marsham, if you were me, indeed you would," and Lady\r\nGlencora also looked at her husband.\r\n\r\n"I think it a foolish thing to do," said Mr. Palliser, sternly.\r\n\r\n"If you forbid it, of course we won\'t go," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Forbid it:--no; I shall not forbid it."\r\n\r\n"Allons donc," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nShe and Alice were already muffled in cloaks and thick shawls, and\r\nAlice now followed her out of the room. There was a door which opened\r\nfrom the billiard-room out on to the grand terrace, which ran in\r\nfront of the house, and here they found Jeffrey Palliser already\r\narmed with his cigar. Alice, to tell the truth, would much have\r\npreferred to abandon the expedition, but she had felt that it would\r\nbe cowardly in her to desert Lady Glencora. There had not arisen any\r\nvery close intimacy between her and Mr. Palliser, but she entertained\r\na certain feeling that Mr. Palliser trusted her, and liked her to\r\nbe with his wife. She would have wished to justify this supposed\r\nconfidence, and was almost sure that Mr. Palliser expected her to\r\ndo so in this instance. She did say a word or two to her cousin\r\nup-stairs, urging that perhaps her husband would not like it.\r\n\r\n"Let him say so plainly," said Lady Glencora, "and I\'ll give it\r\nup instantly. But I\'m not going to be lectured out of my purposes\r\nsecondhand by Mr. Bott or old Mother Marsham. I understand all these\r\npeople, my dear. And if you throw me over, Alice, I\'ll never forgive\r\nyou," Lady Glencora added.\r\n\r\nAfter this Alice resolved that she would not throw her friend over.\r\nShe was afraid to do so. But she was also becoming a little afraid of\r\nher friend,--afraid that she would be driven some day either to throw\r\nher over, or to say words to her that would be very unpalatable.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jeffrey," said Lady Glencora as they walked abreast along the\r\nbroad terrace towards the ruins, "when we get under the old gateway\r\nyou must let me and Alice go round the dormitory and the chapel\r\nalone. Then we\'ll come back by the cloisters, and we\'ll take another\r\nturn outside with you. The outside is the finest by this light,--only\r\nI want to show Alice something by ourselves."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not afraid, I know, and if Miss Vavasor is not--"\r\n\r\n"Miss Vavasor,--who, I think, would have allowed you to call her by\r\nher other name on such an occasion as this,--is never afraid."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, how dare you say so?" said Alice. "I really think we had\r\nbetter go back."\r\n\r\nShe felt herself to be very angry with her cousin. She almost\r\nbegan to fear that she had mistaken her, and had thought better of\r\nher than she had deserved. What she had now said struck Alice as\r\nbeing vulgar,--as being premeditated vulgarity, and her annoyance\r\nwas excessive. Of course Mr. Palliser would think that she was a\r\nconsenting party to the proposition made to him.\r\n\r\n"Go back!" said Glencora. "No, indeed. We\'ll go on, and leave him\r\nhere. Then he can call nobody anything. Don\'t be angry with me," she\r\nsaid, as soon as they were out of hearing. "The truth is this;--if\r\nyou choose to have him for your husband, you may."\r\n\r\n"But if I do not choose."\r\n\r\n"Then there can be no harm done, and I will tell him so. But,\r\nAlice,--think of this. Whom will you meet that would suit you better?\r\nAnd you need not decide now. You need not say a word, but leave me to\r\ntell him, that if it is to be thought of at all, it cannot be thought\r\nof till he meets you in London. Trust me, you will be safe with me."\r\n\r\n"You shall tell him nothing of the kind," said Alice. "I believe you\r\nto be joking throughout, and I think the joke is a bad one."\r\n\r\n"No; there you wrong me. Indeed I am not joking. I know that in what\r\nI am saying I am telling you the simple truth. He has said enough\r\nto me to justify me in saying so. Alice, think of it all. It would\r\nreconcile me to much, and it would be something to be the mother of\r\nthe future Duke of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"To me it would be nothing," said Alice; "less than nothing. I mean\r\nto say that the temptation is one so easily resisted that it acts in\r\nthe other way. Don\'t say anything more about it, Glencora."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t wish it, I will not."\r\n\r\n"No;--I do not wish it. I don\'t think I ever saw moonlight so bright\r\nas this. Look at the lines of that window against the light. They are\r\nclearer than you ever see them in the day."\r\n\r\nThey were now standing just within the gateway of the old cruciform\r\nchapel, having entered the transept from a ruined passage which was\r\nsupposed to have connected the church with the dormitory. The church\r\nwas altogether roofless, but the entire walls were standing. The\r\nsmall clerestory windows of the nave were perfect, and the large\r\nwindows of the two transepts and of the west end were nearly so. Of\r\nthe opposite window, which had formed the back of the choir, very\r\nlittle remained. The top of it, with all its tracery, was gone, and\r\nthree broken upright mullions of uneven heights alone remained. This\r\nwas all that remained of the old window, but a transom or cross-bar\r\nof stone had been added to protect the carved stone-work of the\r\nsides, and save the form of the aperture from further ruin. That this\r\ntransom was modern was to be seen from the magnificent height and\r\nlight grace of the workmanship in the other windows, in which the\r\nlong slender mullions rose from the lower stage or foundation of the\r\nwhole up into the middle tracery of the arch without protection or\r\nsupport, and then lost themselves among the curves, not running up\r\ninto the roof or soffit, and there holding on as though unable to\r\nstand alone. Such weakness as that had not as yet shown itself in\r\nEnglish church architecture when Matching Priory was built.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Priory Ruins.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Is it not beautiful!" said Glencora. "I do love it so! And there is\r\na peculiar feeling of cold about the chill of the moon, different\r\nfrom any other cold. It makes you wrap yourself up tight, but it does\r\nnot make your teeth chatter; and it seems to go into your senses\r\nrather than into your bones. But I suppose that\'s nonsense," she\r\nadded, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Not more so than what people are supposed to talk by moonlight."\r\n\r\n"That\'s unkind. I\'d like what I say on such an occasion to be more\r\npoetical or else more nonsensical than what other people say under\r\nthe same circumstances. And now I\'ll tell you why I always think of\r\nyou when I come here by moonlight."\r\n\r\n"But I suppose you don\'t often come."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; that is to say, I did come very often when we had the\r\nfull moon in August. The weather wasn\'t like this, and I used to run\r\nout through the open windows and nobody knew where I was gone. I made\r\nhim come once, but he didn\'t seem to care about it. I told him that\r\npart of the refectory wall was falling; so he looked at that, and\r\nhad a mason sent the next day. If anything is out of order he has\r\nit put to rights at once. There would have been no ruins if all the\r\nPallisers had been like him."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for the world."\r\n\r\n"No;--I say no. Things may live too long. But now I\'m going to tell\r\nyou. Do you remember that night I brought you home from the play to\r\nQueen Anne Street?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do,--very well."\r\n\r\nAlice had occasion to remember it, for it had been in the carriage on\r\nthat evening that she had positively refused to give any aid to her\r\ncousin in that matter relating to Burgo Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"And do you remember how the moon shone then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I do."\r\n\r\n"I know I do. As we came round the corner out of Cavendish Square he\r\nwas standing there,--and a friend of yours was standing with him."\r\n\r\n"What friend of mine?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that; it does not matter now."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean my cousin George?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do mean your cousin; and oh, Alice! dear Alice! I don\'t know\r\nwhy I should love you, for if you had not been hardhearted that\r\nnight,--stony cruel in your hard propriety, I should have gone with\r\nhim then, and all this icy coldness would have been prevented."\r\n\r\nShe was standing quite close to Alice, and as she spake she shook\r\nwith shivering and wrapped her furs closer and still closer about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"You are very cold," said Alice. "We had better go in."\r\n\r\n"No, I am not cold,--not in that way. I won\'t go in yet. Jeffrey will\r\ncome to us directly. Yes;--we should have escaped that night if you\r\nwould have allowed him to come into your house. Ah, well! we didn\'t,\r\nand there\'s an end of it."\r\n\r\n"But Glencora,--you cannot regret it."\r\n\r\n"Not regret it! Alice, where can your heart be? Or have you a heart?\r\nNot regret it! I would give everything I have in the world to have\r\nbeen true to him. They told me that he would spend my money. Though\r\nhe should have spent every farthing of it, I regret it; though he\r\nshould have made me a beggar, I regret it. They told me that he would\r\nill-use me, and desert me,--perhaps beat me. I do not believe it; but\r\neven though that should have been so, I regret it. It is better to\r\nhave a false husband than to be a false wife."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, do not speak like that. Do not try to make me think that\r\nanything could tempt you to be false to your vows."\r\n\r\n"Tempt me to be false! Why, child, it has been all false throughout.\r\nI never loved him. How can you talk in that way, when you know that\r\nI never loved him? They browbeat me and frightened me till I did as\r\nI was told;--and now;--what am I now?"\r\n\r\n"You are his honest wife. Glencora, listen to me." And Alice took\r\nhold of her arm.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, "no; I am not honest. By law I am his wife; but the\r\nlaws are liars! I am not his wife. I will not say the thing that I\r\nam. When I went to him at the altar, I knew that I did not love the\r\nman that was to be my husband. But him,--Burgo,--I love him with all\r\nmy heart and soul. I could stoop at his feet and clean his shoes for\r\nhim, and think it no disgrace!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cora, my friend, do not say such words as those! Remember what\r\nyou owe your husband and yourself, and come away."\r\n\r\n"I do know what I owe him, and I will pay it him. Alice, if I had a\r\nchild I think I would be true to him. Think! I know I would;--though\r\nI had no hour of happiness left to me in my life. But what now is the\r\nonly honest thing that I can do? Why, leave him;--so leave him that\r\nhe may have another wife and be the father of a child. What injury\r\nshall I do him by leaving him? He does not love me; you know yourself\r\nthat he does not love me."\r\n\r\n"I know that he does."\r\n\r\n"Alice, that is untrue. He does not; and you have seen clearly that\r\nit is so. It may be that he can love no woman. But another woman\r\nwould give him a son, and he would be happy. I tell you that every\r\nday and every night,--every hour of every day and of every night,--I\r\nam thinking of the man I love. I have nothing else to think of. I\r\nhave no occupation,--no friends,--no one to whom I care to say a\r\nword. But I am always talking to Burgo in my thoughts; and he listens\r\nto me. I dream that his arm is round me--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"Well!--Do you begrudge me that I should tell you the truth? You have\r\nsaid that you would be my friend, and you must bear the burden of my\r\nfriendship. And now,--this is what I want to tell you.--Immediately\r\nafter Christmas, we are to go to Monkshade, and he will be there.\r\nLady Monk is his aunt."\r\n\r\n"You must not go. No power should take you there."\r\n\r\n"That is easily said, child; but all the same I must go. I told Mr.\r\nPalliser that he would be there, and he said it did not signify.\r\nHe actually said that it did not signify. I wonder whether he\r\nunderstands what it is for people to love each other;--whether he has\r\never thought about it."\r\n\r\n"You must tell him plainly that you will not go."\r\n\r\n"I did. I told him plainly as words could tell him. \'Glencora,\' he\r\nsaid,--and you know the way he looks when he means to be lord and\r\nmaster, and put on the very husband indeed,--\'This is an annoyance\r\nwhich you must bear and overcome. It suits me that we should go to\r\nMonkshade, and it does not suit me that there should be any one whom\r\nyou are afraid to meet.\' Could I tell him that he would lose his wife\r\nif I did go? Could I threaten him that I would throw myself into\r\nBurgo\'s arms if that opportunity were given to me? You are very wise,\r\nand very prudent. What would you have had me say?"\r\n\r\n"I would have you now tell him everything, rather than go to that\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Alice, look here. I know what I am, and what I am like to become. I\r\nloathe myself, and I loathe the thing that I am thinking of. I could\r\nhave clung to the outside of a man\'s body, to his very trappings,\r\nand loved him ten times better than myself!--ay, even though he\r\nhad ill-treated me,--if I had been allowed to choose a husband for\r\nmyself. Burgo would have spent my money,--all that it would have been\r\npossible for me to give him. But there would have been something\r\nleft, and I think that by that time I could have won even him to care\r\nfor me. But with that man--! Alice you are very wise. What am I to\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\nAlice had no doubt as to what her cousin should do. She should be\r\ntrue to her marriage-vow, whether that vow when made were true or\r\nfalse. She should be true to it as far as truth would now carry her.\r\nAnd in order that she might be true, she should tell her husband as\r\nmuch as might be necessary to induce him to spare her the threatened\r\nvisit to Monkshade. All that she said to Lady Glencora, as they\r\nwalked slowly across the chapel. But Lady Glencora was more occupied\r\nwith her own thoughts than with her friend\'s advice. "Here\'s\r\nJeffrey!" she said. "What an unconscionable time we have kept him!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it," he said. "And I shouldn\'t have come to you now,\r\nonly that I thought I should find you both freezing into marble."\r\n\r\n"We are not such cold-blooded creatures as that,--are we, Alice?"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora. "And now we\'ll go round the outside; only we must\r\nnot stay long, or we shall frighten those two delicious old duennas,\r\nMrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott."\r\n\r\nThese last words were said as it were in a whisper to Alice; but they\r\nwere so whispered that there was no real attempt to keep them from\r\nthe ears of Mr. Jeffrey Palliser. Glencora, Alice thought, should not\r\nhave allowed the word duenna to have passed her lips in speaking to\r\nany one; but, above all, she should not have done so in the hearing\r\nof Mr. Palliser\'s cousin.\r\n\r\nThey walked all round the ruin, on a raised gravel-path which had\r\nbeen made there; and Alice, who could hardly bring herself to\r\nspeak,--so full was her mind of that which had just been said to\r\nher,--was surprised to find that Glencora could go on, in her usual\r\nlight humour, chatting as though there were no weight within her to\r\ndepress her spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nAlice Leaves the Priory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they came in at the billiard-room door, Mr. Palliser was there to\r\nmeet them. "You must be very cold," he said to Glencora, who entered\r\nfirst. "No, indeed," said Glencora;--but her teeth were chattering,\r\nand her whole appearance gave the lie to her words. "Jeffrey," said\r\nMr. Palliser, turning to his cousin, "I am angry with you. You, at\r\nleast, should have known better than to have allowed her to remain so\r\nlong." Then Mr. Palliser turned away, and walked his wife off, taking\r\nno notice whatsoever of Miss Vavasor.\r\n\r\nAlice felt the slight, and understood it all. He had told her plainly\r\nenough, though not in words, that he had trusted his wife with her,\r\nand that she had betrayed the trust. She might have brought Glencora\r\nin within five or six minutes, instead of allowing her to remain out\r\nthere in the freezing night air for nearly three-quarters of an hour.\r\nThat was the accusation which Mr. Palliser made against her, and he\r\nmade it with the utmost severity. He asked no question of her whether\r\nshe were cold. He spoke no word to her, nor did he even look at her.\r\nShe might get herself away to her bedroom as she pleased. Alice\r\nunderstood all this completely, and though she knew that she had not\r\ndeserved such severity, she was not inclined to resent it. There was\r\nso much in Mr. Palliser\'s position that was to be pitied, that Alice\r\ncould not find it in her heart to be angry with him.\r\n\r\n"He is provoked with us, now," said Jeffrey Palliser, standing with\r\nher for a moment in the billiard-room, as he handed her a candle.\r\n\r\n"He is afraid that she will have caught cold."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and he thinks it wrong that she should remain out at night so\r\nlong. You can easily understand, Miss Vavasor, that he has not much\r\nsympathy for romance."\r\n\r\n"I dare say he is right," said Alice, not exactly knowing what to\r\nsay, and not being able to forget what had been said about herself\r\nand Jeffrey Palliser when they first left the house. "Romance usually\r\nmeans nonsense, I believe."\r\n\r\n"That is not Glencora\'s doctrine."\r\n\r\n"No; but she is younger than I am. My feet are very cold, Mr.\r\nPalliser, and I think I will go up to my room."\r\n\r\n"Good night," said Jeffrey, offering her his hand. "I think it so\r\nhard that you should have incurred his displeasure."\r\n\r\n"It will not hurt me," said Alice, smiling.\r\n\r\n"No;--but he does not forget."\r\n\r\n"Even that will not hurt me. Good night, Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\n"As it is the last night, may I say good night, Alice? I shall be\r\naway to-morrow before you are up."\r\n\r\nHe still held her hand; but it had not been in his for half a minute,\r\nand she had thought nothing of that, nor did she draw it away even\r\nnow suddenly. "No," said she, "Glencora was very wrong there,--doing\r\nan injury without meaning it to both of us. There can be no possible\r\nreason why you should call me otherwise than is customary."\r\n\r\n"Can there never be a reason?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Palliser. Good night;--and if I am not to see you to-morrow\r\nmorning, good-bye."\r\n\r\n"You will certainly not see me to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye. Had it not been for this folly of Glencora\'s, our\r\nacquaintance would have been very pleasant."\r\n\r\n"To me it has been very pleasant. Good night."\r\n\r\nThen she left him, and went up alone to her own room. Whether or no\r\nother guests were still left in the drawing-room she did not know;\r\nbut she had seen that Mr. Palliser took his wife up-stairs, and\r\ntherefore she considered herself right in presuming that the party\r\nwas broken up for the night. Mr. Palliser,--Plantagenet Palliser,\r\naccording to all rules of courtesy should have said a word to her as\r\nhe went; but, as I have said before, Alice was disposed to overlook\r\nhis want of civility on this occasion. So she went up alone to her\r\nroom, and was very glad to find herself able to get close to a good\r\nfire. She was, in truth, very cold--cold to her bones, in spite of\r\nwhat Lady Glencora had said on behalf of the moonlight. They two had\r\nbeen standing all but still during the greater part of the time that\r\nthey had been talking, and Alice, as she sat herself down, found that\r\nher feet were numbed with the damp that had penetrated through her\r\nboots. Certainly Mr. Palliser had reason to be angry that his wife\r\nshould have remained out in the night air so long,--though perhaps\r\nnot with Alice.\r\n\r\nAnd then she began to think of what had been told her; and to try\r\nto think of what, under such circumstances, it behoved her to do.\r\nShe could not doubt that Lady Glencora had intended to declare that,\r\nif opportunity offered itself, she would leave her husband, and put\r\nherself under the protection of Mr. Fitzgerald; and Alice, moreover,\r\nhad become painfully conscious that the poor deluded unreasoning\r\ncreature had taught herself to think that she might excuse herself\r\nfor this sin to her own conscience by the fact that she was\r\nchildless, and that she might thus give to the man who had married\r\nher an opportunity of seeking another wife who might give him an\r\nheir. Alice well knew how insufficient such an excuse would be even\r\nto the wretched woman who had framed it for herself. But still\r\nit would operate,--manifestly had already operated, on her mind,\r\nteaching her to hope that good might come out of evil. Alice, who was\r\nperfectly clearsighted as regarded her cousin, however much impaired\r\nher vision might have been with reference to herself, saw nothing but\r\nabsolute ruin, ruin of the worst and most intolerable description,\r\nin the plan which Lady Glencora seemed to have formed. To her it was\r\nblack in the depths of hell; and she knew that to Glencora also it\r\nwas black. "I loathe myself," Glencora had said, "and the thing that\r\nI am thinking of."\r\n\r\nWhat was Alice to do under these circumstances? Mr. Palliser, she was\r\naware, had quarrelled with her; for in his silent way he had first\r\nshown that he had trusted her as his wife\'s friend; and then, on this\r\nevening, he had shown that he had ceased to trust her. But she cared\r\nlittle for this. If she told him that she wished to speak to him, he\r\nwould listen, let his opinion of her be what it might; and having\r\nlistened he would surely act in some way that would serve to save\r\nhis wife. What Mr. Palliser might think of herself, Alice cared but\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nBut then there came to her an idea that was in every respect\r\nfeminine,--that in such a matter she had no right to betray her\r\nfriend. When one woman tells the story of her love to another woman,\r\nthe confidant always feels that she will be a traitor if she reveals\r\nthe secret. Had Lady Glencora made Alice believe that she meditated\r\nmurder, or robbery, Alice would have had no difficulty in telling the\r\ntale, and thus preventing the crime. But now she hesitated, feeling\r\nthat she would disgrace herself by betraying her friend. And, after\r\nall, was it not more than probable that Glencora had no intention of\r\ncarrying out a threat the very thought of which must be terrible to\r\nherself?\r\n\r\nAs she was thinking of all this, sitting in her dressing-gown close\r\nover the fire, there came a loud knock at the door, which, as she\r\nhad turned the key, she was forced to answer in person. She opened\r\nthe door, and there was Iphigenia Palliser, Jeffrey\'s cousin, and Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s cousin. "Miss Vavasor," she said, "I know that I am taking\r\na great liberty, but may I come into your room for a few minutes? I\r\nso much wish to speak to you!" Alice of course bade her enter, and\r\nplaced a chair for her by the fire.\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor had made very little intimacy with either of the two\r\nMiss Pallisers. It had seemed to herself as though there had been two\r\nparties in the house, and that she had belonged to the one which was\r\nheaded by the wife, whereas the Miss Pallisers had been naturally\r\nattached to that of the husband. These ladies, as she had already\r\nseen, almost idolized their cousin; and though Plantagenet Palliser\r\nhad till lately treated Alice with the greatest personal courtesy,\r\nthere had been no intimacy of friendship between them, and\r\nconsequently none between her and his special adherents. Nor was\r\neither of these ladies prone to sudden friendship with such a one\r\nas Alice Vavasor. A sudden friendship, with a snuffy president of a\r\nforeign learned society, with some personally unknown lady employed\r\non female emigration, was very much in their way. But Alice had not\r\nshown herself to be useful or learned, and her special intimacy with\r\nLady Glencora had marked her out as in some sort separated from them\r\nand their ways.\r\n\r\n"I know that I am intruding," said Miss Palliser, as though she were\r\nalmost afraid of Alice.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no," said Alice. "If I can do anything for you I shall be\r\nvery happy."\r\n\r\n"You are going to-morrow, and if I did not speak to you now I should\r\nhave no other opportunity. Glencora seems to be very much attached to\r\nyou, and we all thought it so good a thing that she should have such\r\na friend."\r\n\r\n"I hope you have not all changed your minds," said Alice, with a\r\nfaint smile, thinking as she spoke that the "all" must have been\r\nspecially intended to include the master of the house.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no;--by no means. I did not mean that. My cousin, Mr. Palliser,\r\nI mean, liked you so much when you came."\r\n\r\n"And he does not like me quite so much now, because I went out in the\r\nmoonlight with his wife. Isn\'t that it?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--no, Miss Vavasor. I had not intended to mention that at all.\r\nI had not indeed. I have seen him certainly since you came in,--just\r\nfor a minute, and he is vexed. But it is not about that that I would\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\n"I saw plainly enough that he was angry with me."\r\n\r\n"He thought you would have brought her in earlier."\r\n\r\n"And why should he think that I can manage his wife? She was\r\nthe mistress out there as she is in here. Mr. Palliser has been\r\nunreasonable. Not that it signifies."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he has been unreasonable; I don\'t, indeed, Miss\r\nVavasor. He has certainly been vexed. Sometimes he has much to vex\r\nhim. You see, Glencora is very young."\r\n\r\nMr. Bott also had declared that Lady Glencora was very young. It was\r\nprobable, therefore, that that special phrase had been used in some\r\ndiscussion among Mr. Palliser\'s party as to Glencora\'s foibles. So\r\nthought Alice as the remembrance of the word came upon her.\r\n\r\n"She is not younger than when Mr. Palliser married her," Alice said.\r\n\r\n"You mean that if a man marries a young wife he must put up with the\r\ntrouble. That is a matter of course. But their ages, in truth, are\r\nvery suitable. My cousin himself is not yet thirty. When I say that\r\nGlencora is young--"\r\n\r\n"You mean that she is younger in spirit, and perhaps in conduct, than\r\nhe had expected to find her."\r\n\r\n"But you are not to suppose that he complains, Miss Vavasor. He is\r\nmuch too proud for that."\r\n\r\n"I should hope so," said Alice, thinking of Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to explain to you what I wish to say, or how far\r\nI may be justified in supposing that you will believe me to be acting\r\nsolely on Glencora\'s behalf. I think you have some influence with\r\nher;--and I know no one else that has any."\r\n\r\n"My friendship with her is not of very long date, Miss Palliser."\r\n\r\n"I know it, but still there is the fact. Am I not right in\r\nsupposing--"\r\n\r\n"In supposing what?"\r\n\r\n"In supposing that you had heard the name of Mr. Fitzgerald as\r\nconnected with Glencora\'s before her marriage with my cousin?"\r\n\r\nAlice paused a moment before she answered.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had," she then said.\r\n\r\n"And I think you were agreed, with her other relations, that such a\r\nmarriage would have been very dreadful."\r\n\r\n"I never spoke of the matter in the presence of any relatives of\r\nGlencora\'s. You must understand, Miss Palliser, that though I am her\r\nfar-away cousin, I do not even know her nearest connections. I never\r\nsaw Lady Midlothian till she came here the other day."\r\n\r\n"But you advised her to abandon Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"I know she was much with you, just at that time."\r\n\r\n"I used to see her, certainly."\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, and Miss Palliser, in truth, scarcely knew\r\nhow to go on. There had been a hardness about Alice which her visitor\r\nhad not expected,--an unwillingness to speak or even to listen, which\r\nmade Miss Palliser almost wish that she were out of the room. She\r\nhad, however, mentioned Burgo Fitzgerald\'s name, and out of the room\r\nnow she could not go without explaining why she had done so. But at\r\nthis point Alice came suddenly to her assistance.\r\n\r\n"Just then she was often with me," said Alice, continuing her reply;\r\n"and there was much talk between us about Mr. Fitzgerald. What was\r\nmy advice then can be of little matter; but in this we shall be both\r\nagreed, Miss Palliser, that Glencora now should certainly not be\r\ncalled upon to be in his company."\r\n\r\n"She has told you, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she has told me."\r\n\r\n"That he is to be at Lady Monk\'s?"\r\n\r\n"She has told me that Mr. Palliser expects her to meet him at the\r\nplace to which they are going when they leave the Duke\'s, and that\r\nshe thinks it hard that she should be subjected to such a trial."\r\n\r\n"It should be no trial, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"How can it be otherwise? Come, Miss Palliser; if you are her friend,\r\nbe fair to her."\r\n\r\n"I am her friend;--but I am, above everything, my cousin\'s friend. He\r\nhas told me that she has complained of having to meet this man. He\r\ndeclares that it should be nothing to her, and that the fear is an\r\nidle folly. It should be nothing to her, but still the fear may not\r\nbe idle. Is there any reason,--any real reason,--why she should not\r\ngo? Miss Vavasor, I conjure you to tell me,--even though in doing so\r\nyou must cast so deep reproach upon her name! Anything will be better\r\nthan utter disgrace and sin!"\r\n\r\n"I conceive that I cast no reproach upon her in saying that there is\r\ngreat reason why she should not go to Monkshade."\r\n\r\n"You think there is absolute grounds for interference? I must tell\r\nhim, you know, openly what he would have to fear."\r\n\r\n"I think,--nay, Miss Palliser, I know,--that there is ample reason\r\nwhy you should save her from being taken to Monkshade, if you have\r\nthe power to do so."\r\n\r\n"I can only do it, or attempt to do it, by telling him just what you\r\ntell me."\r\n\r\n"Then tell him. You must have thought of that, I suppose, before you\r\ncame to me."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes, Miss Vavasor. I had thought of it. No doubt I had thought\r\nof it. But I had believed all through that you would assure me that\r\nthere was no danger. I believed that you would have said that she was\r\ninnocent."\r\n\r\n"And she is innocent," said Alice, rising from her chair, as though\r\nshe might thus give emphasis to words which she hardly dared to speak\r\nabove a whisper. "She is innocent. Who accuses her of guilt? You ask\r\nme a question on his behalf--"\r\n\r\n"On hers--and on his, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"A question which I feel myself bound to answer truly,--to answer\r\nwith reference to the welfare of them both; but I will not have it\r\nsaid that I accuse her. She had been attached to Mr. Fitzgerald when\r\nyour cousin married her. He knew that this had been the case. She\r\ntold him the whole truth. In a worldly point of view her marriage\r\nwith Mr. Fitzgerald would probably have been very imprudent."\r\n\r\n"It would have been utterly ruinous."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so; I say nothing about that. But as it turned out, she gave\r\nup her own wishes and married your cousin."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about her own wishes, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"It is what she did. She would have married Mr. Fitzgerald, had she\r\nnot been hindered by the advice of those around her. It cannot be\r\nsupposed that she has forgotten him in so short a time. There can be\r\nno guilt in her remembrance."\r\n\r\n"There is guilt in loving any other than her husband."\r\n\r\n"Then, Miss Palliser, it was her marriage that was guilty, and not\r\nher love. But all that is done and past. It should be your cousin\'s\r\nobject to teach her to forget Mr. Fitzgerald, and he will not do that\r\nby taking her to a house where that gentleman is staying."\r\n\r\n"She has said so much to you herself?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that I need declare to you what she has said herself.\r\nYou have asked me a question, and I have answered it, and I am\r\nthankful to you for having asked it. What object can either of us\r\nhave but to assist her in her position?"\r\n\r\n"And to save him from dishonour. I had so hoped that this was simply\r\na childish dread on her part."\r\n\r\n"It is not so. It is no childish dread. If you have the power to\r\nprevent her going to Lady Monk\'s, I implore you to use it. Indeed, I\r\nwill ask you to promise me that you will do so."\r\n\r\n"After what you have said, I have no alternative."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. There is no alternative. Either for his sake or for hers,\r\nthere is none."\r\n\r\nThereupon Miss Palliser got up, and wishing her companion good\r\nnight, took her departure. Throughout the interview there had been\r\nno cordiality of feeling between them. There was no pretence of\r\nfriendship, even as they were parting. They acknowledged that their\r\nobjects were different. That of Alice was to save Lady Glencora\r\nfrom ruin. That of Miss Palliser was to save her cousin from\r\ndisgrace,--with perhaps some further honest desire to prevent sorrow\r\nand sin. One loved Lady Glencora, and the other clearly did not love\r\nher. But, nevertheless, Alice felt that Miss Palliser, in coming to\r\nher, had acted well, and that to herself this coming had afforded\r\nimmense relief. Some step would now be taken to prevent that meeting\r\nwhich she had so deprecated, and it would be taken without any great\r\nviolation of confidence on her part. She had said nothing as to which\r\nLady Glencora could feel herself aggrieved.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning she was down in the breakfast-room soon after\r\nnine, and had not been in the room many minutes before Mr. Palliser\r\nentered. "The carriage is ordered for you at a quarter before ten,"\r\nhe said, "and I have come down to give you your breakfast." There was\r\na smile on his face as he spoke, and Alice could see that he intended\r\nto make himself pleasant.\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to give you yours instead?" said she. But as it\r\nhappened, no giving on either side was needed, as Alice\'s breakfast\r\nwas brought to her separately.\r\n\r\n"Glencora bids me say that she will be down immediately," said Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\nAlice then made some inquiry with reference to the effects of last\r\nnight\'s imprudence, which received only a half-pronounced reply.\r\nMr. Palliser was willing to be gracious, but did not intend to be\r\nunderstood as having forgiven the offence. The Miss Pallisers then\r\ncame in together, and after them Mr. Bott, closely followed by Mrs.\r\nMarsham, and all of them made inquiries after Lady Glencora, as\r\nthough it was to be supposed that she might probably be in a perilous\r\nstate after what she had undergone on the previous evening. Mr. Bott\r\nwas particularly anxious. "The frost was so uncommonly severe," said\r\nhe, "that any delicate person like Lady Glencora must have suffered\r\nin remaining out so long."\r\n\r\nThe insinuation that Alice was not a delicate person and that, as\r\nregarded her, the severity of the frost was of no moment, was very\r\nopen, and was duly appreciated. Mr. Bott was aware that his great\r\npatron had in some sort changed his opinion about Miss Vavasor, and\r\nhe was of course disposed to change his own. A fortnight since Alice\r\nmight have been as delicate as she pleased in Mr. Bott\'s estimation.\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not consider Lady Glencora delicate," said Alice to Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n"She is not robust," said the husband.\r\n\r\n"By no means," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no," said Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\nAlice knew that she was being accused of being robust herself; but\r\nshe bore it in silence. Ploughboys and milkmaids are robust, and the\r\naccusation was a heavy one. Alice, however, thought that she would\r\nnot have minded it, if she could have allowed herself to reply; but\r\nthis at the moment of her going away she could not do.\r\n\r\n"I think she is as strong as the rest of us," said Iphigenia\r\nPalliser, who felt that after last night she owed something to Miss\r\nVavasor.\r\n\r\n"As some of us," said Mr. Bott, determined to persevere in his\r\naccusation.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lady Glencora entered, and encountered the eager\r\ninquiries of her two duennas. These, however, she quickly put aside,\r\nand made her way up to Alice. "The last morning has come, then," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Alice. "Mr. Palliser must have thought that I was\r\nnever going."\r\n\r\n"On the other hand," said he, "I have felt much obliged to you for\r\nstaying." But he said it coldly; and Alice began to wish that she had\r\nnever seen Matching Priory.\r\n\r\n"Obliged!" exclaimed Lady Glencora. "I can\'t tell you how much\r\nobliged I am. Oh, Alice, I wish you were going to stay with us!"\r\n\r\n"We are leaving this in a week\'s time," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Of course we are," said Lady Glencora. "With all my heart I wish we\r\nwere not. Dear Alice! I suppose we shall not meet till we are all in\r\ntown."\r\n\r\n"You will let me know when you come up," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I will send to you instantly; and, Alice, I will write to you from\r\nGatherum,--or from Monkshade."\r\n\r\nAlice could not help looking around and catching Miss Palliser\'s eye.\r\nMiss Palliser was standing with her foot on the fender, but was so\r\nplaced that she could see Alice. She made a slight sign with her\r\nhead, as much as to say that Lady Glencora must have no opportunity\r\nof writing from the latter place; but she said nothing.\r\n\r\nThen the carriage was announced, and Mr. Palliser took Alice out on\r\nhis arm. "Don\'t come to the door, Glencora," he said. "I especially\r\nwish you not to do so." The two cousins then kissed each other, and\r\nAlice went away to the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Miss Vavasor," said Mr. Palliser; but he expressed no wish\r\nthat he might see her again as his guest at Matching Priory.\r\n\r\nAlice, as she was driven in solitary grandeur to the railway station,\r\ncould not but wish that she had never gone there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night before Christmas Eve two men were sitting together in\r\nGeorge Vavasor\'s rooms in Cecil Street. It was past twelve o\'clock,\r\nand they were both smoking; there were square bottles on the table\r\ncontaining spirits, with hot water and cold water in jugs, and one\r\nof the two men was using, and had been using, these materials for\r\nenjoyment. Vavasor had not been drinking, nor did it appear as though\r\nhe intended to begin. There was a little weak brandy and water in\r\na glass by his side, but there it had remained untouched for the\r\nlast twenty minutes. His companion, however, had twice in that time\r\nreplenished his beaker, and was now puffing out the smoke of his pipe\r\nwith the fury of a steamer\'s funnel when she has not yet burned the\r\nblack off her last instalment of fresh coals. This man was Burgo\r\nFitzgerald. He was as handsome as ever;--a man whom neither man nor\r\nwoman could help regarding as a thing beautiful to behold;--but\r\nnot the less was there in his eyes and cheeks a look of haggard\r\ndissipation,--of riotous living, which had become wearisome, by its\r\ncontinuance, even to himself,--that told to all who saw him much\r\nof the history of his life. Most men who drink at nights, and are\r\nout till cockcrow doing deeds of darkness, become red in their\r\nfaces, have pimpled cheeks and watery eyes, and are bloated and not\r\ncomfortable to be seen. It is a kind dispensation of Providence who\r\nthus affords to such sinners a visible sign, to be seen day by day,\r\nof the injury which is being done. The first approach of a carbuncle\r\non the nose, about the age of thirty, has stopped many a man from\r\ndrinking. No one likes to have carbuncles on his nose, or to appear\r\nbefore his female friends with eyes which look as though they were\r\nswimming in grog. But to Burgo Fitzgerald Providence in her anger had\r\nnot afforded this protection. He became at times pale, sallow, worn,\r\nand haggard. He grew thin, and still thinner. At times he had been\r\nill to death\'s door. Among his intimate friends there were those who\r\nheard him declare frequently that his liver had become useless to\r\nhim; and that, as for gastric juices, he had none left to him. But\r\nstill his beauty remained. The perfect form of his almost god-like\r\nface was the same as ever, and the brightness of his bright blue eye\r\nwas never quenched.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion he had come to Vavasor\'s room with the object\r\nof asking from him certain assistance, and perhaps also some amount\r\nof advice. But as regarded the latter article he was, I think, in the\r\nstate of most men when they seek for counsellors who shall counsel\r\nthem to do evil. Advice administered in accordance with his own views\r\nwould give him comfortable encouragement, but advice on the other\r\nside he was prepared to disregard altogether. These two men had known\r\neach other long, and a close intimacy had existed between them in the\r\ndays past, previous to Lady Glencora\'s engagement with Mr. Palliser.\r\nWhen Lady Glencora endeavoured, vainly as we know, to obtain aid from\r\nAlice Vavasor, Burgo had been instigated to believe that Alice\'s\r\ncousin might assist him. Any such assistance George Vavasor would\r\nhave been quite ready to give. Some pecuniary assistance he had\r\ngiven, he at that time having been in good funds. Perhaps he had for\r\na moment induced Burgo to think that he could obtain for the pair the\r\nuse of the house in Queen Anne Street as a point at which they might\r\nmeet, and from whence they might start on their journey of love. All\r\nthat was over. Those hopes had been frustrated, and Lady Glencora\r\nM\'Cluskie had become Lady Glencora Palliser and not Lady Glencora\r\nFitzgerald. But now other hopes had sprung up, and Burgo was again\r\nlooking to his friend for assistance.\r\n\r\n"I believe she would," Burgo said, as he lifted the glass to\r\nhis mouth. "It\'s a thing of that sort that a man can only\r\nbelieve,--perhaps only hope,--till he has tried. I know that she is\r\nnot happy with him, and I have made up my mind that I will at least\r\nask her."\r\n\r\n"But he would have her fortune all the same?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how that would be. I haven\'t inquired, and I don\'t mean\r\nto inquire. Of course I don\'t expect you or any one else to believe\r\nme, but her money has no bearing on the question now. Heaven knows I\r\nwant money bad enough, but I wouldn\'t take away another man\'s wife\r\nfor money."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you think it would be wicked. I supposed you\r\nto be above those prejudices."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you to chaff."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no chaff at all. I tell you fairly I wouldn\'t run away with any\r\nman\'s wife. I have an old-fashioned idea that when a man has got a\r\nwife he ought to be allowed to keep her. Public opinion, I know, is\r\nagainst me."\r\n\r\n"I think he ran away with my wife," said Burgo, with emphasis;\r\n"that\'s the way I look at it. She was engaged to me first; and she\r\nreally loved me, while she never cared for him."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, marriage is marriage, and the law is against you. But\r\nif I did go in for such a troublesome job at all, I certainly should\r\nkeep an eye upon the money."\r\n\r\n"It can make no difference."\r\n\r\n"It did make a difference, I suppose, when you first thought of\r\nmarrying her?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it did. My people brought us together because she had a\r\nlarge fortune and I had none. There\'s no doubt in the world about\r\nthat. And I\'ll tell you what; I believe that old harridan of an aunt\r\nof mine is willing to do the same thing now again. Of course she\r\ndoesn\'t say as much. She wouldn\'t dare do that, but I do believe she\r\nmeans it. I wonder where she expects to go to!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s grateful on your part."\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul I hate her. I do indeed. It isn\'t love for me now so\r\nmuch as downright malice against Palliser, because he baulked her\r\nproject before. She is a wicked old woman. Some of us fellows are\r\nwicked enough--you and I for instance--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I don\'t know, however, that I am qualified to run in a\r\ncurricle with you."\r\n\r\n"But we are angels to such an old she-devil as that. You may believe\r\nme or not, as you like.--I dare say you won\'t believe me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say I do, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, I want to get her, partly because I love her; but\r\nchiefly because I do believe in my heart that she loves me."\r\n\r\n"It\'s for her sake then! You are ready to sacrifice yourself to do\r\nher a good turn."\r\n\r\n"As for sacrificing myself, that\'s done. I\'m a man utterly ruined\r\nand would cut my throat to-morrow for the sake of my relations, if I\r\ncared enough about them. I know my own condition pretty well. I have\r\nmade a shipwreck of everything, and have now only got to go down\r\namong the breakers."\r\n\r\n"Only you would like to take Lady Glencora with you."\r\n\r\n"No, by heavens! But sometimes, when I do think about it at\r\nall,--which I do as seldom as I can,--it seems to me that I might\r\nstill become a different fellow if it were possible for me to marry\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Had you married her when she was free to marry any one and when her\r\nmoney was her own, it might have been so."\r\n\r\n"I think it would be quite as much so now. I do, indeed. If I could\r\nget her once, say to Italy, or perhaps to Greece, I think I could\r\ntreat her well, and live with her quietly. I know that I would try."\r\n\r\n"Without the assistance of brandy and cigars."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And without any money."\r\n\r\n"With only a little. I know you\'ll laugh at me; but I make pictures\r\nto myself of a sort of life which I think would suit us, and be very\r\ndifferent from this hideous way of living, with which I have become\r\nso sick that I loathe it."\r\n\r\n"Something like Juan and Haidee, with Planty Pall coming after you,\r\nlike old Lambro." By the nickname of Planty Pall George Vavasor\r\nintended to designate Lady Glencora\'s present husband.\r\n\r\n"He\'d get a divorce, of course, and then we should be married. I\r\nreally don\'t think he\'d dislike it, when it was all done. They tell\r\nme he doesn\'t care for her."\r\n\r\n"You have seen her since her marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; twice."\r\n\r\n"And have spoken to her?"\r\n\r\n"Once only,--so as to be able to do more than ask her if she were\r\nwell. Once, for about two minutes, I did speak to her."\r\n\r\n"And what did she say?"\r\n\r\n"She said it would be better that we should not meet. When she said\r\nthat, I knew that she was still fond of me. I could have fallen at\r\nher feet that moment, only the room was full of people. I do think\r\nthat she is fond of me."\r\n\r\nVavasor paused a few minutes. "I dare say she is fond of you," he\r\nthen said; "but whether she has pluck for such a thing as this, is\r\nmore than I can say. Probably she has not. And if she has, probably\r\nyou would fail in carrying out your plan."\r\n\r\n"I must get a little money first," said Burgo.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s an operation which no doubt you find more difficult every\r\nday, as you grow older."\r\n\r\n"It seems to be much the same sort of thing. I went to Magruin this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"He\'s the fellow that lives out near Gray\'s Inn Lane?"\r\n\r\n"Just beyond the Foundling Hospital. I went to him, and he was quite\r\ncivil about it. He says I owe him over three thousand pounds, but\r\nthat doesn\'t seem to make any difference."\r\n\r\n"How much did you ever have from him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t recollect that I ever absolutely had any money. He got a\r\nbill of mine from a tailor who went to smash, and he kept on renewing\r\nthat till it grew to be ever so many bills. I think he did once let\r\nme have twenty-four pounds,--but certainly never more than that."\r\n\r\n"And he says he\'ll give you money now? I suppose you told him why you\r\nwanted it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t name her,--but I told him what would make him understand\r\nthat I hoped to get off with a lady who had a lot of tin. I asked him\r\nfor two hundred and fifty. He says he\'ll let me have one hundred and\r\nfifty on a bill at two months for five hundred,--with your name to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"With my name to it! That\'s kind on his part,--and on yours too."\r\n\r\n"Of course I can\'t take it up at the end of two months."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"But he won\'t come upon you then,--nor for a year or more afterwards.\r\nI did pay you what you lent me before."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did. I always thought that to be a special compliment on\r\nyour part."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll find I\'ll pull you through now in some way. If I don\'t\r\nsucceed in this I shall go off the hooks altogether soon; and if I\r\nwere dead my people would pay my debts then."\r\n\r\nBefore the evening was over Vavasor promised the assistance asked\r\nof him. He knew that he was lending his name to a man who was\r\nutterly ruined, and putting it into the hands of another man who was\r\nabsolutely without conscience in the use he would make of it. He knew\r\nthat he was creating for himself trouble, and in all probability\r\nloss, which he was ill able to bear. But the thing was one which came\r\nwithin the pale of his laws. Such assistance as that he might ask of\r\nothers, and had asked and received before now. It was a reckless deed\r\non his part, but then all his doings were reckless. It was consonant\r\nwith his mode of life.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would, old fellow," said Burgo, as he got up to go\r\naway. "Perhaps, you know, I shall pull through in this; and perhaps,\r\nafter all, some part of her fortune will come with her. If so you\'ll\r\nbe all right."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may. But look here, Burgo,--don\'t you give that fellow up\r\nthe bill till you\'ve got the money into your fist."\r\n\r\n"You may be quite easy about that. I know their tricks. He and I will\r\ngo to the bank together, and we shall squabble there at the door\r\nabout four or five odd sovereigns,--and at last I shall have to give\r\nhim up two or three. Beastly old robber! I declare I think he\'s worse\r\nthan I am myself." Then Burgo Fitzgerald took a little more brandy\r\nand water and went away.\r\n\r\nHe was living at this time in the house of one of his relatives in\r\nCavendish Square, north of Oxford Street. His uncles and his aunts,\r\nand all those who were his natural friends, had clung to him with a\r\ntenacity that was surprising; for he had never been true to any of\r\nthem, and did not even pretend to like them. His father, with whom\r\nfor many years he had not been on speaking terms, was now dead; but\r\nhe had sisters whose husbands would still open their houses to him,\r\neither in London or in the country;--would open their houses to him,\r\nand lend him their horses, and provide him with every luxury which\r\nthe rich enjoy,--except ready money. When the uttermost stress of\r\npecuniary embarrassment would come upon him, they would pay something\r\nto stave off the immediate evil. And so Burgo went on. Nobody now\r\nthought of saying much to reproach him. It was known to be waste of\r\nwords, and trouble in vain. They were still fond of him because he\r\nwas beautiful and never vain of his beauty;--because in the midst\r\nof his recklessness there was always about him a certain kindliness\r\nwhich made him pleasant to those around him. He was soft and gracious\r\nwith children, and would be very courteous to his lady cousins. They\r\nknew that as a man he was worthless, but nevertheless they loved him.\r\nI think the secret of it was chiefly in this,--that he seemed to\r\nthink so little of himself.\r\n\r\nBut now as he walked home in the middle of the night from Cecil\r\nStreet to Cavendish Square he did think much of himself. Indeed such\r\nself-thoughts come naturally to all men, be their outward conduct\r\never so reckless. Every man to himself is the centre of the whole\r\nworld;--the axle on which it all turns. All knowledge is but his own\r\nperception of the things around him. All love, and care for others,\r\nand solicitude for the world\'s welfare, are but his own feelings as\r\nto the world\'s wants and the world\'s merits.\r\n\r\nHe had played his part as a centre of all things very badly. Of that\r\nhe was very well aware. He had sense enough to know that it should be\r\na man\'s lot to earn his bread after some fashion, and he often told\r\nhimself that never as yet had he earned so much as a penny roll. He\r\nhad learned to comprehend that the world\'s progress depends on the\r\nway in which men do their duty by each other,--that the progress\r\nof one generation depends on the discharge of such duties by that\r\nwhich preceded it;--and he knew that he, in his generation, had done\r\nnothing to promote such progress. He thoroughly despised himself,--if\r\nthere might be any good in that! But on such occasions as these, when\r\nthe wine he had drunk was sufficient only to drive away from him the\r\nnumbness of despair, when he was all alone with the cold night air\r\nupon his face, when the stars were bright above him and the world\r\naround him was almost quiet, he would still ask himself whether\r\nthere might not yet be, even for him, some hope of a redemption,\r\n--some chance of a better life in store for him. He was still\r\nyoung,--wanting some years of thirty. Could there be, even for him,\r\nsome mode of extrication from his misery?\r\n\r\nWe know what was the mode which now, at this moment, was suggesting\r\nitself to him. He was proposing to himself, as the best thing that he\r\ncould do, to take away another man\'s wife and make himself happy with\r\nher! What he had said to Vavasor as to disregarding Lady Glencora\'s\r\nmoney had been perfectly true. That in the event of her going off\r\nwith him, some portion of her enormous wealth would still cling to\r\nher, he did believe. Seeing that she had no children he could not\r\nunderstand where else it should all go. But he thought of this\r\nas it regarded her, not as it regarded him. When he had before\r\nmade his suit to her,--a suit which was then honourable, however\r\ndisadvantageous it might have seemed to be to her--he had made in his\r\nmind certain calculations as to the good things which would result\r\nto him if he were successful He would keep hounds, and have three or\r\nfour horses every day for his own riding, and he would have no more\r\ninterviews with Magruin, waiting in that rogue\'s dingy back parlour\r\nfor many a weary wretched half-hour, till the rogue should be pleased\r\nto show himself. So far he had been mercenary; but he had learned to\r\nlove the girl, and to care more for her than for her money, and when\r\nthe day of disappointment came upon him,--the day on which she had\r\ntold him that all between them was to be over for ever,--he had, for\r\na few hours, felt the loss of his love more than the loss of his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThen he had had no further hope. No such idea as that which now\r\nfilled his mind had then come upon him. The girl had gone from him\r\nand married another man, and there was an end of it. But by degrees\r\ntidings had reached him that she was not happy,--reaching him through\r\nthe mouths of people who were glad to exaggerate all that they had\r\nheard. A whole tribe of his female relatives had been anxious to\r\npromote his marriage with Lady Glencora M\'Cluskie, declaring that,\r\nafter all that was come and gone, Burgo would come forth from his\r\ntroubles as a man of great wealth. So great was the wealth of the\r\nheiress that it might withstand even his propensities for spending.\r\nThat whole tribe had been bitterly disappointed; and when they heard\r\nthat Mr. Palliser\'s marriage had given him no child, and that Lady\r\nGlencora was unhappy,--they made their remarks in triumph rather\r\nthan in sorrow. I will not say that they looked forward approvingly\r\nto such a step as that which Burgo now wished to take,--though as\r\nregarded his aunt, Lady Monk, he himself had accused her; but they\r\nwhispered that such things had been done and must be expected, when\r\nmarriages were made up as had been that marriage between Mr. Palliser\r\nand his bride.\r\n\r\nAs he walked on, thinking of his project, he strove hard to cheat\r\nhimself into a belief that he would do a good thing in carrying Lady\r\nGlencora away from her husband. Bad as had been his life he had\r\nnever before done aught so bad as that. The more fixed his intention\r\nbecame, the more thoroughly he came to perceive how great and\r\ngrievous was the crime which he contemplated. To elope with another\r\nman\'s wife no longer appeared to him to be a joke at which such men\r\nas he might smile. But he tried to think that in this case there\r\nwould be special circumstances which would almost justify him, and\r\nalso her. They had loved each other and had sworn to love each other\r\nwith constancy. There had been no change in the feelings or even in\r\nthe wishes of either of them. But cold people had come between them\r\nwith cold calculations, and had separated them. She had been, he told\r\nhimself, made to marry a man she did not love. If they two loved\r\neach other truly, would it not still be better that they should come\r\ntogether? Would not the sin be forgiven on account of the injustice\r\nwhich had been done to them? Had Mr. Palliser a right to expect more\r\nfrom a wife who had been made to marry him without loving him? Then\r\nhe reverted to those dreams of a life of love, in some sunny country,\r\nof which he had spoken to Vavasor, and he strove to nourish them.\r\nVavasor had laughed at him, talking of Juan and Haidee. But Vavasor,\r\nhe said to himself, was a hard cold man, who had no touch of romance\r\nin his character. He would not be laughed out of his plan by such as\r\nhe,--nor would he be frightened by the threat of any Lambro who might\r\ncome after him, whether he might come in the guise of indignant uncle\r\nor injured husband.\r\n\r\nHe had crossed from Regent Street through Hanover Square, and as he\r\ncame out by the iron gates into Oxford Street, a poor wretched girl,\r\nlightly clad in thin raiment, into whose bones the sharp freezing air\r\nwas penetrating, asked him for money. Would he give her something to\r\nget drink, so that for a moment she might feel the warmth of her life\r\nrenewed? Such midnight petitions were common enough in his ears, and\r\nhe was passing on without thinking of her. But she was urgent, and\r\ntook hold of him. "For love of God," she said, "if it\'s only a penny\r\nto get a glass of gin! Feel my hand,--how cold it is." And she strove\r\nto put it up against his face.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at her and saw that she was very young,--sixteen,\r\nperhaps, at the most, and that she had once,--nay very lately,--been\r\nexquisitely pretty. There still lingered about her eyes some remains\r\nof that look of perfect innocency and pure faith which had been hers\r\nnot more than twelve months since. And now, at midnight, in the\r\nmiddle of the streets, she was praying for a pennyworth of gin, as\r\nthe only comfort she knew, or could expect!\r\n\r\n"You are cold!" said he, trying to speak to her cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Cold!" said she, repeating the word, and striving to wrap herself\r\ncloser in her rags, as she shivered--"Oh God! if you knew what it\r\nwas to be as cold as I am! I have nothing in the world,--not one\r\npenny,--not a hole to lie in!"\r\n\r\n"We are alike then," said Burgo, with a slight low laugh. "I also\r\nhave nothing. You cannot be poorer than I am."\r\n\r\n"You poor!" she said. And then she looked up into his face.\r\n"Gracious; how beautiful you are! Such as you are never poor."\r\n\r\nHe laughed again,--in a different tone. He always laughed when any\r\none told him of his beauty. "I am a deal poorer than you, my girl,"\r\nhe said. "You have nothing. I have thirty thousand pounds worse than\r\nnothing. But come along, and I will get you something to eat."\r\n\r\n"Will you?" said she, eagerly. Then looking up at him again, she\r\nexclaimed--"Oh, you are so handsome!"\r\n\r\nHe took her to a public-house and gave her bread and meat and beer,\r\nand stood by her while she ate it. She was shy with him then, and\r\nwould fain have taken it to a corner by herself, had he allowed her.\r\nHe perceived this, and turned his back to her, but still spoke to her\r\na word or two as she ate. The woman at the bar who served him looked\r\nat him wonderingly, staring into his face; and the pot-boy woke\r\nhimself thoroughly that he might look at Burgo; and the waterman from\r\nthe cab-stand stared at him; and women who came in for gin looked\r\nalmost lovingly up into his eyes. He regarded them all not at all,\r\nshowing no feeling of disgrace at his position, and no desire to\r\ncarry himself as a ruffler. He quietly paid what was due when the\r\ngirl had finished her meal, and then walked with her out of the\r\nshop. "And now," said he, "what must I do with you? If I give you a\r\nshilling can you get a bed?" She told him that she could get a bed\r\nfor sixpence. "Then keep the other sixpence for your breakfast," said\r\nhe. "But you must promise me that you will buy no gin to-night." She\r\npromised him, and then he gave her his hand as he wished her good\r\nnight;--his hand, which it had been the dearest wish of Lady Glencora\r\nto call her own. She took it and pressed it to her lips. "I wish I\r\nmight once see you again," she said, "because you are so good and so\r\nbeautiful." He laughed again cheerily, and walked on, crossing the\r\nstreet towards Cavendish Square. She stood looking at him till he was\r\nout of sight, and then as she moved away,--let us hope to the bed\r\nwhich his bounty had provided, and not to a gin-shop,--she exclaimed\r\nto herself again and again--"Gracious, how beautiful he was!" "He\'s\r\na good un," the woman at the public-house had said as soon as he\r\nleft it; "but, my! did you ever see a man\'s face handsome as that\r\nfellow\'s?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Burgo Fitzgerald.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Burgo! All who had seen him since life had begun with him had\r\nloved him and striven to cherish him. And with it all, to what a\r\nstate had he come! Poor Burgo! had his eyes been less brightly blue,\r\nand his face less godlike in form, it may be that things would\r\nhave gone better with him. A sweeter-tempered man than he never\r\nlived,--nor one who was of a kinder nature. At this moment he had\r\nbarely money about him to take him down to his aunt\'s house at\r\nMonkshade, and as he had promised to be there before Christmas Day,\r\nhe was bound to start on the next morning, before help from Mr.\r\nMagruin was possible. Nevertheless, out of his very narrow funds he\r\nhad given half a crown to comfort the poor creature who had spoken to\r\nhim in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nContaining a Love Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nVavasor, as he sat alone in his room, after Fitzgerald had left him,\r\nbegan to think of the days in which he had before wished to assist\r\nhis friend in his views with reference to Lady Glencora;--or rather\r\nhe began to think of Alice\'s behaviour then, and of Alice\'s words.\r\nAlice had steadfastly refused to give any aid. No less likely\r\nassistant for such a purpose could have been selected. But she had\r\nbeen very earnest in declaring that it was Glencora\'s duty to stand\r\nby her promise to Burgo. "He is a desperate spendthrift," Kate\r\nVavasor had said to her. "Then let her teach him to be otherwise,"\r\nAlice had answered. "That might have been a good reason for refusing\r\nhis offer when he first made it; but it can be no excuse for untruth,\r\nnow that she has told him that she loves him!" "If a woman," she had\r\nsaid again, "won\'t venture her fortune for the man she loves, her\r\nlove is not worth having." All this George Vavasor remembered now;\r\nand as he remembered it he asked himself whether the woman that had\r\nonce loved him would venture her fortune for him still.\r\n\r\nThough his sister had pressed him on the subject with all the\r\nvehemence that she could use, he had hardly hitherto made up his\r\nmind that he really desired to marry Alice. There had grown upon\r\nhim lately certain Bohemian propensities,--a love of absolute\r\nindependence in his thoughts as well as actions,--which were\r\nantagonistic to marriage. He was almost inclined to think that\r\nmarriage was an old-fashioned custom, fitted indeed well enough for\r\nthe usual dull life of the world at large,--as many men both in\r\nheathen and in Christian ages have taught themselves to think of\r\nreligion,--but which was not adapted to his advanced intelligence.\r\nIf he loved any woman he loved his cousin Alice. If he thoroughly\r\nrespected any woman he respected her. But that idea of tying himself\r\ndown to a household was in itself distasteful to him. "It is a thing\r\nterrible to think of," he once said to a congenial friend in these\r\ndays of his life, "that a man should give permission to a priest\r\nto tie him to another human being like a Siamese twin, so that all\r\npower of separate and solitary action should be taken from him for\r\never! The beasts of the field do not treat each other so badly. They\r\nneither drink themselves drunk, nor eat themselves stupid;--nor do\r\nthey bind themselves together in a union which both would have to\r\nhate." In this way George Vavasor, trying to imitate the wisdom of\r\nthe brutes, had taught himself some theories of a peculiar nature.\r\nBut, nevertheless, as he thought of Alice Vavasor on this occasion,\r\nhe began to feel that if a Siamese twin were necessary for him, she\r\nof all others was the woman to whom he would wish to be so bound.\r\n\r\nAnd if he did it at all, he must do it now. Under the joint\r\ninstigation of himself and his sister,--as he thought, and perhaps\r\nnot altogether without reason,--she had broken her engagement with Mr.\r\nGrey. That she would renew it again if left to herself, he believed\r\nprobable. And then, despite that advanced intelligence which had\r\ntaught him to regard all forms and ceremonies with the eye of a\r\nphilosopher, he had still enough of human frailty about him to feel\r\nkeenly alive to the pleasure of taking from John Grey the prize which\r\nJohn Grey had so nearly taken from him. If Alice could have been\r\ntaught to think as he did as to the absurdity of those indissoluble\r\nties, that would have been better. But nothing would have been more\r\nimpossible than the teaching of such a lesson to his cousin Alice.\r\nGeorge Vavasor was a man of courage, and dared do most things;--but\r\nhe would not have dared to commence the teaching of such a lesson to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at this moment, what was his outlook into life generally? He\r\nhad very high ambition, and a fair hope of gratifying it if he could\r\nonly provide that things should go well with him for a year or so. He\r\nwas still a poor man, having been once nearly a rich man; but still\r\nso much of the result of his nearly acquired riches remained to him,\r\nthat on the strength of them he might probably find his way into\r\nParliament. He had paid the cost of the last attempt, and might,\r\nin a great degree, carry on this present attempt on credit. If he\r\nsucceeded there would be open to him a mode of life, agreeable in\r\nitself, and honourable among men. But how was he to bear the cost\r\nof this for the next year, or the next two years? His grandfather\r\nwas still alive, and would probably live over that period. If he\r\nmarried Alice he would do so with no idea of cheating her out of her\r\nmoney. She should learn,--nay, she had already learned from his own\r\nlips,--how perilous was his enterprise. But he knew her to be a woman\r\nwho would boldly risk all in money, though no consideration would\r\ninduce her to stir a hair\'s breadth towards danger in reputation.\r\nTowards teaching her that doctrine at which I have hinted, he would\r\nnot have dared to make an attempt; but he felt that he should have no\r\nrepugnance to telling her that he wanted to spend all her money in\r\nthe first year or two of their married life!\r\n\r\nHe was still in his arm-chair, thinking of all this, with that small\r\nuntasted modicum of brandy and water beside him, when he heard some\r\ndistant Lambeth clock strike three from over the river. Then he rose\r\nfrom his seat, and taking the candles in his hand, sat himself down\r\nat a writing-desk on the other side of the room. "I needn\'t send it\r\nwhen it\'s written," he said to himself, "and the chances are that I\r\nwon\'t." Then he took his paper, and wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR ALICE,\r\n\r\n   The time was when the privilege was mine of beginning my\r\n   letters to you with a warmer show of love than the above\r\n   word contains,--when I might and did call you dearest; but\r\n   I lost that privilege through my own folly, and since that\r\n   it has been accorded to another. But you have found,--with\r\n   a thorough honesty of purpose than which I know nothing\r\n   greater,--that it has behoved you to withdraw that\r\n   privilege also. I need hardly say that I should not have\r\n   written as I now write, had you not found it expedient to\r\n   do as you have done. I now once again ask you to be my\r\n   wife. In spite of all that passed in those old days,--of\r\n   all the selfish folly of which I was then guilty, I think\r\n   you know, and at the time knew, that I ever loved you.\r\n   I claim to say for myself that my love to you was true\r\n   from first to last, and I claim from you belief for that\r\n   statement. Indeed I do not think that you ever doubted my\r\n   love.\r\n\r\n   Nevertheless, when you told me that I might no longer hope\r\n   to make you my wife, I had no word of remonstrance that\r\n   I could utter. You acted as any woman would act whom love\r\n   had not made a fool. Then came the episode of Mr. Grey;\r\n   and bitter as have been my feelings whilst that engagement\r\n   lasted, I never made any attempt to come between you and\r\n   the life you had chosen. In saying this I do not forget\r\n   the words which I spoke last summer at Basle, when, as\r\n   far as I knew, you still intended that he should be your\r\n   husband. But what I said then was nothing to that which,\r\n   with much violence, I refrained from saying. Whether you\r\n   remember those few words I cannot tell; but certainly\r\n   you would not have remembered them,--would not even have\r\n   noticed them,--had your heart been at Nethercoats.\r\n\r\n   But all this is nothing. You are now again a free woman;\r\n   and once again I ask you to be my wife. We are both older\r\n   than we were when we loved before, and will both be prone\r\n   to think of marriage in a somewhat different light. Then\r\n   personal love for each other was most in our thoughts. God\r\n   forbid that it should not be much in our thoughts now!\r\n   Perhaps I am deceiving myself in saying that it is not\r\n   even now stronger in mine than any other consideration.\r\n   But we have both reached that time of life, when it is\r\n   probable that in any proposition of marriage we should\r\n   think more of our adaptability to each other than we\r\n   did before. For myself I know that there is much in my\r\n   character and disposition to make me unfit to marry a\r\n   woman of the common stamp. You know my mode of life,\r\n   and what are my hopes and my chances of success. I run\r\n   great risk of failing. It may be that I shall encounter\r\n   ruin where I look for reputation and a career of honour.\r\n   The chances are perhaps more in favour of ruin than of\r\n   success. But, whatever may be the chances, I shall go on\r\n   as long as any means of carrying on the fight are at my\r\n   disposal. If you were my wife to-morrow I should expect to\r\n   use your money, if it were needed, in struggling to obtain\r\n   a seat in Parliament and a hearing there. I will hardly\r\n   stoop to tell you that I do not ask you to be my wife for\r\n   the sake of this aid;--but if you were to become my wife\r\n   I should expect all your cooperation;--with your money,\r\n   possibly, but certainly with your warmest spirit.\r\n\r\n   And now, once again, Alice,--dearest Alice, will you\r\n   be my wife? I have been punished, and I have kissed the\r\n   rod,--as I never kissed any other rod. You cannot accuse\r\n   my love. Since the time in which I might sit with my arm\r\n   round your waist, I have sat with it round no other waist.\r\n   Since your lips were mine, no other lips have been dear\r\n   to me. Since you were my counsellor, I have had no other\r\n   counsellor,--unless it be poor Kate, whose wish that we\r\n   may at length be married is second in earnestness only\r\n   to my own. Nor do I think you will doubt my repentance.\r\n   Such repentance indeed claims no merit, as it has been\r\n   the natural result of the loss which I have suffered.\r\n   Providence has hitherto been very good to me in not having\r\n   made that loss irremediable by your marriage with Mr. Grey.\r\n   I wish you now to consider the matter well, and to tell me\r\n   whether you can pardon me and still love me. Do I flatter\r\n   myself when I feel that I doubt your pardon almost more\r\n   than I doubt your love?\r\n\r\n   Think of this thing in all its bearings before you answer\r\n   me. I am so anxious that you should think of it that I\r\n   will not expect your reply till this day week. It can\r\n   hardly be your desire to go through life unmarried. I\r\n   should say that it must be essential to your ambition that\r\n   you should join your lot to that of some man the nature\r\n   of whose aspirations would be like to your own. It is\r\n   because this was not so as regarded him whose suit you had\r\n   accepted, that you found yourself at last obliged to part\r\n   from him. May I not say that with us there would be no\r\n   such difference? It is because I believe that in this\r\n   respect we are fitted for each other, as man and woman\r\n   seldom are fitted, that I once again ask you to be my\r\n   wife.\r\n\r\n   This will reach you at Vavasor, where you will now be with\r\n   the old squire and Kate. I have told her nothing of my\r\n   purpose in writing this letter. If it should be that your\r\n   answer is such as I desire, I should use the opportunity\r\n   of our re-engagement to endeavour to be reconciled to my\r\n   grandfather. He has misunderstood me and has ill-used me.\r\n   But I am ready to forgive that, if he will allow me to\r\n   do so. In such case you and Kate would arrange that, and\r\n   I would, if possible, go down to Vavasor while you are\r\n   there. But I am galloping on a-head foolishly in thinking\r\n   of this, and am counting up my wealth while the crockery\r\n   in my basket is so very fragile. One word from you will\r\n   decide whether or no I shall ever bring it into market.\r\n\r\n   If that word is to be adverse do not say anything\r\n   of a meeting between me and the Squire. Under such\r\n   circumstances it would be impossible. But, oh, Alice! do\r\n   not let it be adverse. I think you love me. Your woman\'s\r\n   pride towards me has been great and good and womanly; but\r\n   it has had its way; and, if you love me, might now be\r\n   taught to succumb.\r\n\r\n   Dear Alice, will you be my wife?\r\n\r\n   Yours, in any event, most affectionately,\r\n\r\n   GEORGE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nVavasor, when he had finished his letter, went back to his seat over\r\nthe fire, and there he sat with it close at his hand for nearly an\r\nhour. Once or twice he took it up with fingers almost itching to\r\nthrow it into the fire. He took it up and held the corners between\r\nhis forefinger and thumb, throwing forward his hand towards the\r\nflame, as though willing that the letter should escape from him and\r\nperish if chance should so decide. But chance did not so decide, and\r\nthe letter was put back upon the table at his elbow. Then when the\r\nhour was nearly over he read it again. "I\'ll bet two to one that she\r\ngives way," he said to himself, as he put the sheet of paper back\r\ninto the envelope. "Women are such out-and-out fools." Then he took\r\nhis candle, and carrying his letter with him, went into his bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was the morning of Christmas Eve. At about nine\r\no\'clock a boy came into his room who was accustomed to call for\r\norders for the day. "Jem," he said to the boy, "there\'s half a crown\r\nlying there on the looking-glass." Jem looked and acknowledged the\r\npresence of the half-crown. "Is it a head or a tail, Jem?" asked\r\nthe boy\'s master. Jem scrutinized the coin, and declared that the\r\nuppermost surface showed a tail. "Then take that letter and post it,"\r\nsaid George Vavasor. Whereupon Jem, asking no question and thinking\r\nbut little of the circumstances under which the command was given,\r\ndid take the letter and did post it. In due accordance with postal\r\nregulations it reached Vavasor Hall and was delivered to Alice on the\r\nChristmas morning.\r\n\r\nA merry Christmas did not fall to the lot of George Vavasor on the\r\npresent occasion. An early Christmas-box he did receive in the shape\r\nof a very hurried note from his friend Burgo. "This will be brought\r\nto you by Stickling," the note said; but who Stickling was Vavasor\r\ndid not know. "I send the bill. Couldn\'t you get the money and send\r\nit me, as I don\'t want to go up to town again before the thing comes\r\noff? You\'re a trump; and will do the best you can. Don\'t let that\r\nrogue off for less than a hundred and twenty.--Yours, B. F." Vavasor,\r\ntherefore, having nothing better to do, spent his Christmas morning\r\nin calling on Mr. Magruin.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Vavasor," said Magruin; "really this is no morning for\r\nbusiness!"\r\n\r\n"Time and tide wait for no man, Mr. Magruin, and my friend wants his\r\nmoney to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Vavasor,--to-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to-morrow. If time and tide won\'t wait, neither will love.\r\nCome, Mr. Magruin, out with your cheque-book, and don\'t let\'s have any\r\nnonsense."\r\n\r\n"But is the lady sure, Mr. Vavasor?" asked Mr. Magruin, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Ladies never are sure," said Vavasor; "hardly more sure than bills\r\nmade over to money-lenders. I\'m not going to wait here all day. Are\r\nyou going to give him the money?"\r\n\r\n"Christmas-day, Mr. Vavasor! There\'s no getting money in the city\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nBut Vavasor before he left did get the money from Mr. Magruin,--L122\r\n10s.--for which an acceptance at two months for L500 was given\r\nin exchange,--and carried it off in triumph. "Do tell him to be\r\npunctual," said Mr. Magruin, when Vavasor took his leave. "I do so\r\nlike young men to be punctual. But I really think Mr. Fitzgerald is\r\nthe most unpunctual young man I ever did know yet."\r\n\r\n"I think he is," said George Vavasor, as he went away.\r\n\r\nHe ate his Christmas dinner in absolute solitude at an eating-house\r\nnear his lodgings. It may be supposed that no man dares to dine at\r\nhis club on a Christmas Day. He at any rate did not so dare;--and\r\nafter dinner he wandered about through the streets, wondering within\r\nhis mind how he would endure the restraints of married life. And the\r\nsame dull monotony of his days was continued for a week, during which\r\nhe waited, not impatiently, for an answer to his letter. And before\r\nthe end of the week the answer came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nAmong the Fells.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice came down to breakfast on that Christmas morning at Vavasor\r\nHall without making any sign as to the letter she had received. The\r\nparty there consisted of her grandfather, her father, her cousin\r\nKate, and herself. They all made their Christmas salutations as is\r\nusual, and Alice received and made hers as did the others, without\r\nshowing that anything had occurred to disturb her tranquillity. Kate\r\nremarked that she had heard that morning from Aunt Greenow, and\r\npromised to show Alice the letter after breakfast. But Alice said no\r\nword of her own letter.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t your aunt come here to eat her Christmas dinner?" said\r\nthe Squire.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, sir, because you didn\'t ask her," said Kate, standing close\r\nto her grandfather,--for the old man was somewhat deaf.\r\n\r\n"And why didn\'t you ask her;--that is, if she stands upon asking to\r\ncome to her old home?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, sir, but I couldn\'t do that without your bidding. We Vavasors\r\nare not always fond of meeting each other."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Kate. I know what you mean, and you should be the\r\nlast to speak of it. Alice, my dear, come and sit next to me. I am\r\nmuch obliged to you for coming down all this way to see your old\r\ngrandfather at Christmas. I am indeed. I only wish you had brought\r\nbetter news about your sweetheart."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll think better of it before long, sir," said her father.\r\n\r\n"Papa, you shouldn\'t say that. You would not wish me to marry against\r\nmy own judgement."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about ladies\' judgements," said the old man. "It\r\ndoes seem to me that when a lady makes a promise she ought to keep\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"According to that," said Kate, "if I were engaged to a man, and\r\nfound that he was a murderer, I still ought to marry him."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Grey is not a murderer," said the Squire.\r\n\r\n"Pray,--pray, don\'t talk about it," said Alice. "If you do I really\r\ncannot sit and hear it."\r\n\r\n"I have given over saying anything on the subject," said John\r\nVavasor, speaking as though he had already expended upon it a vast\r\namount of paternal eloquence. He had, however, never said more than\r\nhas been recorded in these pages. Alice during this conversation, sat\r\nwith her cousin\'s letter in her pocket, and as yet had not even begun\r\nto think what should be the nature of her reply.\r\n\r\nThe Squire of Vavasor Hall was a stout old man, with a red face and\r\ngrey eyes, which looked fiercely at you, and with long grey hair, and\r\na rough grey beard, which gave him something of the appearance of an\r\nold lion. He was passionate, unreasoning, and specially impatient\r\nof all opposition; but he was affectionate, prone to forgive when\r\nasked to do so, unselfish, and hospitable. He was, moreover, guided\r\nstrictly by rules, which he believed to be rules of right. His\r\ngrandson George had offended him very deeply,--had offended him\r\nand never asked his pardon. He was determined that such pardon\r\nshould never be given, unless it were asked for with almost bended\r\nknees; but, nevertheless, this grandson should be his heir. That\r\nwas his present intention. The right of primogeniture could not, in\r\naccordance with his theory, be abrogated by the fact that it was, in\r\nGeorge Vavasor\'s case, protected by no law. The Squire could leave\r\nVavasor Hall to whom he pleased, but he could not have hoped to rest\r\nquietly in his grave should it be found that he had left it to any\r\none but the eldest son of his own eldest son. Though violent, and\r\neven stern, he was more prone to love than to anger; and though none\r\nof those around him dared to speak to him of his grandson, yet he\r\nlonged in his heart for some opportunity of being reconciled to him.\r\n\r\nThe whole party went to church on this Christmas morning. The small\r\nparish church of Vavasor, an unpretending wooden structure, with a\r\nsingle bell which might be heard tinkling for a mile or two over\r\nthe fells, stood all alone about half a mile from the Squire\'s gate.\r\nVavasor was a parish situated on the intermediate ground between\r\nthe mountains of the lake country and the plains. Its land was\r\nunproductive, ill-drained, and poor, and yet it possessed little or\r\nnone of the beauty which tourists go to see. It was all amidst the\r\nfells, and very dreary. There were long skirtings of dark pines\r\naround a portion of the Squire\'s property, and at the back of the\r\nhouse there was a thick wood of firs running up to the top of what\r\nwas there called the Beacon Hill. Through this there was a wild steep\r\nwalk which came out upon the moorland, and from thence there was a\r\ntrack across the mountain to Hawes Water and Naddale, and on over\r\nmany miles to the further beauties of Bowness and Windermere. They\r\nwho knew the country, and whose legs were of use to them, could find\r\nsome of the grandest scenery in England within reach of a walk from\r\nVavasor Hall; but to others the place was very desolate. For myself,\r\nI can find I know not what of charm in wandering over open, unadorned\r\nmoorland. It must be more in the softness of the grass to the feet,\r\nand the freshness of the air to the lungs, than in anything that\r\nmeets the eye. You might walk for miles and miles to the north-east,\r\nor east, or south-east of Vavasor without meeting any object to\r\narrest the view. The great road from Lancaster to Carlisle crossed\r\nthe outskirts of the small parish about a mile from the church, and\r\nbeyond that the fell seemed to be interminable. Towards the north\r\nit rose, and towards the south it fell, and it rose and fell very\r\ngradually. Here and there some slight appearance of a valley might\r\nbe traced which had been formed by the action of the waters; but\r\nsuch breakings of ground were inconsiderable, and did not suffice to\r\ninterrupt the stern sameness of the everlasting moorland.\r\n\r\nThe daily life at Vavasor was melancholy enough for such a one as the\r\nSquire\'s son, who regarded London as the only place on the earth\'s\r\nsurface in which a man could live with comfort. The moors offered\r\nno charms to him. Nor did he much appreciate the homely comforts of\r\nthe Hall; for the house, though warm, was old-fashioned and small,\r\nand the Squire\'s cook was nearly as old as the Squire himself. John\r\nVavasor\'s visits to Vavasor were always visits of duty rather than of\r\npleasure. But it was not so with Alice. She could be very happy there\r\nwith Kate; for, like herself, Kate was a good walker and loved the\r\nmountains. Their regard for each other had grown and become strong\r\nbecause they had gone together o\'er river and moor, and because they\r\nhad together disregarded those impediments of mud and wet which\r\nfrighten so many girls away from the beauties of nature.\r\n\r\nOn this Christmas Day they all went to church, the Squire being\r\naccompanied by Alice in a vehicle which in Ireland is called an\r\ninside jaunting-car, and which is perhaps the most uncomfortable kind\r\nof vehicle yet invented; while John Vavasor walked with his niece.\r\nBut the girls had arranged that immediately after church they would\r\nstart for a walk up the Beacon Hill, across the fells, towards Hawes\r\nWater. They always dined at the Hall at the vexatious hour of five;\r\nbut as their church service, with the sacrament included, would\r\nbe completed soon after twelve, and as lunch was a meal which the\r\nSquire did not himself attend, they could have full four hours for\r\ntheir excursion. This had all been planned before Alice received her\r\nletter; but there was nothing in that to make her change her mind\r\nabout the walk.\r\n\r\n"Alice, my dear," said the old man to her when they were together in\r\nthe jaunting-car, "you ought to get married." The Squire was hard\r\nof hearing, and under any circumstances an inside jaunting-car is a\r\nbad place for conversation, as your teeth are nearly shaken out of\r\nyour head by every movement which the horse makes. Alice therefore\r\nsaid nothing, but smiled faintly, in reply to her grandfather. On\r\nreturning from church he insisted that Alice should again accompany\r\nhim, telling her specially that he desired to speak to her. "My dear\r\nchild," he said, "I have been thinking a great deal about you, and\r\nyou ought to get married."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, perhaps I shall some day."\r\n\r\n"Not if you quarrel with all your suitors," said the old man. "You\r\nquarrelled with your cousin George, and now you have quarrelled with\r\nMr. Grey. You\'ll never get married, my dear, if you go on in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Why should I be married more than Kate?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kate! I don\'t know that anybody wants to marry Kate. I wish\r\nyou\'d think of what I say. If you don\'t get married before long,\r\nperhaps you\'ll never get married at all. Gentlemen won\'t stand that\r\nkind of thing for ever."\r\n\r\nThe two girls took a slice of cake each in her hand, and started on\r\ntheir walk. "We shan\'t be able to get to the lake," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"No," said Alice; "but we can go as far as the big stone on Swindale\r\nFell, where we can sit down and see it."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the last time we sat there?" said Kate. "It is\r\nnearly three years ago, and it was then that you told me that all was\r\nto be over between you and George. Do you remember what a fool I was,\r\nand how I screamed in my sorrow? I sometimes wonder at myself and my\r\nown folly. How is it that I can never get up any interest about my\r\nown belongings? And then we got soaking wet through coming home."\r\n\r\n"I remember that very well."\r\n\r\n"And how dark it was! That was in September, but we had dined early.\r\nIf we go as far as Swindale we shall have it very dark coming home\r\nto-day;--but I don\'t mind that through the Beacon Wood, because I\r\nknow my way so well. You won\'t be afraid of half an hour\'s dark?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I do remember that day. Well; it\'s all for the best, I suppose.\r\nAnd now I must read you my aunt\'s letter." Then, while they were\r\nstill in the wood, Kate took out the letter from her aunt and read\r\nit, while they still walked slowly up the hill. It seemed that\r\nhitherto neither of her two suitors had brought the widow to terms.\r\nIndeed, she continued to write of Mr. Cheesacre as though that\r\ngentleman were inconsolable for the loss of Kate, and gave her niece\r\nmuch serious advice as to the expedience of returning to Norfolk,\r\nin order that she might secure so eligible a husband. "You must\r\nunderstand all the time, Alice," said Kate, pausing as she read the\r\nletter, "that the dear man has never given me the slightest ground\r\nfor the faintest hope, and that I know to a certainty that he makes\r\nan offer to her twice a week,--that is, on every market day. You\r\ncan\'t enjoy half the joke if you won\'t bear that in mind." Alice\r\npromised that she would bear it all in mind, and then Kate went on\r\nwith her reading. Poor Bellfield was working very hard at his drill,\r\nMrs. Greenow went on to say; so hard that sometimes she really thought\r\nthe fatigue would be too much for his strength. He would come in\r\nsometimes of an evening and just take a cup of tea;--generally on\r\nMondays and Thursdays. "These are not market days at Norwich," said\r\nKate; "and thus unpleasant meetings are avoided." "He comes in," said\r\nMrs. Greenow, "and takes a little tea; and sometimes I think that\r\nhe will faint at my feet." "That he kneels there on every occasion,"\r\nsaid Kate, "and repeats his offer also twice a week, I have not the\r\nleast doubt in the world."\r\n\r\n"And will she accept him at last?"\r\n\r\n"Really I don\'t know what to think of it. Sometimes I fancy that\r\nshe likes the fun of the thing, but that she is too wide-awake to\r\nput herself in any man\'s power. I have no doubt she lends him money,\r\nbecause he wants it sadly and she is very generous. She gives him\r\nmoney, I feel sure, but takes his receipt on stamped paper for every\r\nshilling. That\'s her character all over."\r\n\r\nThe letter then went on to say that the writer had made up her mind\r\nto remain at Norwich certainly through the winter and spring, and\r\nthat she was anxiously desirous that her dear Kate should go back to\r\nher. "Come and have one other look at Oileymead," said the letter,\r\n"and then, if you make up your mind that you don\'t like it or him, I\r\nwon\'t ask you to think of them ever again. I believe him to be a very\r\nhonest fellow." "Did you ever know such a woman?" said Kate; "with\r\nall her faults I believe she would go through fire and water to serve\r\nme. I think she\'d lend me money without any stamped paper." Then Aunt\r\nGreenow\'s letter was put up, and the two girls had come out upon the\r\nopen fell.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious afternoon for a winter\'s walk. The air was clear\r\nand cold, but not actually frosty. The ground beneath their feet\r\nwas dry, and the sky, though not bright, had that appearance of\r\nenduring weather which gives no foreboding of rain. There is a\r\nspecial winter\'s light, which is very clear though devoid of all\r\nbrilliancy,--through which every object strikes upon the eye with\r\nwell-marked lines, and under which almost all forms of nature seem\r\ngraceful to the sight if not actually beautiful. But there is a\r\ncertain melancholy which ever accompanies it. It is the light of\r\nthe afternoon, and gives token of the speedy coming of the early\r\ntwilight. It tells of the shortness of the day, and contains even in\r\nits clearness a promise of the gloom of night. It is absolute light,\r\nbut it seems to contain the darkness which is to follow it. I do not\r\nknow that it is ever to be seen and felt so plainly as on the wide\r\nmoorland, where the eye stretches away over miles, and sees at the\r\nworld\'s end the faint low lines of distant clouds settling themselves\r\nupon the horizon. Such was the light of this Christmas afternoon, and\r\nboth the girls had felt the effects of it before they reached the big\r\nstone on Swindale Fell, from which they intended to look down upon\r\nthe loveliness of Hawes Water. As they went up through the wood there\r\nhad been some laughter between them over Aunt Greenow\'s letter; and\r\nthey had discussed almost with mirth the merits of Oileymead and\r\nMr. Cheesacre; but as they got further on to the fell, and as the\r\nhalf-melancholy wildness of the place struck them, their words became\r\nless light, and after a while they almost ceased to speak.\r\n\r\nAlice had still her letter in her pocket. She had placed it there\r\nwhen she came down to breakfast, and had carried it with her since.\r\nShe had come to no resolution as yet as to her answer to it, nor had\r\nshe resolved whether or no she would show it to Kate. Kate had ever\r\nbeen regarded by her as her steadfast friend. In all these affairs\r\nshe had spoken openly to Kate. We know that Kate had in part betrayed\r\nher, but Alice suspected no such treason. She had often quarrelled\r\nwith Kate; but she had quarrelled with her not on account of any sin\r\nagainst the faith of their friendship. She believed in her cousin\r\nperfectly, though she found herself often called upon to disagree\r\nwith her almost violently. Why should she not show this letter to\r\nKate, and discuss it in all its bearings before she replied to it?\r\nThis was in her mind as she walked silently along over the fell.\r\n\r\nThe reader will surmise from this that she was already half inclined\r\nto give way, and to join her lot to that of her cousin George. Alas,\r\nyes! The reader will be right in his surmise. And yet it was not her\r\nlove for the man that prompted her to run so terrible a risk. Had\r\nit been so, I think that it would be easier to forgive her. She was\r\nbeginning to think that love,--the love of which she had once thought\r\nso much,--did not matter. Of what use was it, and to what had it led?\r\nWhat had love done for her friend Glencora? What had love done for\r\nher? Had she not loved John Grey, and had she not felt that with\r\nall her love life with him would have been distasteful to her? It\r\nwould have been impossible for her to marry a man whom personally she\r\ndisliked; but she liked her cousin George,--well enough, as she said\r\nto herself almost indifferently.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole it was a grievous task to her in these days,--this\r\nhaving to do something with her life. Was it not all vain and futile?\r\nAs for that girl\'s dream of the joys of love which she had once\r\ndreamed,--that had gone from her slumbers, never to return. How might\r\nshe best make herself useful,--useful in some sort that might gratify\r\nher ambition;--that was now the question which seemed to her to be of\r\nmost importance.\r\n\r\nHer cousin\'s letter to her had been very crafty. He had studied the\r\nwhole of her character accurately as he wrote it. When he had sat\r\ndown to write it he had been indifferent to the result; but he had\r\nwritten it with that care to attain success which a man uses when he\r\nis anxious not to fail in an attempt. Whether or no he cared to marry\r\nhis cousin was a point so little interesting to him that chance might\r\ndecide it for him; but when chance had decided that he did wish it,\r\nit was necessary for his honour that he should have that for which he\r\ncondescended to ask.\r\n\r\nHis letter to her had been clever and very crafty. "At any rate he\r\ndoes me justice," she said to herself, when she read those words\r\nabout her money, and the use which he proposed to make of it. "He is\r\nwelcome to it all if it will help him in his career, whether he has\r\nit as my friend or as my husband." Then she thought of Kate\'s promise\r\nof her little mite, and declared to herself that she would not be\r\nless noble than her cousin Kate. And would it not be well that she\r\nshould be the means of reconciling George to his grandfather? George\r\nwas the representative of the family,--of a family so old that no one\r\nnow knew which had first taken the ancient titular name of some old\r\nSaxon landowner,--the parish, or the man. There had been in old days\r\nsome worthy Vavaseurs, as Chaucer calls them, whose rank and bearing\r\nhad been adopted on the moorland side. Of these things Alice thought\r\nmuch, and felt that it should be her duty so to act, that future\r\nVavasors might at any rate not be less in the world than they who\r\nhad passed away. In a few years at furthest, George Vavasor must be\r\nVavasor of Vavasor. Would it not be right that she should help him to\r\nmake that position honourable?\r\n\r\nThey walked on, exchanging now and again a word or two, till the\r\ndistant Cumberland mountains began to form themselves in groups of\r\nbeauty before their eyes. "There\'s Helvellyn at last," said Kate.\r\n"I\'m always happy when I see that." "And isn\'t that Kidsty Pike?"\r\nasked Alice. "No; you don\'t see Kidsty yet. But you will when you\r\nget up to the bank there. That\'s Scaw Fell on the left;--the round\r\ndistant top. I can distinguish it, though I doubt whether you can."\r\nThen they went on again, and were soon at the bank from whence the\r\nsharp top of the mountain which Alice had named was visible. "And now\r\nwe are on Swindale, and in five minutes we shall get to the stone."\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes they were there; and then, but not till\r\nthen, the beauty of the little lake, lying down below them in the\r\nquiet bosom of the hills, disclosed itself. A lake should, I think,\r\nbe small, and should be seen from above, to be seen in all its glory.\r\nThe distance should be such that the shadows of the mountains on its\r\nsurface may just be traced, and that some faint idea of the ripple\r\non the waters may be present to the eye. And the form of the lakes\r\nshould be irregular, curving round from its base among the lower\r\nhills, deeper and still deeper into some close nook up among the\r\nmountains from which its head waters spring. It is thus that a lake\r\nshould be seen, and it was thus that Hawes Water was seen by them\r\nfrom the flat stone on the side of Swindale Fell. The basin of the\r\nlake has formed itself into the shape of the figure of 3, and the top\r\nsection of the figure lies embosomed among the very wildest of the\r\nWestmoreland mountains. Altogether it is not above three miles long,\r\nand every point of it was to be seen from the spot on which the girls\r\nsat themselves down. The water beneath was still as death, and as\r\ndark,--and looked almost as cold. But the slow clouds were passing\r\nover it, and the shades of darkness on its surface changed themselves\r\nwith gradual changes. And though no movement was visible, there\r\nwas ever and again in places a slight sheen upon the lake, which\r\nindicated the ripple made by the breeze.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad I\'ve come here," said Alice, seating herself. "I cannot\r\nbear the idea of coming to Vavasor without seeing one of the lakes at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get over to Windermere one day," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we shall. I don\'t think it possible that I should stay\r\nlong. Kate, I\'ve got a letter to show you." And there was that in the\r\ntone of her voice which instantly put Kate upon her mettle.\r\n\r\nKate seated herself also, and put up her hand for the letter. "Is it\r\nfrom Mr. Grey?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said Alice; "it is not from Mr. Grey." And she gave her\r\ncompanion the paper. Kate before she had touched it had seen that it\r\nwas from her brother George; and as she opened it looked anxiously\r\ninto Alice\'s face. "Has he offended you?" Kate asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swindale Fell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Read it," said Alice, "and then we\'ll talk of it afterwards,--as we\r\ngo home." Then she got up from the stone and walked a step or two\r\ntowards the brow of the fell, and stood there looking down upon the\r\nlake, while Kate read the letter. "Well!" she said, when she returned\r\nto her place.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Kate. "Alice, Alice, it will, indeed, be well if you\r\nlisten to him. Oh, Alice, may I hope? Alice, my own Alice, my\r\ndarling, my friend! Say that it shall be so." And Kate knelt at her\r\nfriend\'s feet upon the heather, and looked up into her face with eyes\r\nfull of tears. What shall we say of a woman who could be as false as\r\nshe had been, and yet could be so true?\r\n\r\nAlice made no immediate answer, but still continued to gaze down over\r\nher friend upon the lake. "Alice," continued Kate, "I did not think\r\nI should be made so happy this Christmas Day. You could not have the\r\nheart to bring me here and show me this letter in this way, and bid\r\nme read it so calmly, and then tell me that it is all for nothing.\r\nNo; you could not do that? Alice, I am so happy. I will so love this\r\nplace. I hated it before." And then she put her face down upon the\r\nboulder-stone and kissed it. Still Alice said nothing, but she began\r\nto feel that she had gone further than she had intended. It was\r\nalmost impossible for her now to say that her answer to George must\r\nbe a refusal.\r\n\r\nThen Kate again went on speaking. "But is it not a beautiful letter?\r\nSay, Alice,--is it not a letter of which if you were his brother you\r\nwould feel proud if another girl had shown it to you? I do feel proud\r\nof him. I know that he is a man with a manly heart and manly courage,\r\nwho will yet do manly things. Here out on the mountain, with nobody\r\nnear us, with Nature all round us, I ask you on your solemn word as a\r\nwoman, do you love him?"\r\n\r\n"Love him!" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--love him: as a woman should love her husband. Is not your\r\nheart his? Alice, there need be no lies now. If it be so, it should\r\nbe your glory to say so, here, to me, as you hold that letter in your\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"I can have no such glory, Kate. I have ever loved my cousin; but not\r\nso passionately as you seem to think."\r\n\r\n"Then there can be no passion in you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, Kate. I would sometimes hope that it is so. But come;\r\nwe shall be late; and you will be cold sitting there."\r\n\r\n"I would sit here all night to be sure that your answer would be as\r\nI would have it. But, Alice, at any rate you shall tell me before I\r\nmove what your answer is to be. I know you will not refuse him; but\r\nmake me happy by saying so with your own lips."\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you before you move, Kate."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have not as yet resolved."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is impossible. That is quite impossible. On such a subject\r\nand under such circumstances a woman must resolve at the first\r\nmoment. You had resolved, I know, before you had half read the\r\nletter;--though, perhaps, it may not suit you to say so."\r\n\r\n"You are quite mistaken. Come along and let us walk, and I will tell\r\nyou all." Then Kate arose, and they turned their back to the lake,\r\nand began to make their way homewards. "I have not made up my mind as\r\nto what answer I will give him; but I have shown you his letter in\r\norder that I might have some one with whom I might speak openly. I\r\nknew well how it would be, and that you would strive to hurry me into\r\nan immediate promise."\r\n\r\n"No;--no; I want nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"But yet I could not deny myself the comfort of your friendship."\r\n\r\n"No, Alice, I will not hurry you. I will do nothing that you do not\r\nwish. But you cannot be surprised that I should be very eager. Has\r\nit not been the longing of all my life? Have I not passed my time\r\nplotting and planning and thinking of it till I have had time to\r\nthink of nothing else? Do you know what I suffered when, through\r\nGeorge\'s fault, the engagement was broken off? Was it not martyrdom\r\nto me,--that horrid time in which your Crichton from Cambridgeshire\r\nwas in the ascendant? Did I not suffer the tortures of purgatory\r\nwhile that went on;--and yet, on the whole, did I not bear them with\r\npatience? And, now, can you be surprised that I am wild with joy when\r\nI begin to see that everything will be as I wish;--for it will be as\r\nI wish, Alice. It may be that you have not resolved to accept him.\r\nBut you would have resolved to refuse him instantly had that been\r\nyour destined answer to his letter." There was but little more said\r\nbetween them on the subject as they were passing over the fell, but\r\nwhen they were going down the path through the Beacon Wood, Kate\r\nagain spoke: "You will not answer him without speaking to me first?"\r\nsaid Kate.\r\n\r\n"I will, at any rate, not send my answer without telling you," said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n"And you will let me see it?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Alice; "I will not promise that. But if it is\r\nunfavourable I will show it you."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall never see it," said Kate, laughing. "But that is quite\r\nenough for me. I by no means wish to criticise the love-sweet words\r\nin which you tell him that his offences are all forgiven. I know how\r\nsweet they will be. Oh, heavens! how I envy him!"\r\n\r\nThen they were at home; and the old man met them at the front door,\r\nglowering at them angrily from out his old leonine eyes, because the\r\nroast beef was already roasted. He had his great uncouth silver watch\r\nin his hand, which was always a quarter of an hour too fast, and he\r\npointed at it fiercely, showing them the minute hand at ten minutes\r\npast the hour.\r\n\r\n"But, grandpapa, you are always too fast," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"And you are always too slow, miss," said the hungry old squire.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, it is not five yet. Is it, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"And how long are you going to be dressing?"\r\n\r\n"Not ten minutes;--are we, Alice? And, grandpapa, pray don\'t wait."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t wait! That\'s what they always say," he muttered, peevishly.\r\n"As if one would be any better waiting for them after the meat is\r\non the table." But neither Kate nor Alice heard this, as they were\r\nalready in their rooms.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said that evening between Alice and Kate about the\r\nletter; but Kate, as she wished her cousin good night inside her\r\nbedroom door, spoke to her just one word--"Pray for him to-night,"\r\nshe said, "as you pray for those you love best." Alice made no\r\nanswer, but we may believe that she did as she was desired to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nContaining an Answer to the Love Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice had had a week allowed to her to write her answer; but she\r\nsent it off before the full week was past. "Why should I keep him in\r\nsuspense?" she said. "If it is to be so, there can be no good in not\r\nsaying so at once." Then she thought, also, that if this were to be\r\nher destiny it might be well for Mr. Grey that all his doubts on the\r\nmatter should be dispelled. She had treated him badly,--very badly.\r\nShe had so injured him that the remembrance of the injury must always\r\nbe a source of misery to her; but she owed to him above everything to\r\nlet him know what were her intentions as soon as they were settled.\r\nShe tried to console herself by thinking that the wound to him would\r\nbe easy to cure. "He also is not passionate," she said. But in so\r\nsaying she deceived herself. He was a man in whom Love could be very\r\npassionate;--and was, moreover, one in whom Love could hardly be\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nEach morning Kate asked her whether her answer was written; and on\r\nthe third day after Christmas, just before dinner, Alice said that\r\nshe had written it, and that it was gone.\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t post-day," said Kate;--for the post illuminated Vavasor\r\nbut three days a week.\r\n\r\n"I have given a boy sixpence to take it to Shap," said Alice,\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n"And what have you said?" asked Kate, taking hold of the other\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"I have kept my promise," said Alice; "and do you keep yours by\r\nasking no further questions."\r\n\r\n"My sister,--my own sister," said Kate. And then, as Alice met her\r\nembrace, there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of the reply.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was of course much close discussion between them as\r\nto what other steps should now be taken. Kate wanted her cousin to\r\nwrite immediately to Mr. Grey, and was somewhat frightened when Alice\r\ndeclined to do so till she had received a further letter from George.\r\n"You have not proposed any horrid stipulations to him?" exclaimed\r\nKate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you may call horrid stipulations," said Alice,\r\ngravely. "My conditions have not been very hard, and I do not think\r\nyou would have disapproved them."\r\n\r\n"But he!--He is so impetuous! Will he disapprove them?"\r\n\r\n"I have told him-- But, Kate, this is just what I did not mean to\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"Why should there be secrets between us?" said Kate.\r\n\r\n"There shall be none, then. I have told him that I cannot bring\r\nmyself to marry him instantly;--that he must allow me twelve\r\nmonths to wear off, if I can in that time, much of sadness and of\r\nself-reproach which has fallen to my lot."\r\n\r\n"Twelve months, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Listen to me. I have said so. But I have told him also that if he\r\nwishes it still, I will at once tell papa and grandpapa that I hold\r\nmyself as engaged to him, so that he may know that I bind myself\r\nto him as far as it is possible that I should do so. And I have\r\nadded something else, Kate," she continued to say after a slight\r\npause,--"something else which I can tell you, though I could tell it\r\nto no other person. I can tell you because you would do, and will\r\ndo the same. I have told him that any portion of my money is at his\r\nservice which may be needed for his purposes before that twelve\r\nmonths is over."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Alice! No;--no. You shall not do that. It is too generous." And\r\nKate perhaps felt at the moment that her brother was a man to whom\r\nsuch an offer could hardly be made with safety.\r\n\r\n"But I have done it. Mercury, with sixpence in his pocket, is already\r\nposting my generosity at Shap. And, to tell the truth, Kate, it is\r\nno more than fair. He has honestly told me that while the old Squire\r\nlives he will want my money to assist him in a career of which I do\r\nmuch more than approve. It has been my earnest wish to see him in\r\nParliament. It will now be the most earnest desire of my heart;--the\r\none thing as to which I shall feel an intense anxiety. How then can\r\nI have the face to bid him wait twelve months for that which is\r\nspecially needed in six months\' time? It would be like the workhouses\r\nwhich are so long in giving bread, that in the mean time the wretches\r\nstarve."\r\n\r\n"But the wretch shan\'t starve," said Kate. "My money, small as it is,\r\nwill carry him over this bout. I have told him that he shall have it,\r\nand that I expect him to spend it. Moreover, I have no doubt that\r\nAunt Greenow would lend me what he wants."\r\n\r\n"But I should not wish him to borrow from Aunt Greenow. She would\r\nadvance him the money, as you say, upon stamped paper, and then talk\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"He shall have mine," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"And who are you?" said Alice, laughing. "You are not going to be his\r\nwife?"\r\n\r\n"He shall not touch your money till you are his wife," said Kate,\r\nvery seriously. "I wish you would consent to change your mind about\r\nthis stupid tedious year, and then you might do as you pleased. I\r\nhave no doubt such a settlement might be made as to the property\r\nhere, when my grandfather hears of it, as would make you ultimately\r\nsafe."\r\n\r\n"And do you think I care to be ultimately safe, as you call it? Kate,\r\nmy dear, you do not understand me."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. And yet I thought that I had known something about\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"It is because I do not care for the safety of which you speak that I\r\nam now going to become your brother\'s wife. Do you suppose that I do\r\nnot see that I must run much risk?"\r\n\r\n"You prefer the excitement of London to the tranquillity, may I say,\r\nof Cambridgeshire."\r\n\r\n"Exactly;--and therefore I have told George that he shall have my\r\nmoney whenever he wants it."\r\n\r\nKate was very persistent in her objection to this scheme till\r\nGeorge\'s answer came. His answer to Alice was accompanied by a letter\r\nto his sister, and after that Kate said nothing more about the\r\nmoney question. She said no more then; but it must not therefore be\r\nsupposed that she was less determined than she had been that no part\r\nof Alice\'s fortune should be sacrificed to her brother\'s wants;--at\r\nany rate before Alice should become her brother\'s wife. But her\r\nbrother\'s letter for the moment stopped her mouth. It would be\r\nnecessary that she should speak to him before she again spoke to\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\nIn what words Alice had written her assent it will be necessary that\r\nthe reader should know, in order that something may be understood\r\nof the struggle which she made upon the occasion; but they shall be\r\ngiven presently, when I come to speak of George Vavasor\'s position as\r\nhe received them. George\'s reply was very short and apparently very\r\nfrank. He deprecated the delay of twelve months, and still hoped to\r\nbe able to induce her to be more lenient to him. He advised her to\r\nwrite to Mr. Grey at once,--and as regarded the Squire he gave her\r\n_carte blanche_ to act as she pleased. If the Squire required any\r\nkind of apology, expression of sorrow,--and asking for pardon, or\r\nsuch like, he, George, would, under the circumstances as they now\r\nexisted, comply with the requisition most willingly. He would regard\r\nit as a simple form, made necessary by his coming marriage. As to\r\nAlice\'s money, he thanked her heartily for her confidence. If the\r\nnature of his coming contest at Chelsea should make it necessary,\r\nhe would use her offer as frankly as it had been made. Such was his\r\nletter to Alice. What was contained in his letter to Kate, Alice\r\nnever knew.\r\n\r\nThen came the business of telling this new love tale,--the\r\nthird which poor Alice had been forced to tell her father and\r\ngrandfather;--and a grievous task it was. In this matter she feared\r\nher father much more than her grandfather, and therefore she resolved\r\nto tell her grandfather first;--or, rather, she determined that she\r\nwould tell the Squire, and that in the mean time Kate should talk to\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n"Grandpapa," she said to him the morning after she had received her\r\ncousin\'s second letter.--The old man was in the habit of breakfasting\r\nalone in a closet of his own, which was called his dressing-room,\r\nbut in which he kept no appurtenances for dressing, but in lieu of\r\nthem a large collection of old spuds and sticks and horse\'s-bits.\r\nThere was a broken spade here, and a hoe or two; and a small table\r\nin the corner was covered with the debris of tradesmen\'s bills\r\nfrom Penrith, and dirty scraps which he was wont to call his farm\r\naccounts.--"Grandpapa," said Alice, rushing away at once into the\r\nmiddle of her subject, "you told me the other day that you thought\r\nI ought to be--married."\r\n\r\n"Did I, my dear? Well, yes; so I did. And so you ought;--I mean to\r\nthat Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"That is impossible, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the use of your coming and talking to me about it?"\r\n\r\nThis made Alice\'s task not very easy; but, nevertheless, she\r\npersevered. "I am come, grandpapa, to tell you of another\r\nengagement."\r\n\r\n"Another!" said he. And by the tone of his voice he accused his\r\ngranddaughter of having a larger number of favoured suitors than\r\nought to fall to the lot of any young lady. It was very hard upon\r\nher, but still she went on.\r\n\r\n"You know," said she, "that some years ago I was to have been married\r\nto my cousin George;"--and then she paused.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"And I remember you told me then that you were much pleased."\r\n\r\n"So I was. George was doing well then; or,--which is more\r\nlikely,--had made us believe that he was doing well. Have you made it\r\nup with him again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s the meaning of your jilting Mr. Grey, is it?"\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! It is hard to explain how heavy a blow fell upon\r\nher from the open utterance of that word! Of all words in the\r\nlanguage it was the one which she now most dreaded. She had called\r\nherself a jilt, with that inaudible voice which one uses in making\r\nself-accusations;--but hitherto no lips had pronounced the odious\r\nword to her ears. Poor Alice! She was a jilt; and perhaps it may have\r\nbeen well that the old man should tell her so.\r\n\r\n"Grandpapa!" she said; and there was that in the tone of her voice\r\nwhich somewhat softened the Squire\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, I don\'t want to be ill-natured. So you are going at\r\nlast to marry George, are you? I hope he\'ll treat you well; that\'s\r\nall. Does your father approve of it?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you first, sir;--because I wish to obtain your consent\r\nto seeing George again here as your grandson."\r\n\r\n"Never," said the old man, snarling;--"never!"\r\n\r\n"If he has been wrong, he will beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"If he has been wrong! Didn\'t he want to squander every shilling of\r\nthe property,--property which has never belonged to him;--property\r\nwhich I could give to Tom, Dick, or Harry to-morrow, if I liked?--If\r\nhe has been wrong!"\r\n\r\n"I am not defending him, sir;--but I thought that, perhaps, on such\r\nan occasion as this--"\r\n\r\n"A Tom Fool\'s occasion! You\'ve got money of your own. He\'ll spend all\r\nthat now."\r\n\r\n"He will be less likely to do so if you will recognise him as your\r\nheir. Pray believe, sir, that he is not the sort of man that he was."\r\n\r\n"He must be a very clever sort of man, I think, when he has talked\r\nyou out of such a husband as John Grey. It\'s astounding to me,--with\r\nthat ugly mug of his! Well, my dear, if your father approves of it,\r\nand if George will ask my pardon,--but I don\'t think he ever will--"\r\n\r\n"He will, sir. I am his messenger for as much as that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are, are you? Then you may also be my messenger to him, and\r\ntell him that, for your sake, I will let him come back here. I know\r\nhe\'ll insult me the first day; but I\'ll try and put up with it,--for\r\nyour sake, my dear. Of course I must know what your father thinks\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that Kate\'s success was even less than that which\r\nAlice achieved. "I knew it would be so," said John Vavasor, when his\r\nniece first told him;--and as he spoke he struck his hand upon the\r\ntable. "I knew all along how it would be."\r\n\r\n"And why should it not be so, Uncle John?"\r\n\r\n"He is your brother, and I will not tell you why."\r\n\r\n"You think that he is a spendthrift?"\r\n\r\n"I think that he is as unsafe a man as ever I knew to be intrusted\r\nwith the happiness of any young woman. That is all."\r\n\r\n"You are hard upon him, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so. Tell Alice this from me,--that as I have never yet been\r\nable to get her to think anything of my opinion, I do not at all\r\nexpect that I shall be able to induce her to do so now. I will not\r\neven make the attempt. As my son-in-law I will not receive George\r\nVavasor. Tell Alice that."\r\n\r\nAlice was told her father\'s message; but Kate in telling it felt no\r\ndeep regret. She well knew that Alice would not be turned back from\r\nher present intention by her father\'s wishes. Nor would it have\r\nbeen very reasonable that she should. Her father had for many years\r\nrelieved himself from the burden of a father\'s cares, and now had\r\nhardly the right to claim a father\'s privileges.\r\n\r\nWe will now go once again to George Vavasor\'s room in Cecil Street,\r\nin which he received Alice\'s letter. He was dressing when it was\r\nfirst brought to him; and when he recognised the handwriting he put\r\nit down on his toilet table unopened. He put it down, and went on\r\nbrushing his hair, as though he were determined to prove to himself\r\nthat he was indifferent as to the tidings which it might contain.\r\nHe went on brushing his hair, and cleaning his teeth, and tying his\r\ncravat carefully over his turned-down collar, while the unopened\r\nletter lay close to his hand. Of course he was thinking of it,--of\r\ncourse he was anxious,--of course his eye went to it from moment\r\nto moment. But he carried it with him into the sitting-room still\r\nunopened, and so it remained until after the girl had brought him his\r\ntea and his toast. "And now," said he, as he threw himself into his\r\narm-chair, "let us see what the girl of my heart says to me." The\r\ngirl of his heart said to him as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR GEORGE,\r\n\r\n   I feel great difficulty in answering your letter. Could I\r\n   have my own way, I should make no answer to it at present,\r\n   but leave it for the next six months, so that then such\r\n   answer might hereafter be made as circumstances should\r\n   seem to require. This will be little flattering to you,\r\n   but it is less flattering to myself. Whatever answer I may\r\n   make, how can anything in this affair be flattering either\r\n   to you or to me? We have been like children who have\r\n   quarrelled over our game of play, till now, at the close\r\n   of our little day of pleasure, we are fain to meet each\r\n   other in tears, and acknowledge that we have looked for\r\n   delights where no delights were to be found.\r\n\r\n   Kate, who is here, talks to me of passionate love. There\r\n   is no such passion left to me;--nor, as I think, to you\r\n   either. It would not now be possible that you and I should\r\n   come together on such terms as that. We could not stand\r\n   up together as man and wife with any hope of a happy\r\n   marriage, unless we had both agreed that such happiness\r\n   might be had without passionate love.\r\n\r\n   You will see from all this that I do not refuse your\r\n   offer. Without passion, I have for you a warm affection,\r\n   which enables me to take a livelier interest in your\r\n   career than in any other of the matters which are around\r\n   me. Of course, if I become your wife that interest will be\r\n   still closer and dearer, and I do feel that I can take in\r\n   it that concern which a wife should have in her husband\'s\r\n   affairs.\r\n\r\n   If it suits you, I will become your wife;--but it cannot\r\n   be quite at once. I have suffered much from the past\r\n   conflicts of my life, and there has been very much with\r\n   which I must reproach myself. I know that I have behaved\r\n   badly. Sometimes I have to undergo the doubly bitter\r\n   self-accusation of having behaved in a manner which the\r\n   world will call unfeminine. You must understand that I\r\n   have not passed through this unscathed, and I must beg\r\n   you to allow me some time for a cure. A perfect cure I\r\n   may never expect, but I think that in twelve months from\r\n   this time I may so far have recovered my usual spirit and\r\n   ease of mind as to enable me to devote myself to your\r\n   happiness. Dear George, if you will accept me under such\r\n   circumstances, I will be your wife, and will endeavour to\r\n   do my duty by you faithfully.\r\n\r\n   I have said that even now, as your cousin, I take a lively\r\n   interest in your career,--of course I mean your career as\r\n   a politician,--and especially in your hopes of entering\r\n   Parliament. I understand, accurately as I think, what you\r\n   have said about my fortune, and I perfectly appreciate\r\n   your truth and frankness. If I had nothing of my own you,\r\n   in your circumstances, could not possibly take me as your\r\n   wife. I know, moreover, that your need of assistance from\r\n   my means is immediate rather than prospective. My money\r\n   may be absolutely necessary to you within this year,\r\n   during which, as I tell you most truly, I cannot bring\r\n   myself to become a married woman. But my money shall\r\n   be less cross-grained than myself. You will take it as\r\n   frankly as I mean it when I say, that whatever you want\r\n   for your political purposes shall be forthcoming at your\r\n   slightest wish. Dear George, let me have the honour and\r\n   glory of marrying a man who has gained a seat in the\r\n   Parliament of Great Britain! Of all positions which a man\r\n   may attain that, to me, is the grandest.\r\n\r\n   I shall wait for a further letter from you before I speak\r\n   either to my father or to my grandfather. If you can tell\r\n   me that you accede to my views, I will at once try to\r\n   bring about a reconciliation between you and the Squire.\r\n   I think that that will be almost easier than inducing my\r\n   father to look with favour upon our marriage. But I need\r\n   hardly say that should either one or the other oppose\r\n   it,--or should both do so,--that would not turn me from my\r\n   purpose.\r\n\r\n   I also wait for your answer to write a last line to Mr.\r\n   Grey.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n   ALICE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor when he had read the letter threw it carelessly from\r\nhim on to the breakfast table, and began to munch his toast. He threw\r\nit carelessly from him, as though taking a certain pride in his\r\ncarelessness. "Very well," said he; "so be it. It is probably the\r\nbest thing that I could do, whatever the effect may be on her." Then\r\nhe took up his newspaper. But before the day was over he had made\r\nmany plans,--plans made almost unconsciously,--as to the benefit\r\nwhich might accrue to him from the offer which she had made of her\r\nmoney. And before night he had written that reply to her of which we\r\nhave heard the contents; and had written also to his sister Kate a\r\nletter, of which Kate had kept the contents to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMonkshade.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first of the new year came round Lady Glencora was not\r\nkeeping her appointment at Lady Monk\'s house. She went to Gatherum\r\nCastle, and let us hope that she enjoyed the magnificent Christmas\r\nhospitality of the Duke; but when the time came for moving on to\r\nMonkshade, she was indisposed, and Mr. Palliser went thither alone.\r\nLady Glencora returned to Matching and remained at home, while her\r\nhusband was away, in company with the two Miss Pallisers.\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings reached Monkshade that Lady Glencora was not to\r\nbe expected, Burgo Fitzgerald was already there, armed with such\r\npecuniary assistance as George Vavasor had been able to wrench out\r\nof the hands of Mr. Magruin. "Burgo," said his aunt, catching him one\r\nmorning near his bedroom door as he was about to go down-stairs in\r\nhunting trim, "Burgo, your old flame, Lady Glencora, is not coming\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora not coming!" said Burgo, betraying by his look and the\r\ntone of his voice too clearly that this change in the purpose of a\r\nmarried lady was to him of more importance than it should have been.\r\nSuch betrayal, however, to Lady Monk was not perhaps matter of much\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"No; she is not coming. It can\'t be matter of any moment to you now."\r\n\r\n"But, by heavens, it is," said he, putting his hand up to his\r\nforehead, and leaning back against the wall of the passage as though\r\nin despair. "It is matter of moment to me. I am the most unfortunate\r\ndevil that ever lived."\r\n\r\n"Fie, Burgo, fie! You must not speak in that way of a married woman.\r\nI begin to think it is better that she should not come." At this\r\nmoment another man booted and spurred came down the passage, upon\r\nwhom Lady Monk smiled sweetly, speaking some pretty little word as\r\nhe passed. Burgo spoke never a word, but still stood leaning against\r\nthe wall, with his hand to his forehead, showing that he had heard\r\nsomething which had moved him greatly. "Come back into your room,\r\nBurgo," said his aunt; and they both went in at the door that was\r\nnearest to them, for Lady Monk had been on the look-out for him, and\r\nhad caught him as soon as he appeared in the passage. "If this does\r\nannoy you, you should keep it to yourself! What will people say?"\r\n\r\n"How can I help what they say?"\r\n\r\n"But you would not wish to injure her, I suppose? I thought it best\r\nto tell you, for fear you should show any special sign of surprise\r\nif you heard of it first in public. It is very weak in you to allow\r\nyourself to feel that sort of regard for a married woman. If you\r\ncannot constrain yourself I shall be afraid to let you meet her in\r\nBrook Street."\r\n\r\nBurgo looked for a moment into his aunt\'s face without answering her,\r\nand then turned away towards the door. "You can do as you please\r\nabout that," said he; "but you know as well as I do what I have made\r\nup my mind to do."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Burgo; I know nothing of the kind. But do you go\r\ndown-stairs to breakfast, and don\'t look like that when you go among\r\nthe people there."\r\n\r\nLady Monk was a woman now about fifty years of age, who had been a\r\ngreat beauty, and who was still handsome in her advanced age. Her\r\nfigure was very good. She was tall and of fine proportion, though by\r\nno means verging to that state of body which our excellent American\r\nfriend and critic Mr. Hawthorne has described as beefy and has\r\ndeclared to be the general condition of English ladies of Lady Monk\'s\r\nage. Lady Monk was not beefy. She was a comely, handsome, upright,\r\ndame,--one of whom, as regards her outward appearance, England might\r\nbe proud,--and of whom Sir Cosmo Monk was very proud. She had come of\r\nthe family of the Worcestershire Fitzgeralds, of whom it used to be\r\nsaid that there never was one who was not beautiful and worthless.\r\nLooking at Lady Monk you would hardly think that she could be a\r\nworthless woman; but there were one or two who professed to know her,\r\nand who declared that she was a true scion of the family to which she\r\nbelonged;--that even her husband\'s ample fortune had suffered from\r\nher extravagance, that she had quarrelled with her only son, and\r\nhad succeeded in marrying her daughter to the greatest fool in the\r\npeerage. She had striven very hard to bring about a marriage between\r\nher nephew and the great heiress, and was a woman not likely to\r\npardon those who had foiled her.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Burgo felt very certain that his aunt was aware of his\r\npurpose, and could not forgive her for pretending to be innocent of\r\nit. In this he was most ungrateful, as well as unreasonable,--and\r\nvery indiscreet also. Had he been a man who ever reflected he must\r\nhave known that such a woman as his aunt could only assist him as\r\nlong as she might be presumed to be ignorant of his intention. But\r\nBurgo never reflected. The Fitzgeralds never reflected till they were\r\nnearer forty than thirty, and then people began to think worse of\r\nthem than they had thought before.\r\n\r\nWhen Burgo reached the dining-room there were many men there, but no\r\nladies. Sir Cosmo Monk, a fine bald-headed hale man of about sixty,\r\nwas standing up at the sideboard, cutting a huge game pie. He was a\r\nman also who did not reflect much, but who contrived to keep straight\r\nin his course through the world without much reflection. "Palliser\r\nis coming without her," he said in his loud clear voice, thinking\r\nnothing of his wife\'s nephew. "She\'s ill, she says."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for it," said one man. "She\'s a deal the better fellow of\r\nthe two."\r\n\r\n"She has twice more go in her than Planty Pall," said another.\r\n\r\n"Planty is no fool, I can tell you," said Sir Cosmo, coming to the\r\ntable with his plate full of pie. "We think he\'s about the most\r\nrising man we have." Sir Cosmo was the member for his county, and\r\nwas a Liberal. He had once, when a much younger man, been at the\r\nTreasury, and had since always spoken of the Whig Government as\r\nthough he himself were in some sort a part of it.\r\n\r\n"Burgo, do you hear that Palliser is coming without his wife?"\r\nsaid one man,--a very young man, who hardly knew what had been the\r\ncircumstances of the case. The others, when they saw Burgo enter, had\r\nbeen silent on the subject of Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I have heard,--and be d----d to him," said Burgo. Then there was\r\nsuddenly a silence in the room, and everyone seemed to attend\r\nassiduously to his breakfast. It was very terrible, this clear\r\nexpression of a guilty meaning with reference to the wife of another\r\nman! Burgo regarded neither his plate nor his cup, but thrusting\r\nhis hands into his breeches pockets, sat back in his chair with the\r\nblackness as of a thunder cloud upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I have heard," said Burgo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Burgo, you had better eat your breakfast," said Sir Cosmo.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any breakfast." He took, however, a bit of toast,\r\nand crumbling it up in his hand as he put a morsel into his mouth,\r\nwent away to the sideboard and filled for himself a glass of cherry\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t eat any breakfast the less of that you take the\r\nbetter," said Sir Cosmo.\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right now," said he, and coming back to the table, went\r\nthrough some form of making a meal with a roll and a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThey who were then present used afterwards to say that they should\r\nnever forget that breakfast. There had been something, they declared,\r\nin the tone of Burgo\'s voice when he uttered his curse against Mr.\r\nPalliser, which had struck them all with dread. There had, too, they\r\nsaid, been a blackness in his face, so terrible to be seen, that it\r\nhad taken from them all the power of conversation. Sir Cosmo, when he\r\nhad broken the ominous silence, had done so with a manifest struggle.\r\nThe loud clatter of glasses with which Burgo had swallowed his dram,\r\nas though resolved to show that he was regardless who might know that\r\nhe was drinking, added to the feeling. It may easily be understood\r\nthat there was no further word spoken at that breakfast-table about\r\nPlanty Pall or his wife.\r\n\r\nOn that day Burgo Fitzgerald startled all those who saw him by the\r\nmad way in which he rode. Early in the day there was no excuse for\r\nany such rashness. The hounds went from wood to wood, and men went in\r\ntroops along the forest sides as they do on such occasions. But Burgo\r\nwas seen to cram his horse at impracticable places, and to ride at\r\ngates and rails as though resolved to do himself and his uncle\'s\r\nsteed a mischief. This was so apparent that some friend spoke to Sir\r\nCosmo Monk about it. "I can do nothing," said Sir Cosmo. "He is a\r\nman whom no one\'s words will control. Something has ruffled him this\r\nmorning, and he must run his chance till he becomes quiet." In the\r\nafternoon there was a good run, and Burgo again rode as hard as he\r\ncould make his horse carry him;--but then there was the usual excuse\r\nfor hard riding; and such riding in a straight run is not dangerous,\r\nas it is when the circumstances of the occasion do not warrant it,\r\nBut, be that as it may, Burgo went on to the end of the day without\r\naccident, and as he went home, assured Sir Cosmo, in a voice which\r\nwas almost cheery, that his mare Spinster was by far the best thing\r\nin the Monkshade stables. Indeed Spinster made quite a character that\r\nday, and was sold at the end of the season for three hundred guineas\r\non the strength of it. I am, however, inclined to believe that there\r\nwas nothing particular about the mare. Horses always catch the\r\ntemperament of their riders, and when a man wishes to break his neck,\r\nhe will generally find a horse willing to assist him in appearance,\r\nbut able to save him in the performance. Burgo, at any rate, did not\r\nbreak his neck, and appeared at the dinner-table in a better humour\r\nthan that which he had displayed in the morning.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed Mr. Palliser reached Monkshade. He was, in a\r\nmanner, canvassing for the support of the Liberal party, and it would\r\nnot have suited him to show any indifference to the invitation of\r\nso influential a man as Sir Cosmo. Sir Cosmo had a little party of\r\nhis own in the House, consisting of four or five other respectable\r\ncountry gentlemen, who troubled themselves little with thinking, and\r\nwho mostly had bald heads. Sir Cosmo was a man with whom it was quite\r\nnecessary that such an aspirant as Mr. Palliser should stand well, and\r\ntherefore Mr. Palliser came to Monkshade, although Lady Glencora was\r\nunable to accompany him.\r\n\r\n"We are so sorry," said Lady Monk. "We have been looking forward to\r\nhaving Lady Glencora with us beyond everything."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser declared that Lady Glencora herself was overwhelmed with\r\ngrief in that she should have been debarred from making this special\r\nvisit. She had, however, been so unwell at Gatherum, the anxious\r\nhusband declared, as to make it unsafe for her to go again away from\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"I hope it is nothing serious," said Lady Monk, with a look of grief\r\nso well arranged that any stranger would have thought that all the\r\nPallisers must have been very dear to her heart. Then Mr. Palliser\r\nwent on to explain that Lady Glencora had unfortunately been foolish.\r\nDuring one of those nights of hard frost she had gone out among the\r\nruins at Matching, to show them by moonlight to a friend. The friend\r\nhad thoughtlessly, foolishly, and in a manner which Mr. Palliser\r\ndeclared to be very reprehensible, allowed Lady Glencora to remain\r\namong the ruins till she had caught cold.\r\n\r\n"How very wrong!" said Lady Monk with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\n"It was very wrong," said Mr. Palliser, speaking of poor Alice almost\r\nmaliciously. "However, she caught a cold which, unfortunately, has\r\nbecome worse at my uncle\'s, and so I was obliged to take her home."\r\n\r\nLady Monk perceived that Mr. Palliser had in truth left his wife\r\nbehind because he believed her to be ill, and not because he was\r\nafraid of Burgo Fitzgerald. So accomplished a woman as Lady Monk felt\r\nno doubt that the wife\'s absence was caused by fear of the lover, and\r\nnot by any cold caught in viewing ruins by moonlight. She was not to\r\nbe deceived in such a matter. But she became aware that Mr. Palliser\r\nhad been deceived. As she was right in this we must go back for a\r\nmoment, and say a word of things as they went on at Matching after\r\nAlice Vavasor had left that place.\r\n\r\nAlice had told Miss Palliser that steps ought to be taken, whatever\r\nmight be their cost, to save Lady Glencora from the peril of a visit\r\nto Monkshade. To this Miss Palliser had assented, and, when she left\r\nAlice, was determined to tell Mr. Palliser the whole story. But when\r\nthe time for doing so had come, her courage failed her. She could not\r\nfind words in which to warn the husband that his wife would not be\r\nsafe in the company of her old lover. The task with Lady Glencora\r\nherself, bad as that would be, might be easier, and this task she at\r\nlast undertook,--not without success.\r\n\r\n"Glencora," she said, when she found a fitting opportunity, "you\r\nwon\'t be angry, I hope, if I say a word to you?"\r\n\r\n"That depends very much upon what the word is," said Lady Glencora.\r\nAnd here it must be acknowledged that Mr. Palliser\'s wife had not done\r\nmuch to ingratiate herself with Mr. Palliser\'s cousins;--not perhaps\r\nso much as she should have done, seeing that she found them in her\r\nhusband\'s house. She had taught herself to think that they were hard,\r\nstiff, and too proud of bearing the name of Palliser. Perhaps some\r\nlittle attempt may have been made by one or both of them to teach her\r\nsomething, and it need hardly be said that such an attempt on the\r\npart of a husband\'s unmarried female relations would not be forgiven\r\nby a young bride. She had undoubtedly been ungracious, and of this\r\nMiss Palliser was well aware.\r\n\r\n"Well,--the word shall be as little unpleasant as I can make it,"\r\nsaid Miss Palliser, already appreciating fully the difficulty of her\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n"But why say anything that is unpleasant? However, if it is to be\r\nsaid, let us have it over at once."\r\n\r\n"You are going to Monkshade, I believe, with Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"Well;--and what of that?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Glencora, I think you had better not go. Do you not think so\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"Who has been talking to you?" said Lady Glencora, turning upon her\r\nvery sharply.\r\n\r\n"Nobody has been talking to me;--not in the sense you mean."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet has spoken to you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word," said Miss Palliser. "You may be sure that he would not\r\nutter a word on such a subject to anyone unless it were to yourself.\r\nBut, dear Glencora, you should not go there;--I mean it in all\r\nkindness and love,--I do indeed." Saying this she offered her hand to\r\nGlencora, and Glencora took it.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you do," said she in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do. The world is so hard and cruel in what it says."\r\n\r\n"I do not care two straws for what the world says."\r\n\r\n"But he might care."\r\n\r\n"It is not my fault. I do not want to go to Monkshade. Lady Monk was\r\nmy friend once, but I do not care if I never see her again. I did not\r\narrange this visit. It was Plantagenet who did it."\r\n\r\n"But he will not take you there if you say you do not wish it."\r\n\r\n"I have said so, and he told me that I must go. You will hardly\r\nbelieve me,--but I condescended even to tell him why I thought it\r\nbetter to remain away. He told me, in answer, that it was a silly\r\nfolly which I must live down, and that it did not become me to be\r\nafraid of any man."\r\n\r\n"Of course you are not afraid, but--"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid. That is just the truth. I am afraid;--but what can I do\r\nmore than I have done?"\r\n\r\nThis was very terrible to Miss Palliser. She had not thought that\r\nLady Glencora would say so much, and she felt a true regret in having\r\nbeen made to hear words which so nearly amounted to a confession.\r\nBut for this there was no help now. There were not many more words\r\nbetween them, and we already know the result of the conversation.\r\nLady Glencora became so ill from the effects of her imprudent\r\nlingering among the ruins that she was unable to go to Monkshade.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser remained three days at Monkshade, and cemented his\r\npolitical alliance with Sir Cosmo much in the same way as he had\r\nbefore done with the Duke of St. Bungay. There was little or nothing\r\nsaid about politics, and certainly not a word that could be taken as\r\nany definite party understanding between the men; but they sat at\r\ndinner together at the same table, drank a glass of wine or two out\r\nof the same decanters, and dropped a chance word now and again about\r\nthe next session of Parliament. I do not know that anything more had\r\nbeen expected either by Mr. Palliser or by Sir Cosmo; but it seemed\r\nto be understood when Mr. Palliser went away that Sir Cosmo was of\r\nopinion that that young scion of a ducal house ought to become the\r\nfuture Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Whig Government.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see that there\'s so much in him," said one young member of\r\nParliament to Sir Cosmo.\r\n\r\n"I rather think that there is, all the same," said the baronet.\r\n"There\'s a good deal in him, I believe! I dare say he\'s not very\r\nbright, but I don\'t know that we want brightness. A bright financier\r\nis the most dangerous man in the world. We\'ve had enough of that\r\nalready. Give me sound common sense, with just enough of the gab in\r\na man to enable him to say what he\'s got to say! We don\'t want more\r\nthan that nowadays." From which it became evident that Sir Cosmo was\r\nsatisfied with the new political candidate for high place.\r\n\r\nLady Monk took an occasion to introduce Mr. Palliser to Burgo\r\nFitzgerald; with what object it is difficult to say, unless she was\r\nanxious to make mischief between the men. Burgo scowled at him; but\r\nMr. Palliser did not notice the scowl, and put out his hand to his\r\nlate rival most affably. Burgo was forced to take it, and as he did\r\nso made a little speech. "I\'m sorry that we have not the pleasure of\r\nseeing Lady Glencora with you," said he.\r\n\r\n"She is unfortunately indisposed," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for it," said Burgo--"very sorry indeed." Then he turned\r\nhis back and walked away. The few words he had spoken, and the manner\r\nin which he had carried himself, had been such as to make all those\r\naround them notice it. Each of them knew that Lady Glencora\'s name\r\nshould not have been in Burgo\'s mouth, and all felt a fear not\r\neasily to be defined that something terrible would come of it. But\r\nMr. Palliser himself did not seem to notice anything, or to fear\r\nanything; and nothing terrible did come of it during that visit of\r\nhis to Monkshade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor Speaks to His Daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor returned to London with her father, leaving Kate at\r\nVavasor Hall with her grandfather. The journey was not a pleasant\r\none. Mr. Vavasor knew that it was his duty to do something,--to\r\ntake some steps with the view of preventing the marriage which his\r\ndaughter meditated; but he did not know what that something should\r\nbe, and he did know that, whatever it might be, the doing of it\r\nwould be thoroughly disagreeable. When they started from Vavasor he\r\nhad as yet hardly spoken to her a word upon the subject. "I cannot\r\ncongratulate you," he had simply said. "I hope the time may come,\r\npapa, when you will," Alice had answered; and that had been all.\r\n\r\nThe squire had promised that he would consent to a reconciliation\r\nwith his grandson, if Alice\'s father would express himself satisfied\r\nwith the proposed marriage. John Vavasor had certainly expressed\r\nnothing of the kind. "I think so badly of him," he had said, speaking\r\nto the old man of George, "that I would rather know that almost any\r\nother calamity was to befall her, than that she should be united\r\nto him." Then the squire, with his usual obstinacy, had taken up\r\nthe cudgels on behalf of his grandson; and had tried to prove that\r\nthe match after all would not be so bad in its results as his son\r\nseemed to expect. "It would do very well for the property," he said.\r\n"I would settle the estate on their eldest son, so that he could\r\nnot touch it; and I don\'t see why he shouldn\'t reform as well as\r\nanother." John Vavasor had then declared that George was thoroughly\r\nbad, that he was an adventurer; that he believed him to be a ruined\r\nman, and that he would never reform. The squire upon this had waxed\r\nangry, and in this way George obtained aid and assistance down at\r\nthe old house, which he certainly had no right to expect. When Alice\r\nwished her grandfather good-bye the old man gave her a message to his\r\ngrandson. "You may tell him," said he, "that I will never see him\r\nagain unless he begs my pardon for his personal bad conduct to me,\r\nbut that if he marries you, I will take care that the property is\r\nproperly settled upon his child and yours. I shall always be glad to\r\nsee you, my dear; and for your sake, I will see him if he will humble\r\nhimself to me." There was no word spoken then about her father\'s\r\nconsent; and Alice, when she left Vavasor, felt that the squire was\r\nrather her friend than her enemy in regard to this thing which she\r\ncontemplated. That her father was and would be an uncompromising\r\nenemy to her,--uncompromising though probably not energetical,--she\r\nwas well aware; and, therefore, the journey up to London was not\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAlice had resolved, with great pain to herself, that in this matter\r\nshe owed her father no obedience. "There cannot be obedience on one\r\nside," she said to herself, "without protection and support on the\r\nother." Now it was quite true that John Vavasor had done little in\r\nthe way of supporting or protecting his daughter. Early in life,\r\nbefore she had resided under the same roof with him in London, he\r\nhad, as it were, washed his hands of all solicitude regarding her;\r\nand having no other ties of family, had fallen into habits of life\r\nwhich made it almost impossible for him to live with her as any other\r\nfather would live with his child. Then, when there first sprang\r\nup between them that manner of sharing the same house without any\r\njoining together of their habits of life, he had excused himself\r\nto himself by saying that Alice was unlike other girls, and that\r\nshe required no protection. Her fortune was her own, and at her own\r\ndisposal. Her character was such that she showed no inclination to\r\nthrow the burden of such disposal on her father\'s shoulders. She was\r\nsteady, too, and given to no pursuits which made it necessary that he\r\nshould watch closely over her. She was a girl, he thought, who could\r\ndo as well without surveillance as with it,--as well, or perhaps\r\nbetter. So it had come to pass that Alice had been the free mistress\r\nof her own actions, and had been left to make the most she could of\r\nher own hours. It cannot be supposed that she had eaten her lonely\r\ndinners in Queen Anne Street night after night, week after week,\r\nmonth after month, without telling herself that her father was\r\nneglecting her. She could not perceive that he spent every evening in\r\nsociety, but never an evening in her society, without feeling that\r\nthe tie between her and him was not the strong bond which usually\r\nbinds a father to his child. She was well aware that she had been\r\nill-used in being thus left desolate in her home. She had uttered no\r\nword of complaint; but she had learned, without being aware that she\r\nwas doing so, to entertain a firm resolve that her father should not\r\nguide her in her path through life. In that affair of John Grey they\r\nhad both for a time thought alike, and Mr. Vavasor had believed that\r\nhis theory with reference to Alice had been quite correct. She had\r\nbeen left to herself, and was going to dispose of herself in a way\r\nthan which nothing could be more eligible. But evil days were now\r\ncoming, and Mr. Vavasor, as he travelled up to London, with his\r\ndaughter seated opposite to him in the railway carriage, felt that\r\nnow, at last, he must interfere. In part of the journey they had the\r\ncarriage to themselves, and Mr. Vavasor thought that he would begin\r\nwhat he had to say; but he put it off till others joined them, and\r\nthen there was no further opportunity for such conversation as that\r\nwhich would be necessary between them. They reached home about\r\neight in the evening, having dined on the road. "She will be tired\r\nto-night," he said to himself, as he went off to his club, "and I\r\nwill speak to her to-morrow." Alice specially felt his going on this\r\nevening. When two persons had together the tedium of such a journey\r\nas that from Westmoreland up to London, there should be some feeling\r\nbetween them to bind them together while enjoying the comfort of the\r\nevening. Had he stayed and sat with her at her tea-table, Alice would\r\nat any rate have endeavoured to be soft with him in any discussion\r\nthat might have been raised; but he went away from her at once,\r\nleaving her to think alone over the perils of the life before her. "I\r\nwant to speak to you after breakfast to-morrow," he said as he went\r\nout. Alice answered that she should be there,--as a matter of course.\r\nShe scorned to tell him that she was always there,--always alone at\r\nhome. She had never uttered a word of complaint, and she would not\r\nbegin now.\r\n\r\nThe discussion after breakfast the next day was commenced with\r\nformal and almost ceremonial preparation. The father and daughter\r\nbreakfasted together, with the knowledge that the discussion was\r\ncoming. It did not give to either of them a good appetite, and very\r\nlittle was said at table.\r\n\r\n"Will you come up-stairs?" said Alice, when she perceived that her\r\nfather had finished his tea.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that will be best," said he. Then he followed her into the\r\ndrawing-room in which the fire had just been lit.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said he, "I must speak to you about this engagement of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you sit down, papa? It does look so dreadful, your standing up\r\nover one in that way." He had placed himself on the rug with his back\r\nto the incipient fire, but now, at her request, he sat himself down\r\nopposite to her.\r\n\r\n"I was greatly grieved when I heard of this at Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you should be grieved, papa."\r\n\r\n"I was grieved. I must confess that I never could understand why you\r\ntreated Mr. Grey as you have done."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, that\'s done and past. Pray let that be among the bygones."\r\n\r\n"Does he know yet of your engagement with your cousin?"\r\n\r\n"He will know it by this time to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Then I beg of you, as a great favour, to postpone your letter to\r\nhim." To this Alice made no answer. "I have not troubled you with\r\nmany such requests, Alice. Will you tell me that this one shall be\r\ngranted?"\r\n\r\n"I think that I owe it to him as an imperative duty to let him know\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"But you may change your mind again." Alice found that this was\r\nhard to bear and hard to answer; but there was a certain amount of\r\ntruth in the grievous reproach conveyed in her father\'s words, which\r\nmade her bow her neck to it. "I have no right to say that it is\r\nimpossible," she replied, in words that were barely audible.\r\n\r\n"No;--exactly so," said her father. "And therefore it will be better\r\nthat you should postpone any such communication."\r\n\r\n"For how long do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Till you and I shall have agreed together that he should be told."\r\n\r\n"No, papa; I will not consent to that. I consider myself bound to let\r\nhim know the truth without delay. I have done him a great injury, and\r\nI must put an end to that as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"You have done him an injury certainly, my dear;--a very great\r\ninjury," said Mr. Vavasor, going away from his object about the\r\nproposed letter; "and I believe he will feel it as such to the last\r\nday of his life, if this goes on."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. I believe that it will not be so. I feel sure that it\r\nwill not be so."\r\n\r\n"But of course what I am thinking of now is your welfare,--not his.\r\nWhen you simply told me that you intended to--." Alice winced,\r\nfor she feared to hear from her father that odious word which her\r\ngrandfather had used to her; and indeed the word had been on her\r\nfather\'s lips, but he had refrained and spared her--"that you\r\nintended to break your engagement with Mr. Grey," he continued, "I\r\nsaid little or nothing to you. I would not ask you to marry any man,\r\neven though you had yourself promised to marry him. But when you\r\ntell me that you are engaged to your cousin George, the matter is\r\nvery different. I do not think well of your cousin. Indeed I think\r\nanything but well of him. It is my duty to tell you that the world\r\nspeaks very ill of him." He paused, but Alice remained silent. "When\r\nyou were about to travel with him," he continued, "I ought perhaps to\r\nhave told you the same. But I did not wish to pain you or his sister;\r\nand, moreover, I have heard worse of him since then,--much worse than\r\nI had heard before."\r\n\r\n"As you did not tell me before, I think you might spare me now," said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself without\r\ntelling you that you are doing so. If it were not for your money he\r\nwould never think of marrying you."\r\n\r\n"Of that I am well aware," said Alice. "He has told me so himself\r\nvery plainly."\r\n\r\n"And yet you will marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will. It seems to me, papa, that there is a great deal\r\nof false feeling about this matter of money in marriage,--or rather,\r\nperhaps, a great deal of pretended feeling. Why should I be angry\r\nwith a man for wishing to get that for which every man is struggling?\r\nAt this point of George\'s career the use of money is essential to\r\nhim. He could not marry without it."\r\n\r\n"You had better then give him your money without yourself," said her\r\nfather, speaking in irony.\r\n\r\n"That is just what I mean to do, papa," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"What!" said Mr. Vavasor, jumping up from his seat. "You mean to give\r\nhim your money before you marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do;--if he should want it;--or, I should rather say, as\r\nmuch as he may want of it."\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth!" exclaimed Mr. Vavasor. "Alice, you must be mad."\r\n\r\n"To part with my money to my friend?" said she. "It is a kind of\r\nmadness of which I need not at any rate be ashamed."\r\n\r\n"Tell me this, Alice; has he got any of it as yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not a shilling. Papa, pray do not look at me like that. If I had no\r\nthought of marrying him you would not call me mad because I lent to\r\nmy cousin what money he might need."\r\n\r\n"I should only say that so much of your fortune was thrown away, and\r\nif it were not much that would be an end of it. I would sooner see\r\nyou surrender to him the half of all you have, without any engagement\r\nto marry him, than know that he had received a shilling from you\r\nunder such a promise."\r\n\r\n"You are prejudiced against him, sir."\r\n\r\n"Was it prejudice that made you reject him once before? Did you\r\ncondemn him then through prejudice? Had you not ascertained that he\r\nwas altogether unworthy of you?"\r\n\r\n"We were both younger, then," said Alice, speaking very softly, but\r\nvery seriously. "We were both much younger then, and looked at life\r\nwith other eyes than those which we now use. For myself I expected\r\nmuch then, which I now seem hardly to regard at all; and as for him,\r\nhe was then attached to pleasures to which I believe he has now\r\nlearned to be indifferent."\r\n\r\n"Psha!" ejaculated the father.\r\n\r\n"I can only speak as I believe," continued Alice. "And I think I may\r\nperhaps know more of his manner of life than you do, papa. But I am\r\nprepared to run risks now which I feared before. Even though he were\r\nall that you think him to be, I would still endeavour to do my duty\r\nto him, and to bring him to other things."\r\n\r\n"What is it you expect to get by marrying him?" asked Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"A husband whose mode of thinking is congenial to my own," answered\r\nAlice. "A husband who proposes to himself a career in life with which\r\nI can sympathize. I think that I may perhaps help my cousin in the\r\ncareer which he has chosen, and that alone is a great reason why I\r\nshould attempt to do so."\r\n\r\n"With your money?" said Mr. Vavasor with a sneer.\r\n\r\n"Partly with my money," said Alice, disdaining to answer the sneer.\r\n"Though it were only with my money, even that would be something."\r\n\r\n"Well, Alice, as your father, I can only implore you to pause before\r\nyou commit yourself to his hands. If he demands money from you, and\r\nyou are minded to give it to him, let him have it in moderation.\r\nAnything will be better than marrying him. I know that I cannot\r\nhinder you; you are as much your own mistress as I am my own\r\nmaster,--or rather a great deal more, as my income depends on my\r\ngoing to that horrid place in Chancery Lane. But yet I suppose you\r\nmust think something of your father\'s wishes and your father\'s\r\nopinion. It will not be pleasant for you to stand at the altar\r\nwithout my being there near you."\r\n\r\nTo this Alice made no answer; but she told herself that it had not\r\nbeen pleasant to her to have stood at so many places during the last\r\nfour years,--and to have found herself so often alone,--without her\r\nfather being near to her. That had been his fault, and it was not now\r\nin her power to remedy the ill-effects of it.\r\n\r\n"Has any day been fixed between you and him?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"Nothing has been said about that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; something has been said. I have told him that it cannot be for\r\na year yet. It is because I told him that, that I told him also that\r\nhe should have my money when he wanted it."\r\n\r\n"Not all of it?" said Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he will need it all. He intends to stand again for\r\nChelsea, and it is the great expense of the election which makes\r\nhim want money. You are not to suppose that he has asked me for it.\r\nWhen I made him understand that I did not wish to marry quite yet,\r\nI offered him the use of that which would be ultimately his own."\r\n\r\n"And he has accepted it?"\r\n\r\n"He answered me just as I had intended,--that when the need came he\r\nwould take me at my word."\r\n\r\n"Then, Alice, I will tell you what is my belief. He will drain you of\r\nevery shilling of your money, and when that is gone, there will be no\r\nmore heard of the marriage. We must take a small house in some cheap\r\npart of the town and live on my income as best we may. I shall go\r\nand insure my life, so that you may not absolutely starve when I\r\ndie." Having said this, Mr. Vavasor went away, not immediately to the\r\ninsurance office, as his words seemed to imply, but to his club where\r\nhe sat alone, reading the newspaper, very gloomily, till the time\r\ncame for his afternoon rubber of whist, and the club dinner bill for\r\nthe day was brought under his eye.\r\n\r\nAlice had no such consolations in her solitude. She had fought her\r\nbattle with her father tolerably well, but she was now called upon\r\nto fight a battle with herself, which was one much more difficult\r\nto win. Was her cousin, her betrothed as she now must regard him,\r\nthe worthless, heartless, mercenary rascal which her father painted\r\nhim? There had certainly been a time, and that not very long distant,\r\nin which Alice herself had been almost constrained so to regard him.\r\nSince that any change for the better in her opinion of him had been\r\ngrounded on evidence given either by himself or by his sister Kate.\r\nHe had done nothing to inspire her with any confidence, unless his\r\nreckless daring in coming forward to contest a seat in Parliament\r\ncould be regarded as a doing of something. And he had owned himself\r\nto be a man almost penniless; he had spoken of himself as being\r\nutterly reckless,--as being one whose standing in the world was and\r\nmust continue to be a perch on the edge of a precipice, from which\r\nany accident might knock him headlong. Alice believed in her heart\r\nthat this last profession or trade to which he had applied himself,\r\nwas becoming as nothing to him,--that he received from it no certain\r\nincome;--no income that a man could make to appear respectable to\r\nfathers or guardians when seeking a girl in marriage. Her father\r\ndeclared that all men spoke badly of him. Alice knew her father to be\r\nan idle man, a man given to pleasure, to be one who thought by far\r\ntoo much of the good things of the world; but she had never found him\r\nto be either false or malicious. His unwonted energy in this matter\r\nwas in itself evidence that he believed himself to be right in what\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Alice was frightened at what she had done, and\r\nalmost repented of it already. Her acceptance of her cousin\'s\r\noffer had not come of love;--nor had it, in truth, come chiefly of\r\nambition. She had not so much asked herself why she should do this\r\nthing, as why she should not do it,--seeing that it was required\r\nof her by her friend. What after all did it matter? That was her\r\nargument with herself. It cannot be supposed that she looked back\r\non the past events of her life with any self-satisfaction. There was\r\nno self-satisfaction, but in truth there was more self-reproach than\r\nshe deserved. As a girl she had loved her cousin George passionately,\r\nand that love had failed her. She did not tell herself that she had\r\nbeen wrong when she gave him up, but she thought herself to have been\r\nmost unfortunate in the one necessity. After such an experience as\r\nthat, would it not have been better for her to have remained without\r\nfurther thought of marriage?\r\n\r\nThen came that terrible episode in her life for which she never could\r\nforgive herself. She had accepted Mr. Grey because she liked him and\r\nhonoured him. "And I did love him," she said to herself, now on this\r\nmorning. Poor, wretched, heart-wrung woman! As she sat there thinking\r\nof it all in her solitude she was to be pitied at any rate, if not to\r\nbe forgiven. Now, as she thought of Nethercoats, with its quiet life,\r\nits gardens, its books, and the peaceful affectionate ascendancy of\r\nhim who would have been her lord and master, her feelings were very\r\ndifferent from those which had induced her to resolve that she would\r\nnot stoop to put her neck beneath that yoke. Would it not have been\r\nwell for her to have a master who by his wisdom and strength could\r\nsave her from such wretched doubtings as these? But she had refused\r\nto bend, and then she had found herself desolate and alone in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"If I can do him good why should I not marry him?" In that feeling\r\nhad been the chief argument which had induced her to return such\r\nan answer as she had sent to her cousin. "For myself, what does it\r\nmatter? As to this life of mine and all that belongs to it, why\r\nshould I regard it otherwise than to make it of some service to\r\nsome one who is dear to me?" He had been ever dear to her from her\r\nearliest years. She believed in his intellect, even if she could not\r\nbelieve in his conduct. Kate, her friend, longed for this thing. As\r\nfor that dream of love, it meant nothing; and as for those arguments\r\nof prudence,--that cold calculation about her money, which all people\r\nseemed to expect from her,--she would throw it to the winds. What if\r\nshe were ruined! There was always the other chance. She might save\r\nhim from ruin, and help him to honour and fortune.\r\n\r\nBut then, when the word was once past her lips, there returned to her\r\nthat true woman\'s feeling which made her plead for a long day,--which\r\nmade her feel that that long day would be all too short,--which made\r\nher already dread the coming of the end of the year. She had said\r\nthat she would become George Vavasor\'s wife, but she wished that the\r\nsaying so might be the end of it. When he came to her to embrace\r\nher how should she receive him? The memory of John Grey\'s last kiss\r\nstill lingered on her lips. She had told herself that she scorned the\r\ndelights of love; if it were so, was she not bound to keep herself\r\nfar from them; if it were so,--would not her cousin\'s kiss pollute\r\nher?\r\n\r\n"It may be as my father says," she thought. "It may be that he wants\r\nmy money only; if so, let him have it. Surely when the year is over\r\nI shall know." Then a plan formed itself in her head, which she did\r\nnot make willingly, with any voluntary action of her mind,--but which\r\ncame upon her as plans do come,--and recommended itself to her in\r\ndespite of herself. He should have her money as he might call for\r\nit,--all of it excepting some small portion of her income, which\r\nmight suffice to keep her from burdening her father. Then, if he were\r\ncontented, he should go free, without reproach, and there should be\r\nan end of all question of marriage for her.\r\n\r\nAs she thought of this, and matured it in her mind, the door opened,\r\nand the servant announced her cousin George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nPassion versus Prudence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to Alice that her accepted lover would come to\r\nher so soon. She had not told him expressly of the day on which she\r\nwould return, and had not reflected that Kate would certainly inform\r\nhim. She had been thinking so much of the distant perils of this\r\nengagement, that this peril, so sure to come upon her before many\r\ndays or hours could pass by, had been forgotten. When the name struck\r\nher ear, and George\'s step was heard outside on the landing-place,\r\nshe felt the blood rush violently to her heart, and she jumped up\r\nfrom her seat panic-stricken and in utter dismay. How should she\r\nreceive him? And then again, with what form of affection would she be\r\naccosted by him? But he was there in the room with her before she had\r\nhad a moment allowed to her for thought.\r\n\r\nShe hardly ventured to look up at him; but, nevertheless, she became\r\naware that there was something in his appearance and dress brighter,\r\nmore lover-like, perhaps newer, than was usual with him. This in\r\nitself was an affliction to her. He ought to have understood that\r\nsuch an engagement as theirs not only did not require, but absolutely\r\nforbade, any such symptom of young love as this. Even when their\r\nmarriage came, if it must come, it should come without any customary\r\nsign of smartness, without any outward mark of exaltation. It would\r\nhave been very good in him to have remained away from her for weeks\r\nand months; but to come upon her thus, on the first morning of her\r\nreturn, was a cruelty not to be forgiven. These were the feelings\r\nwith which Alice regarded her betrothed when he came to see her.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said he, coming up to her with his extended hand,--"Dearest\r\nAlice!"\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, and muttered some word which was inaudible\r\neven to him; she gave him her hand, and immediately endeavoured to\r\nresume it, but he held it clenched within his own, and she felt that\r\nshe was his prisoner. He was standing close to her now, and she could\r\nnot escape from him. She was trembling with fear lest worse might\r\nbetide her even than this. She had promised to marry him, and now she\r\nwas covered with dismay as she felt rather than thought how very far\r\nshe was from loving the man to whom she had given this promise.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he said, "I am a man once again. It is only now that I can\r\ntell you what I have suffered during these last few years." He still\r\nheld her hand, but he had not as yet attempted any closer embrace.\r\nShe knew that she was standing away from him awkwardly, almost\r\nshowing her repugnance to him; but it was altogether beyond her power\r\nto assume an attitude of ordinary ease. "Alice," he continued, "I\r\nfeel that I am a strong man again, armed to meet the world at all\r\npoints. Will you not let me thank you for what you have done for me?"\r\n\r\nShe must speak to him! Though the doing so should be ever so painful\r\nto her, she must say some word to him which should have in it a sound\r\nof kindness. After all, it was his undoubted right to come to her,\r\nand the footing on which he assumed to stand was simply that which\r\nshe herself had given to him. It was not his fault if at this moment\r\nhe inspired her with disgust rather than with love.\r\n\r\n"I have done nothing for you, George," she said, "nothing at all."\r\nThen she got her hand away from him, and retreated back to a sofa\r\nwhere she seated herself, leaving him still standing in the space\r\nbefore the fire. "That you may do much for yourself is my greatest\r\nhope. If I can help you, I will do so most heartily." Then she\r\nbecame thoroughly ashamed of her words, feeling that she was at once\r\noffering to him the use of her purse.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will help me," he said. "I am full of plans, all of\r\nwhich you must share with me. But now, at this moment, my one great\r\nplan is that in which you have already consented to be my partner.\r\nAlice, you are my wife now. Tell me that it will make you happy to\r\ncall me your husband."\r\n\r\nNot for worlds could she have said so at this moment. It was\r\nill-judged in him to press her thus. He should already have seen,\r\nwith half an eye, that no such triumph as that which he now demanded\r\ncould be his on this occasion. He had had his triumph when, in the\r\nsolitude of his own room, with quiet sarcasm he had thrown on one\r\nside of him the letter in which she had accepted him, as though the\r\nmatter had been one almost indifferent to him. He had no right to\r\nexpect the double triumph. Then he had frankly told himself that her\r\nmoney would be useful to him. He should have been contented with\r\nthat conviction, and not have required her also to speak to him soft\r\nwinning words of love.\r\n\r\n"That must be still distant, George," she said. "I have suffered so\r\nmuch!"\r\n\r\n"And it has been my fault that you have suffered; I know that. These\r\nyears of misery have been my doing." It was, however, the year of\r\ncoming misery that was the most to be dreaded.\r\n\r\n"I do not say that," she replied, "nor have I ever thought it. I have\r\nmyself and myself only to blame." Here he altogether misunderstood\r\nher, believing her to mean that the fault for which she blamed\r\nherself had been committed in separating herself from him on that\r\nformer occasion.\r\n\r\n"Alice, dear, let bygones be bygones."\r\n\r\n"Bygones will not be bygones. It may be well for people to say so,\r\nbut it is never true. One might as well say so to one\'s body as to\r\none\'s heart. But the hairs will grow grey, and the heart will grow\r\ncold."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that one follows upon the other," said George. "My hair\r\nis growing very grey;"--and to show that it was so, he lifted the\r\ndark lock from the side of his forehead, and displayed the incipient\r\ngrizzling of the hair from behind. "If grey hairs make an old man,\r\nAlice, you will marry an old husband; but even you shall not be\r\nallowed to say that my heart is old."\r\n\r\nThat word "husband," which her cousin had twice used, was painful to\r\nAlice\'s ear. She shrunk from it with palpable bodily suffering. Marry\r\nan old husband! His age was nothing to the purpose, though he had\r\nbeen as old as Enoch. But she was again obliged to answer him. "I\r\nspoke of my own heart," said she: "I sometimes feel that it has grown\r\nvery old."\r\n\r\n"Alice, that is hardly cheering to me."\r\n\r\n"You have come to me too quickly, George, and do not reflect how much\r\nthere is that I must remember. You have said that bygones should be\r\nbygones. Let them be so, at any rate as far as words are concerned.\r\nGive me a few months in which I may learn,--not to forget them, for\r\nthat will be impossible,--but to abstain from speaking of them."\r\n\r\nThere was something in her look as she spoke, and in the tone of her\r\nvoice that was very sad. It struck him forcibly, but it struck him\r\nwith anger rather than with sadness. Doubtless her money had been\r\nhis chief object when he offered to renew his engagement with her.\r\nDoubtless he would have made no such offer had she been penniless,\r\nor even had his own need been less pressing. But, nevertheless, he\r\ndesired something more than money. The triumph of being preferred\r\nto John Grey,--of having John Grey sent altogether adrift, in order\r\nthat his old love might be recovered, would have been too costly a\r\nluxury for him to seek, had he not in seeking it been able to combine\r\nprudence with the luxury. But though his prudence had been undoubted,\r\nhe desired the luxury also. It was on a calculation of the combined\r\nadvantage that he had made his second offer to his cousin. As he\r\nwould by no means have consented to proceed with the arrangement\r\nwithout the benefit of his cousin\'s money, so also did he feel\r\nunwilling to dispense with some expression of her love for him, which\r\nwould be to him triumphant. Hitherto in their present interview there\r\nhad certainly been no expression of her love.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he said, "your greeting to me is hardly all that I had\r\nhoped."\r\n\r\n"Is it not?" said she. "Indeed, George, I am sorry that you should\r\nbe disappointed; but what can I say? You would not have me affect a\r\nlightness of spirit which I do not feel?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish," said he, very slowly,--"if you wish to retract your\r\nletter to me, you now have my leave to do so."\r\n\r\nWhat an opportunity was this of escape! But she had not the courage\r\nto accept it. What girl, under such circumstances, would have had\r\nsuch courage? How often are offers made to us which we would almost\r\ngive our eyes to accept, but dare not accept because we fear the\r\ncountenance of the offerer? "I do not wish to retract my letter,"\r\nsaid she, speaking as slowly as he had spoken; "but I wish to be left\r\nawhile, that I may recover my strength of mind. Have you not heard\r\ndoctors say, that muscles which have been strained, should be allowed\r\nrest, or they will never entirely renew their tension? It is so with\r\nme now; if I could be quiet for a few months, I think I could learn\r\nto face the future with a better courage."\r\n\r\n"And is that all you can say to me, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"What would you have me say?"\r\n\r\n"I would fain hear one word of love from you; is that unreasonable?\r\nI would wish to know from your own lips that you have satisfaction in\r\nthe renewed prospect of our union; is that too ambitious? It might\r\nhave been that I was over-bold in pressing my suit upon you again;\r\nbut as you accepted it, have I not a right to expect that you should\r\nshow me that you have been happy in accepting it?"\r\n\r\nBut she had not been happy in accepting it. She was not happy now\r\nthat she had accepted it. She could not show to him any sign of such\r\njoy as that which he desired to see. And now, at this moment, she\r\nfeared with an excessive fear that there would come some demand for\r\nan outward demonstration of love, such as he in his position might\r\nhave a right to make. She seemed to be aware that this might be\r\nprevented only by such demeanour on her part as that which she had\r\npractised, and she could not, therefore, be stirred to the expression\r\nof any word of affection. She listened to his appeal, and when it was\r\nfinished she made no reply. If he chose to take her in dudgeon, he\r\nmust do so. She would make for him any sacrifice that was possible to\r\nher, but this sacrifice was not possible.\r\n\r\n"And you have not a word to say to me?" he asked. She looked up at\r\nhim, and saw that the cicature on his face was becoming ominous; his\r\neyes were bent upon her with all their forbidding brilliance, and he\r\nwas assuming that look of angry audacity which was so peculiar to\r\nhim, and which had so often cowed those with whom he was brought in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n"No other word, at present, George; I have told you that I am not at\r\nease. Why do you press me now?"\r\n\r\nHe had her letter to him in the breast-pocket of his coat, and\r\nhis hand was on it, that he might fling it back to her, and tell\r\nher that he would not hold her to be his promised wife under such\r\ncircumstances as these. The anger which would have induced him to do\r\nso was the better part of his nature. Three or four years since, this\r\nbetter part would have prevailed, and he would have given way to his\r\nrage. But now, as his fingers played upon the paper, he remembered\r\nthat her money was absolutely essential to him,--that some of it was\r\nneeded by him almost instantly,--that on this very morning he was\r\nbound to go where money would be demanded from him, and that his\r\nhopes with regard to Chelsea could not be maintained unless he was\r\nable to make some substantial promise of providing funds. His sister\r\nKate\'s fortune was just two thousand pounds. That, and no more, was\r\nnow the capital at his command, if he should abandon this other\r\nsource of aid. Even that must go, if all other sources should fail\r\nhim; but he would fain have that untouched, if it were possible. Oh,\r\nthat that old man in Westmoreland would die and be gathered to his\r\nfathers, now that he was full of years and ripe for the sickle! But\r\nthere was no sign of death about the old man. So his fingers released\r\ntheir hold on the letter, and he stood looking at her in his anger.\r\n\r\n"You wish me then to go from you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Do not be angry with me, George!"\r\n\r\n"Angry! I have no right to be angry. But, by heaven, I am wrong\r\nthere. I have the right, and I am angry. I think you owed it me to\r\ngive me some warmer welcome. Is it to be thus with us always for the\r\nnext accursed year?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"To me it will be accursed. But is it to be thus between us always?\r\nAlice, I have loved you above all women. I may say that I have never\r\nloved any woman but you; and yet I am sometimes driven to doubt\r\nwhether you have a heart in you capable of love. After all that has\r\npassed, all your old protestations, all my repentance, and your\r\nproffer of forgiveness, you should have received me with open arms.\r\nI suppose I may go now, and feel that I have been kicked out of your\r\nhouse like a dog."\r\n\r\n"If you speak to me like that, and look at me like that, how can I\r\nanswer you?"\r\n\r\n"I want no answer. I wanted you to put your hand in mine, to kiss me,\r\nand to tell me that you are once more my own. Alice, think better of\r\nit; kiss me, and let me feel my arm once more round your waist."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered as she sat, still silent, on her seat, and he saw that\r\nshe shuddered. With all his desire for her money,--his instant need\r\nof it,--this was too much for him; and he turned upon his heel, and\r\nleft the room without another word. She heard his quick step as he\r\nhurried down the stairs, but she did not rise to arrest him. She\r\nheard the door slam as he left the house, but still she did not move\r\nfrom her seat. Her immediate desire had been that he should go,--and\r\nnow he was gone. There was in that a relief which almost comforted\r\nher. And this was the man from whom, within the last few days, she\r\nhad accepted an offer of marriage.\r\n\r\nGeorge, when he left the house, walked hurriedly into Cavendish\r\nSquare, and down along the east side, till he made his way out along\r\nPrinces Street, into the Circus in Oxford Street. Close to him there,\r\nin Great Marlborough Street, was the house of his parliamentary\r\nattorney, Mr. Scruby, on whom he was bound to call on that morning. As\r\nhe had walked away from Queen Anne Street, he had thought of nothing\r\nbut that too visible shudder which his cousin Alice had been unable\r\nto repress. He had been feeding on his anger, and indulging it,\r\ntelling himself at one moment that he would let her and her money\r\ngo from him whither they list,--and making inward threats in the\r\nnext that the time should come in which he would punish her for this\r\nill-usage. But there was the necessity of resolving what he would say\r\nto Mr. Scruby. To Mr. Scruby was still due some trifle on the cost of\r\nthe last election; but even if this were paid, Mr. Scruby would make\r\nno heavy advance towards the expense of the next election. Whoever\r\nmight come out at the end of such affairs without a satisfactory\r\nsettlement of his little bill, as had for a while been the case with\r\nMr. Grimes, from the "Handsome Man,"--and as, indeed, still was the\r\ncase with him, as that note of hand at three months\' date was not yet\r\npaid,--Mr. Scruby seldom allowed himself to suffer. It was true that\r\nthe election would not take place till the summer; but there were\r\npreliminary expenses which needed ready money. Metropolitan voters,\r\nas Mr. Scruby often declared, required to be kept in good humour,--so\r\nthat Mr. Scruby wanted the present payment of some five hundred\r\npounds, and a well-grounded assurance that he would be put in full\r\nfunds by the beginning of next June. Even Mr. Scruby might not be true\r\nas perfect steel, if he thought that his candidate at the last moment\r\nwould not come forth properly prepared. Other candidates, with money\r\nin their pockets, might find their way into Mr. Scruby\'s offices.\r\nAs George Vavasor crossed Regent Street, he gulped down his anger,\r\nand applied his mind to business. Should he prepare himself to give\r\norders that Kate\'s little property should be sold out, or would he\r\nresolve to use his cousin\'s money? That his cousin\'s money would\r\nstill be at his disposal, in spite of the stormy mood in which he had\r\nretreated from her presence, he felt sure; but the asking for it on\r\nhis part would be unpleasant. That duty he must entrust to Kate. But\r\nas he reached Mr. Scruby\'s door, he had decided that for such purposes\r\nas those now in hand, it was preferable that he should use his wife\'s\r\nfortune. It was thus that in his own mind he worded the phrase, and\r\nmade for himself an excuse. Yes;--he would use his wife\'s fortune,\r\nand explain to Mr. Scruby that he would be justified in doing so\r\nby the fact that his own heritage would be settled on her at her\r\nmarriage. I do not suppose that he altogether liked it. He was not,\r\nat any rate as yet, an altogether heartless swindler. He could not\r\ntake his cousin\'s money without meaning,--without thinking that he\r\nmeant, to repay her in full all that he took. Her behaviour to him\r\nthis very morning had no doubt made the affair more difficult to\r\nhis mind, and more unpleasant than it would have been had she smiled\r\non him; but even as it was, he managed to assure himself that he\r\nwas doing her no wrong, and with this self-assurance he entered Mr.\r\nScruby\'s office.\r\n\r\nThe clerks in the outer office were very civil to him, and undertook\r\nto promise him that he should not be kept waiting an instant. There\r\nwere four gentlemen in the little parlour, they said, waiting to see\r\nMr. Scruby, but there they should remain till Mr. Vavasor\'s interview\r\nwas over. One gentleman, as it seemed, was even turned out to make\r\nway for him; for as George was ushered into the lawyer\'s room, a\r\nlittle man, looking very meek, was hurried away from it.\r\n\r\n"You can wait, Smithers," said Mr. Scruby, speaking from within. "I\r\nshan\'t be very long." Vavasor apologized to his agent for the injury\r\nhe was doing Smithers; but Mr. Scruby explained that he was only a\r\npoor devil of a printer, looking for payment of his little account.\r\nHe had printed and posted 30,000 placards for one of the late\r\nMarylebone candidates, and found some difficulty in getting his\r\nmoney. "You see, when they\'re in a small way of business, it ruins\r\nthem," said Scruby. "Now that poor devil,--he hasn\'t had a shilling\r\nof his money yet, and the greater part has been paid out of his\r\npocket to the posters. It is hard."\r\n\r\nIt comforted Vavasor when he thus heard that there were others who\r\nwere more backward in their payments, even than himself, and made him\r\nreflect that a longer credit than had yet been achieved by him, might\r\nperhaps be within his reach. "It is astonishing how much a man may\r\nget done for him," said he, "without paying anything for years."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s true. So he may, if he knows how to go about it. But\r\nwhen he does pay, Mr. Vavasor, he does it through the nose;--cent. per\r\ncent., and worse, for all his former shortcomings."\r\n\r\n"How many there are who never pay at all," said George.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Vavasor;--that\'s true, too. But see what a life they lead.\r\nIt isn\'t a pleasant thing to be afraid of coming into your agent\'s\r\noffice; not what you would like, Mr. Vavasor;--not if I know you."\r\n\r\n"I never was afraid of meeting anyone yet," said Vavasor; "but I\r\ndon\'t know what I may come to."\r\n\r\n"Nor never will, I\'ll go bail. But, Lord love you, I could tell\r\nyou such tales! I\'ve had Members of Parliament, past, present, and\r\nfuture, almost down on their knees to me in this little room. It\'s\r\nabout a month or six weeks before the elections come on when they\'re\r\nat their worst. There is so much you see, Mr. Vavasor, for which a\r\ngentleman must pay ready money. It isn\'t like a business in which a\r\nlawyer is supposed to find the capital. If I had money enough to pay\r\nout of my own pocket all the cost of all the metropolitan gentlemen\r\nfor whom I act, why, I could live on the interest without any\r\ntrouble, and go into Parliament myself like a man."\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor perfectly understood that Mr. Scruby was explaining to\r\nhim, with what best attempt at delicacy he could make, that funds for\r\nthe expense of the Chelsea election were not to be forthcoming from\r\nthe Great Marlborough Street establishment.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said he. "But you do do it sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Never, Mr. Vavasor," said Mr. Scruby, very solemnly. "As a rule,\r\nnever. I may advance the money, on interest, of course, when I\r\nreceive a guarantee from the candidate\'s father, or from six or\r\nseven among the committee, who must all be very substantial,--very\r\nsubstantial indeed. But in a general way I don\'t do it. It isn\'t my\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"I thought you did;--but at any rate I don\'t want you to do it for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure you don\'t," said Mr. Scruby, with a brighter tone of\r\nvoice than that he had just been using. "I never thought you did, Mr.\r\nVavasor. Lord bless you, Mr. Vavasor, I know the difference between\r\ngentlemen as soon as I see them."\r\n\r\nThen they went to business, and Vavasor became aware that it would be\r\nthought convenient that he should lodge with Mr. Scruby, to his own\r\naccount, a sum not less than six hundred pounds within the next week,\r\nand it would be also necessary that he should provide for taking up\r\nthat bill, amounting to ninety-two pounds, which he had given to\r\nthe landlord of the "Handsome Man." In short, it would be well that\r\nhe should borrow a thousand pounds from Alice, and as he did not\r\nwish that the family attorney of the Vavasors should be employed\r\nto raise it, he communicated to Mr. Scruby as much of his plans as\r\nwas necessary,--feeling more hesitation in doing it than might have\r\nbeen expected from him. When he had done so, he was very intent on\r\nexplaining also that the money taken from his cousin, and future\r\nbride, would be repaid to her out of the property in Westmoreland,\r\nwhich was,--did he say settled on himself? I am afraid he did.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes;--a family arrangement," said Mr. Scruby, as he\r\ncongratulated him on his proposed marriage. Mr. Scruby did not care a\r\nstraw from what source the necessary funds might be drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nJohn Grey Goes a Second Time to London.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in that conversation which Mr. Vavasor had with his daughter,\r\nand which was recorded a few pages back, he implored her to pause a\r\nwhile before she informed Mr. Grey of her engagement with her cousin.\r\nNothing, however, on that point had been settled between them. Mr.\r\nVavasor had wished her to say that she would not write till he should\r\nhave assented to her doing so. She had declined to bind herself in\r\nthis way, and then they had gone off to other things;--to George\r\nVavasor\'s character and the disposition of her money. Alice, however,\r\nhad felt herself bound not to write to Mr. Grey quite at once. Indeed,\r\nwhen her cousin left her she had no appetite for writing such a\r\nletter as hers was to be. A day or two passed by her in this way, and\r\nnothing more was said by her or her father. It was now the middle of\r\nJanuary, and the reader may remember that Mr. Grey had promised that\r\nhe would come to her in London in that month, as soon as he should\r\nknow that she had returned from Westmoreland. She must at any rate\r\ndo something to prevent that visit. Mr. Grey would not come without\r\ngiving her notice. She knew enough of the habits of the man to be\r\nsure of that. But she desired that her letter to him should be in\r\ntime to prevent his to her; so when those few days were gone, she sat\r\ndown to write without speaking to her father again upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible job;--perhaps the most difficult of all the\r\ndifficult tasks which her adverse fate had imposed upon her. She\r\nfound when she did attempt it, that she could have done it better if\r\nshe had done it at the moment when she was writing the other letter\r\nto her cousin George. Then Kate had been near her, and she had been\r\ncomforted by Kate\'s affectionate happiness. She had been strengthened\r\nat that moment by a feeling that she was doing the best in her power,\r\nif not for herself, at any rate for others. All that comfort and\r\nall that strength had left her now. The atmosphere of the fells had\r\nbuoyed her up, and now the thick air of London depressed her. She\r\nsat for hours with the pen in her hand, and could not write the\r\nletter. She let a day go by and a night, and still it was not written.\r\nShe hardly knew herself in her unnatural weakness. As the mental\r\nphotographs of the two men forced themselves upon her, she could\r\nnot force herself to forget those words--"Look here, upon this\r\npicture--and on this." How was it that she now knew how great was\r\nthe difference between the two men, how immense the pre-eminence of\r\nhim whom she had rejected;--and that she had not before been able\r\nto see this on any of those many previous occasions on which she had\r\ncompared the two together? As she thought of her cousin George\'s face\r\nwhen he left her room a few days since, and remembered Mr. Grey\'s\r\ncountenance when last he held her hand at Cheltenham, the quiet\r\ndignity of his beauty which would submit to show no consciousness\r\nof injury, she could not but tell herself that when Paradise had\r\nbeen opened to her, she had declared herself to be fit only for\r\nPandemonium. In that was her chief misery; that now,--now when it was\r\ntoo late,--she could look at it aright.\r\n\r\nBut the letter must be written, and on the second day she declared\r\nto herself that she would not rise from her chair till it was done.\r\nThe letter was written on that day and was posted. I will now ask the\r\nreader to go down with me to Nethercoats that we may be present with\r\nJohn Grey when he received it. He was sitting at breakfast in his\r\nstudy there, and opposite to him, lounging in an arm-chair, with a\r\n_Quarterly_ in his hand, was the most intimate of his friends, Frank\r\nSeward, a fellow of the college to which they had both belonged. Mr.\r\nSeward was a clergyman, and the tutor of his college, and a man who\r\nworked very hard at Cambridge. In the days of his leisure he spent\r\nmuch of his time at Nethercoats, and he was the only man to whom Grey\r\nhad told anything of his love for Alice and of his disappointment.\r\nEven to Seward he had not told the whole story. He had at first\r\ninformed his friend that he was engaged to be married, and as he had\r\ntold this as no secret,--having even said that he hated secrets on\r\nsuch matters,--the engagement had been mentioned in the common room\r\nof their college, and men at Cambridge knew that Mr. Grey was going\r\nto take to himself a wife. Then Mr. Seward had been told that trouble\r\nhad come, and that it was not improbable that there would be no such\r\nmarriage. Even when saying this Mr. Grey told none of the particulars,\r\nthough he owned to his friend that a heavy blow had struck him. His\r\nintimacy with Seward was of that thorough kind which is engendered\r\nonly out of such young and lasting friendship as had existed between\r\nthem; but even to such a friend as this Mr. Grey could not open his\r\nwhole heart. It was only to a friend who should also be his wife that\r\nhe could do that,--as he himself thoroughly understood. He had felt\r\nthat such a friend was wanting to him, and he had made the attempt.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of this as yet," he had said to Mr. Seward. "Of course\r\nwhen the matter is settled, those few people who know me must know\r\nit. But perhaps there may be a doubt as yet, and as long as there is\r\na doubt, it is better that it should not be discussed."\r\n\r\nHe had said no more than this,--had imputed no blame to Alice,--had\r\ntold none of the circumstances; but Seward had known that the girl\r\nhad jilted his friend, and had made up his mind that she must be\r\nheartless and false. He had known also that his friend would never\r\nlook for any other such companion for his home.\r\n\r\nLetters were brought to each of them on this morning, and Seward\'s\r\nattention was of course occupied by those which he received. Grey,\r\nas soon as the envelopes had touched his hand, became aware that one\r\nof them was from Alice, and this he at once opened. He did it very\r\ncalmly, but without any of that bravado of indifference with which\r\nGeorge Vavasor had received Alice\'s letter from Westmoreland. "It is\r\nright that I should tell you at once," said Alice, rushing into the\r\nmiddle of her subject without even the formality of the customary\r\naddress--"It is right that I should tell you at once that--." Oh,\r\nthe difficulty which she had encountered when her words had carried\r\nher as far as this!--"that my cousin, George Vavasor, has repeated\r\nto me his offer of marriage, and that I have accepted it. I tell\r\nyou, chiefly in order that I may save you from the trouble which you\r\npurposed to take when I last saw you at Cheltenham. I will not tell\r\nyou any of the circumstances of this engagement, because I have no\r\nright to presume that you will care to hear them. I hardly dare\r\nto ask you to believe of me that in all that I have done, I have\r\nendeavoured to act with truth and honesty. That I have been very\r\nignorant, foolish,--what you will that is bad, I know well; otherwise\r\nthere could not have been so much in the last few years of my life\r\non which I am utterly ashamed to look back. For the injury that I\r\nhave done you, I can only express deep contrition. I do not dare to\r\nask you to forgive me.--ALICE VAVASOR." She had tormented herself in\r\nwriting this,--had so nearly driven herself distracted with attempts\r\nwhich she had destroyed, that she would not even read once to herself\r\nthese last words. "He\'ll know it, and that is all that is necessary,"\r\nshe said to herself as she sent the letter away from her.\r\n\r\nMr. Grey read it twice over, leaving the other letters unnoticed on\r\nthe table by his tea-cup. He read it twice over, and the work of\r\nreading it was one to him of intense agony. Hitherto he had fed\r\nhimself with hope. That Alice should have been brought to think of\r\nher engagement with him in a spirit of doubt and with a mind so\r\ntroubled, that she had been inclined to attempt an escape from it,\r\nhad been very grievous to him; but it had been in his mind a fantasy,\r\na morbid fear of himself, which might be cured by time. He, at any\r\nrate, would give all his energies towards achieving such a cure.\r\nThere had been one thing, however, which he most feared;--which he\r\nhad chiefly feared, though he had forbidden himself to think that it\r\ncould be probable, and this thing had now happened.\r\n\r\nHe had ever disliked and feared George Vavasor;--not from any effect\r\nwhich the man had upon himself, for as we know his acquaintance with\r\nVavasor was of the slightest;--but he had feared and disliked his\r\ninfluence upon Alice. He had also feared the influence of her cousin\r\nKate. To have cautioned Alice against her cousins would have been to\r\nhim impossible. It was not his nature to express suspicion to one he\r\nloved. Is the tone of that letter remembered in which he had answered\r\nAlice when she informed him that her cousin George was to go with\r\nKate and her to Switzerland? He had written, with a pleasant joke,\r\nwords which Alice had been able to read with some little feeling of\r\ntriumph to her two friends. He had not so written because he liked\r\nwhat he knew of the man. He disliked all that he knew of him. But it\r\nhad not been possible for him to show that he distrusted the prudence\r\nof her, whom, as his future wife, he was prepared to trust in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI have said that he read Alice\'s letter with an agony of sorrow; as\r\nhe sat with it in his hand he suffered as, probably, he had never\r\nsuffered before. But there was nothing in his countenance to show\r\nthat he was in pain. Seward had received some long epistle, crossed\r\nfrom end to end,--indicative, I should say, of a not far distant\r\ntermination to that college tutorship,--and was reading it with\r\nplacid contentment. It did not occur to him to look across at Grey,\r\nbut had he done so, I doubt whether he would have seen anything to\r\nattract his attention. But Grey, though he was wounded, would not\r\nallow himself to be dismayed. There was less hope now than before,\r\nbut there might still be hope;--hope for her, even though there might\r\nbe none for him. Tidings had reached his ears also as to George\r\nVavasor, which had taught him to believe that the man was needy,\r\nreckless, and on the brink of ruin. Such a marriage to Alice Vavasor\r\nwould be altogether ruinous. Whatever might be his own ultimate fate\r\nhe would still seek to save her from that. Her cousin, doubtless,\r\nwanted her money. Might it not be possible that he would be satisfied\r\nwith her money, and that thus the woman might be saved?\r\n\r\n"Seward," he said at last, addressing his friend, who had not yet\r\ncome to the end of the last crossed page.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything wrong?" said Seward.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; there is something a little wrong. I fear I must leave\r\nyou, and go up to town to-day."\r\n\r\n"Nobody ill, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"No;--nobody is ill. But I must go up to London. Mrs. Bole will take\r\ncare of you, and you must not be angry with me for leaving you."\r\n\r\nSeward assured him that he would not be in the least angry, and\r\nthat he was thoroughly conversant with the capabilities and good\r\nintentions of Mrs. Bole the housekeeper; but added, that as he was\r\nso near his own college, he would of course go back to Cambridge.\r\nHe longed to say some word as to the purpose of Grey\'s threatened\r\njourney; to make some inquiry as to this new trouble; but he knew\r\nthat Grey was a man who did not well bear close inquiries, and he was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"Why not stay here?" said Grey, after a minute\'s pause. "I wish\r\nyou would, old fellow; I do, indeed." There was a tone of special\r\naffection in his voice which struck Seward at once. "If I can be of\r\nthe slightest service or comfort to you, I will of course."\r\n\r\nGrey again sat silent for a little while. "I wish you would; I do,\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"Then I will." And again there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"I have got a letter here from--Miss Vavasor," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"May I hope that--"\r\n\r\n"No;--it does not bring good news to me. I do not know that I can\r\ntell it you all. I would if I could, but the whole story is one not\r\nto be told in a hurry. I should leave false impressions. There are\r\nthings which a man cannot tell."\r\n\r\n"Indeed there are," said Seward.\r\n\r\n"I wish with all my heart that you knew it all as I know it; but that\r\nis impossible. There are things which happen in a day which it would\r\ntake a lifetime to explain." Then there was another pause. "I have\r\nheard bad news this morning, and I must go up to London at once. I\r\nshall go into Ely so as to be there by twelve; and if you will, you\r\nshall drive me over. I may be back in a day; certainly in less than\r\na week; but it will be a comfort to me to know that I shall find you\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nThe matter was so arranged, and at eleven they started. During\r\nthe first two miles not a word was spoken between them. "Seward,"\r\nGrey said at last, "if I fail in what I am going to attempt, it is\r\nprobable that you will never hear Alice Vavasor\'s name mentioned by\r\nme again; but I want you always to bear this in mind;--that at no\r\nmoment has my opinion of her ever been changed, nor must you in such\r\ncase imagine from my silence that it has changed. Do you understand\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I think I do."\r\n\r\n"To my thinking she is the finest of God\'s creatures that I have\r\nknown. It may be that in her future life she will be severed from me\r\naltogether; but I shall not, therefore, think the less well of her;\r\nand I wish that you, as my friend, should know that I so esteem her,\r\neven though her name should never be mentioned between us." Seward,\r\nin some few words, assured him that it should be so, and then they\r\nfinished their journey in silence.\r\n\r\nFrom the station at Ely, Grey sent a message by the wires up to John\r\nVavasor, saying that he would call on him that afternoon at his\r\noffice in Chancery Lane. The chances were always much against finding\r\nMr. Vavasor at his office; but on this occasion the telegram did reach\r\nhim there, and he remained till the unaccustomed hour of half past\r\nfour to meet the man who was to have been his son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard from her?" he asked as soon as Grey entered the dingy\r\nlittle room, not in Chancery Lane, but in its neighbourhood, which\r\nwas allocated to him for his signing purposes.\r\n\r\n"Yes,"--said Grey; "she has written to me."\r\n\r\n"And told you about her cousin George. I tried to hinder her from\r\nwriting, but she is very wilful."\r\n\r\n"Why should you have hindered her? If the thing was to be told, it is\r\nbetter that it should be done at once."\r\n\r\n"But I hoped that there might be an escape. I don\'t know what you\r\nthink of all this, Grey, but to me it is the bitterest misfortune\r\nthat I have known. And I\'ve had some bitter things, too," he\r\nadded,--thinking of that period of his life, when the work of which\r\nhe was ashamed was first ordained as his future task.\r\n\r\n"What is the escape that you hoped?" asked Grey.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know. The whole thing seems to me to be so mad, that I\r\npartly trusted that she would see the madness of it. I am not sure\r\nwhether you know anything of my nephew George?" asked Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"Very little," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"I believe him to be utterly an adventurer,--a man without means and\r\nwithout principle,--upon the whole about as bad a man as you may\r\nmeet. I give you my word, Grey, that I don\'t think I know a worse\r\nman. He\'s going to marry her for her money; then he will beggar her,\r\nafter that he\'ll ill-treat her, and yet what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Prevent the marriage."\r\n\r\n"But how, my dear fellow? Prevent it! It\'s all very well to say that,\r\nand it\'s the very thing I want to do. But how am I to prevent it?\r\nShe\'s as much her own master as you are yours. She can give him every\r\nshilling of her fortune to-morrow. How am I to prevent her from\r\nmarrying him?"\r\n\r\n"Let her give him every shilling of her fortune to-morrow," said\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\n"And what is she to do then?" asked Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"Then--then,--then,--then let her come to me," said John Grey; and as\r\nhe spoke there was the fragment of a tear in his eye, and the hint of\r\nquiver in his voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Then--then,--then let her come to me."]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the worldly, worn-out, unsympathetic nature of John Vavasor was\r\nstruck, and, as it were, warmed by this.\r\n\r\n"God bless you; God bless you, my dear fellow. I heartily wish\r\nfor her sake that I could look forward to any such an end to this\r\naffair."\r\n\r\n"And why not look forward to it? You say that he merely wants her\r\nmoney. As he wants it let him have it!"\r\n\r\n"But Grey, you do not know Alice; you do not understand my girl. When\r\nshe had lost her fortune nothing would induce her to become your\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"Leave that to follow as it may," said John Grey. "Our first object\r\nmust be to sever her from a man, who is, as you say, himself on the\r\nverge of ruin; and who would certainly make her wretched. I am here\r\nnow, not because I wish her to be my own wife, but because I wish\r\nthat she should not become the wife of such a one as your nephew. If\r\nI were you I would let him have her money."\r\n\r\n"If you were I, you would have nothing more to do with it than the\r\nman that is as yet unborn. I know that she will give him her money\r\nbecause she has said so; but I have no power as to her giving it or\r\nas to her withholding it. That\'s the hardship of my position;--but it\r\nis of no use to think of that now."\r\n\r\nJohn Grey certainly did not think about it. He knew well that Alice\r\nwas independent, and that she was not inclined to give up that\r\nindependence to anyone. He had not expected that her father would\r\nbe able to do much towards hindering his daughter from becoming the\r\nwife of George Vavasor, but he had wished that he himself and her\r\nfather should be in accord in their views, and he found that this\r\nwas so. When he left Mr. Vavasor\'s room nothing had been said about\r\nthe period of the marriage. Grey thought it improbable that Alice\r\nwould find herself able to give herself in marriage to her cousin\r\nimmediately,--so soon after her breach with him; but as to this he\r\nhad no assurance, and he determined to have the facts from her own\r\nlips, if she would see him. So he wrote to her, naming a day on which\r\nhe would call upon her early in the morning; and having received\r\nfrom her no prohibition, he was in Queen Anne Street at the hour\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nHe had conceived a scheme which he had not made known to Mr. Vavasor,\r\nand as to the practicability of which he had much doubt; but which,\r\nnevertheless, he was resolved to try if he should find the attempt\r\npossible. He himself would buy off George Vavasor. He had ever been a\r\nprudent man, and he had money at command. If Vavasor was such a man\r\nas they, who knew him best, represented him, such a purchase might be\r\npossible. But then, before this was attempted, he must be quite sure\r\nthat he knew his man, and he must satisfy himself also that in doing\r\nso he would not, in truth, add to Alice\'s misery. He could hardly\r\nbring himself to think it possible that she did, in truth, love her\r\ncousin with passionate love. It seemed to him, as he remembered what\r\nAlice had been to himself, that this must be impossible. But if it\r\nwere so, that of course must put an end to his interference. He\r\nthought that if he saw her he might learn all this, and therefore he\r\nwent to Queen Anne Street.\r\n\r\n"Of course he must come if he will," she said to herself when she\r\nreceived his note. "It can make no matter. He will say nothing half\r\nso hard to me as what I say to myself all day long." But when the\r\nmorning came, and the hour came, and the knock at the door for which\r\nher ears were on the alert, her heart misgave her, and she felt that\r\nthe present moment of her punishment, though not the heaviest, would\r\nstill be hard to bear.\r\n\r\nHe came slowly up-stairs,--his step was ever slow,--and gently opened\r\nthe door for himself. Then, before he even looked at her, he closed\r\nit again. I do not know how to explain that it was so; but it was\r\nthis perfect command of himself at all seasons which had in part made\r\nAlice afraid of him, and drove her to believe that they were not\r\nfitted for each other. She, when he thus turned for a moment from\r\nher, and then walked slowly towards her, stood with both her hands\r\nleaning on the centre table of the room, and with her eyes fixed upon\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he said, walking up to her very slowly.\r\n\r\nHer whole frame shuddered as she heard the sweetness of his voice.\r\nHad I not better tell the truth of her at once? Oh, if she could only\r\nhave been his again! What madness during these last six months had\r\ndriven her to such a plight as this! The old love came back upon\r\nher. Nay; it had never gone. But that trust in his love returned to\r\nher,--that trust which told her that such love and such worth would\r\nhave sufficed to make her happy. But this confidence in him was\r\nworthless now! Even though he should desire it, she could not change\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he said again. And then, as slowly she looked up at him, he\r\nasked her for her hand. "You may give it me," he said, "as to an old\r\nfriend." She put her hand in his hand, and then, withdrawing it, felt\r\nthat she must never trust herself to do so again.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he continued, "I do not expect you to say much to me; but\r\nthere is a question or two which I think you will answer. Has a day\r\nbeen fixed for this marriage?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said.\r\n\r\n"Will it be in a month?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no;--not for a year," she replied hurriedly;--and he knew at\r\nonce by her voice that she already dreaded this new wedlock. Whatever\r\nof anger he might before have felt for her was banished. She had\r\nbrought herself by her ill-judgement,--by her ignorance, as she had\r\nconfessed,--to a sad pass; but he believed that she was still worthy\r\nof his love.\r\n\r\n"And now one other question, Alice;--but if you are silent, I will\r\nnot ask it again. Can you tell me why you have again accepted your\r\ncousin\'s offer?"\r\n\r\n"Because--," she said very quickly, looking up as though she were\r\nabout to speak with all her old courage. "But you would never\r\nunderstand me," she said,--"and there can be no reason why I should\r\ndare to hope that you should ever think well of me again."\r\n\r\nHe knew that there was no love,--no love for that man to whom she\r\nhad pledged her hand. He did not know, on the other hand, how strong,\r\nhow unchanged, how true was her love for himself. Indeed, of himself\r\nhe was thinking not at all. He desired to learn whether she would\r\nsuffer, if by any scheme he might succeed in breaking off this\r\nmarriage. When he had asked her whether she were to be married at\r\nonce, she had shuddered at the thought. When he asked her why she\r\nhad accepted her cousin, she had faltered, and hinted at some excuse\r\nwhich he might fail to understand. Had she loved George Vavasor, he\r\ncould have understood that well enough.\r\n\r\n"Alice," he said, speaking still very slowly, "nothing has ever yet\r\nbeen done which need to a certainty separate you and me. I am a\r\npersistent man, and I do not even yet give up all hope. A year is a\r\nlong time. As you say yourself, I do not as yet quite understand you.\r\nBut, Alice,--and I think that the position in which we stood a few\r\nmonths since justifies me in saying so without offence,--I love you\r\nnow as well as ever, and should things change with you, I cannot tell\r\nyou with how much joy and eagerness I should take you back to my\r\nbosom. My heart is yours now as it has been since I knew you."\r\n\r\nThen he again just touched her hand, and left her before she had been\r\nable to answer a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nMr. Tombe\'s Advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice sat alone for an hour without moving when John Grey had left\r\nher, and the last words which he had uttered were sounding in her\r\nears all the time, "My heart is still yours, as it has been since I\r\nknew you." There had been something in his words which had soothed\r\nher spirits, and had, for the moment, almost comforted her. At any\r\nrate, he did not despise her. He could not have spoken such words as\r\nthese to her had he not still held her high in his esteem. Nay;--had\r\nhe not even declared that he would yet take her as his own if she\r\nwould come to him? "I cannot tell you with how much joy I would take\r\nyou back to my bosom!" Ah! that might never be. But yet the assurance\r\nhad been sweet to her;--dangerously sweet, as she soon told herself.\r\nShe knew that she had lost her Eden, but it was something to her that\r\nthe master of the garden had not himself driven her forth. She sat\r\nthere, thinking of her fate, as though it belonged to some other\r\none,--not to herself; as though it were a tale that she had read.\r\nHerself she had shipwrecked altogether; but though she might sink,\r\nshe had not been thrust from the ship by hands which she loved.\r\n\r\nBut would it not have been better that he should have scorned her\r\nand reviled her? Had he been able to do so, he at least would have\r\nescaped the grief of disappointed love. Had he learned to despise\r\nher, he would have ceased to regret her. She had no right to feel\r\nconsolation in the fact that his sufferings were equal to her own.\r\nBut when she thought of this, she told herself that it could not be\r\nthat it was so. He was a man, she said, not passionate by nature.\r\nAlas! it was the mistake she had ever made when summing up the items\r\nof his character! He might be persistent, she thought, in still\r\nstriving to do that upon which he had once resolved. He had said\r\nso, and that which he said was always true to the letter. But,\r\nnevertheless, when this thing which he still chose to pursue should\r\nhave been put absolutely beyond his reach, he would not allow his\r\ncalm bosom to be harassed by a vain regret. He was a man too whole at\r\nevery point,--so Alice told herself,--to allow his happiness to be\r\nmarred by such an accident.\r\n\r\nBut must the accident occur? Was there no chance that he might be\r\nsaved, even from such trouble as might follow upon such a loss?\r\nCould it not be possible that he might be gratified,--since it would\r\ngratify him,--and that she might be saved! Over and over again she\r\nconsidered this,--but always as though it were another woman whom she\r\nwould fain save, and not herself.\r\n\r\nBut she knew that her own fate was fixed. She had been mad when she\r\nhad done the thing, but the thing was not on that account the less\r\ndone. She had been mad when she had trusted herself abroad with\r\ntwo persons, both of whom, as she had well known, were intent on\r\nwrenching her happiness from out of her grasp. She had been mad when\r\nshe had told herself, whilst walking over the Westmoreland fells,\r\nthat after all she might as well marry her cousin, since that other\r\nmarriage was then beyond her reach! Her two cousins had succeeded in\r\nblighting all the hopes of her life;--but what could she now think\r\nof herself in that she had been so weak as to submit to such usage\r\nfrom their hands? Alas!--she told herself, admitting in her misery\r\nall her weakness,--alas, she had no mother. She had gloried in her\r\nindependence, and this had come of it! She had scorned the prudence\r\nof Lady Macleod, and her scorn had brought her to this pass!\r\n\r\nWas she to give herself bodily,--body and soul, as she said aloud in\r\nher solitary agony,--to a man whom she did not love? Must she submit\r\nto his caresses,--lie on his bosom,--turn herself warmly to his\r\nkisses? "No," she said, "no,"--speaking audibly, as she walked about\r\nthe room; "no;--it was not in my bargain; I never meant it." But if\r\nso what had she meant;--what had been her dream? Of what marriage had\r\nshe thought, when she was writing that letter back to George Vavasor?\r\nHow am I to analyse her mind, and make her thoughts and feelings\r\nintelligible to those who may care to trouble themselves with the\r\nstudy? Any sacrifice she would make for her cousin which one friend\r\ncould make for another. She would fight his battles with her money,\r\nwith her words, with her sympathy. She would sit with him if he\r\nneeded it, and speak comfort to him by the hour. His disgrace should\r\nbe her disgrace;--his glory her glory;--his pursuits her pursuits.\r\nWas not that the marriage to which she had consented? But he had come\r\nto her and asked her for a kiss, and she had shuddered before him,\r\nwhen he made the demand. Then that other one had come and had touched\r\nher hand, and the fibres of her body had seemed to melt within her at\r\nthe touch, so that she could have fallen at his feet.\r\n\r\nShe had done very wrong. She knew that she had done wrong. She knew\r\nthat she had sinned with that sin which specially disgraces a woman.\r\nShe had said that she would become the wife of a man to whom she\r\ncould not cleave with a wife\'s love; and, mad with a vile ambition,\r\nshe had given up the man for whose modest love her heart was longing.\r\nShe had thrown off from her that wondrous aroma of precious delicacy,\r\nwhich is the greatest treasure of womanhood. She had sinned against\r\nher sex; and, in an agony of despair, as she crouched down upon the\r\nfloor with her head against her chair, she told herself that there\r\nwas no pardon for her. She understood it now, and knew that she could\r\nnot forgive herself.\r\n\r\nBut can you forgive her, delicate reader? Or am I asking the question\r\ntoo early in my story? For myself, I have forgiven her. The story of\r\nthe struggle has been present to my mind for many years,--and I have\r\nlearned to think that even this offence against womanhood may, with\r\ndeep repentance, be forgiven. And you also must forgive her before we\r\nclose the book, or else my story will have been told amiss.\r\n\r\nBut let us own that she had sinned,--almost damnably, almost past\r\nforgiveness. What;--think that she knew what love meant, and not know\r\nwhich of two she loved! What;--doubt, of two men for whose arms she\r\nlonged, of which the kisses would be sweet to bear; on which side lay\r\nthe modesty of her maiden love! Faugh! She had submitted to pollution\r\nof heart and feeling before she had brought herself to such a pass as\r\nthis. Come;--let us see if it be possible that she may be cleansed by\r\nthe fire of her sorrow.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do?" She passed that whole day in asking herself that\r\nquestion. She was herself astounded at the rapidity with which the\r\nconviction had forced itself upon her that a marriage with her cousin\r\nwould be to her almost impossible; and could she permit it to be\r\nsaid of her that she had thrice in her career jilted a promised\r\nsuitor,--that three times she would go back from her word because\r\nher fancy had changed? Where could she find the courage to tell her\r\nfather, to tell Kate, to tell even George himself, that her purpose\r\nwas again altered? But she had a year at her disposal. If only during\r\nthat year he would take her money and squander it, and then require\r\nnothing further of her hands, might she not thus escape the doom\r\nbefore her? Might it not be possible that the refusal should this\r\ntime come from him? But she succeeded in making one resolve. She\r\nthought at least that she succeeded. Come what might, she would never\r\nstand with him at the altar. While there was a cliff from which she\r\nmight fall, water that would cover her, a death-dealing grain that\r\nmight be mixed in her cup, she could not submit herself to be George\r\nVavasor\'s wife. To no ear could she tell of this resolve. To no\r\nfriend could she hint her purpose. She owed her money to the man\r\nafter what had passed between them. It was his right to count upon\r\nsuch assistance as that would give him, and he should have it. Only\r\nas his betrothed she could give it him, for she understood well that\r\nif there were any breach between them, his accepting of such aid\r\nwould be impossible. He should have her money, and then, when the day\r\ncame, some escape should be found.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon her father came to her, and it may be as well to\r\nexplain that Mr. Grey had seen him again that day. Mr. Grey, when\r\nhe left Queen Anne Street, had gone to his lawyer, and from thence\r\nhad made his way to Mr. Vavasor. It was between five and six when\r\nMr. Vavasor came back to his house, and he then found his daughter\r\nsitting over the drawing-room fire, without lights, in the gloom\r\nof the evening. Mr. Vavasor had returned with Grey to the lawyer\'s\r\nchambers, and had from thence come direct to his own house. He had\r\nbeen startled at the precision with which all the circumstances\r\nof his daughter\'s position had been explained to a mild-eyed old\r\ngentleman, with a bald head, who carried on his business in a narrow,\r\ndark, clean street, behind Doctors\' Commons. Mr. Tombe was his name.\r\n"No;" Mr. Grey had said, when Mr. Vavasor had asked as to the peculiar\r\nnature of Mr. Tombe\'s business; "he is not specially an ecclesiastical\r\nlawyer. He had a partner at Ely, and was always employed by my\r\nfather, and by most of the clergy there." Mr. Tombe had evinced no\r\nsurprise, no dismay, and certainly no mock delicacy, when the whole\r\naffair was under discussion. George Vavasor was to get present\r\nmoneys, but,--if it could be so arranged--from John Grey\'s stores\r\nrather than from those belonging to Alice. Mr. Tombe could probably\r\narrange that with Mr. Vavasor\'s lawyer, who would no doubt be able to\r\nmake difficulty as to raising ready money. Mr. Tombe would be able\r\nto raise ready money without difficulty. And then, at last, George\r\nVavasor was to be made to surrender his bride, taking or having taken\r\nthe price of his bargain. John Vavasor sat by in silence as the\r\narrangement was being made, not knowing how to speak. He had no money\r\nwith which to give assistance. "I wish you to understand from the\r\nlady\'s father," Grey said to the lawyer, "that the marriage would be\r\nregarded by him with as much dismay as by myself."\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--it would be ruinous," Mr. Vavasor had answered.\r\n\r\n"And you see, Mr. Tombe," Mr. Grey went on, "we only wish to try the\r\nman. If he be not such as we believe him to be, he can prove it by\r\nhis conduct. If he is worthy of her, he can then take her."\r\n\r\n"You merely wish to open her eyes, Mr. Grey," said the mild-eyed\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n"I wish that he should have what money he wants, and then we shall\r\nfind what it is he really wishes."\r\n\r\n"Yes; we shall know our man," said the lawyer. "He shall have the\r\nmoney, Mr. Grey," and so the interview had been ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor, when he entered the drawing-room, addressed his daughter\r\nin a cheery voice. "What; all in the dark?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa. Why should I have candles when I am doing nothing? I did\r\nnot expect you."\r\n\r\n"No; I suppose not. I came here because I want to say a few words to\r\nyou about business."\r\n\r\n"What business, papa?" Alice well understood the tone of her father\'s\r\nvoice. He was desirous of propitiating her; but was at the same time\r\ndesirous of carrying some point in which he thought it probable that\r\nshe would oppose him.\r\n\r\n"Well; my love, if I understood you rightly, your cousin George wants\r\nsome money."\r\n\r\n"I did not say that he wants it now; but I think he will want it\r\nbefore the time for the election comes."\r\n\r\n"If so, he will want it at once. He has not asked you for it yet?"\r\n\r\n"No; he has merely said that should he be in need he would take me at\r\nmy word."\r\n\r\n"I think there is no doubt that he wants it. Indeed, I believe that\r\nhe is almost entirely without present means of his own."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly think so; but I have no knowledge about it. I can only\r\nsay that he has not asked me yet, and that I should wish to oblige\r\nhim whenever he may do so."\r\n\r\n"To what extent, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I have. I get about four hundred a year, but I\r\ndo not know what it is worth, or how far it can all be turned into\r\nmoney. I should wish to keep a hundred a year and let him have the\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"What; eight thousand pounds!" said the father who in spite of his\r\nwish not to oppose her, could not but express his dismay.\r\n\r\n"I do not imagine that he will want so much; but if he should, I wish\r\nthat he should have it."\r\n\r\n"Heaven and earth!" said John Vavasor. "Of course we should have to\r\ngive up the house." He could not suppress his trouble, or refrain\r\nfrom bursting out in agony at the prospect of such a loss.\r\n\r\n"But he has asked me for nothing yet, papa."\r\n\r\n"No, exactly; and perhaps he may not; but I wish to know what to do\r\nwhen the demand is made. I am not going to oppose you now; your money\r\nis your own, and you have a right to do with it as you please;--but\r\nwould you gratify me in one thing?"\r\n\r\n"What is it, papa?"\r\n\r\n"When he does apply, let the amount be raised through me?"\r\n\r\n"How through you?"\r\n\r\n"Come to me; I mean, so that I may see the lawyer, and have the\r\narrangements made." Then he explained to her that in dealing with\r\nlarge sums of money, it could not be right that she should do so\r\nwithout his knowledge, even though the property was her own. "I will\r\npromise you that I will not oppose your wishes," he said. Then Alice\r\nundertook that when such case should arise the money should be raised\r\nthrough his means.\r\n\r\nThe day but one following this she received a letter from Lady\r\nGlencora, who was still at Matching Priory. It was a light-spirited,\r\nchatty, amusing letter, intended to be happy in its tone,--intended\r\nto have a flavour of happiness, but just failing through the too\r\napparent meaning of a word here and there. "You will see that I am at\r\nMatching," the letter said, "whereas you will remember that I was to\r\nhave been at Monkshade. I escaped at last by a violent effort, and\r\nam now passing my time innocently,--I fear not so profitably as she\r\nwould induce me to do,--with Iphy Palliser. You remember Iphy. She is\r\na good creature, and would fain turn even me to profit, if it were\r\npossible. I own that I am thinking of them all at Monkshade, and\r\nam in truth delighted that I am not there. My absence is entirely\r\nlaid upon your shoulders. That wicked evening amidst the ruins! Poor\r\nruins. I go there alone sometimes and fancy that I hear such voices\r\nfrom the walls, and see such faces through the broken windows! All\r\nthe old Pallisers come and frown at me, and tell me that I am not\r\ngood enough to belong to them. There is a particular window to which\r\nSir Guy comes and makes faces at me. I told Iphy the other day, and\r\nshe answered me very gravely, that I might, if I chose, make myself\r\ngood enough for the Pallisers. Even for the Pallisers! Isn\'t that\r\nbeautiful?"\r\n\r\nThen Lady Glencora went on to say, that her husband intended to come\r\nup to London early in the session, and that she would accompany him.\r\n"That is," added Lady Glencora, "if I am still good enough for the\r\nPallisers at that time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Inn at Shap.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George Vavasor left Mr. Scruby\'s office--the attentive reader\r\nwill remember that he did call upon Mr. Scruby, the Parliamentary\r\nlawyer, and there recognised the necessity of putting himself\r\nin possession of a small sum of money with as little delay as\r\npossible;--when he left the attorney\'s office, he was well aware that\r\nthe work to be done was still before him. And he knew also that the\r\njob to be undertaken was a very disagreeable job. He did not like the\r\ntask of borrowing his cousin Alice\'s money.\r\n\r\nWe all of us know that swindlers and rogues do very dirty tricks,\r\nand we are apt to picture to ourselves a certain amount of gusto\r\nand delight on the part of the swindlers in the doing of them. In\r\nthis, I think we are wrong. The poor, broken, semi-genteel beggar,\r\nwho borrows half-sovereigns apiece from all his old acquaintances,\r\nknowing that they know that he will never repay them, suffers a\r\nseparate little agony with each petition that he makes. He does not\r\nenjoy pleasant sailing in this journey which he is making. To be\r\nrefused is painful to him. To get his half sovereign with scorn is\r\npainful. To get it with apparent confidence in his honour is almost\r\nmore painful. "D---- it," he says to himself on such rare occasions,\r\n"I will pay that fellow;" and yet, as he says it, he knows that he\r\nnever will pay even that fellow. It is a comfortless unsatisfying\r\ntrade, that of living upon other people\'s money.\r\n\r\nHow was George Vavasor to make his first step towards getting his\r\nhand into his cousin\'s purse? He had gone to her asking for her\r\nlove, and she had shuddered when he asked her. That had been the\r\ncommencement of their life under their new engagement. He knew very\r\nwell that the money would be forthcoming when he demanded it,--but\r\nunder their present joint circumstances, how was he to make the\r\ndemand? If he wrote to her, should he simply ask for money, and make\r\nno allusion to his love? If he went to her in person, should he make\r\nhis visit a mere visit of business,--as he might call on his banker?\r\n\r\nHe resolved at last that Kate should do the work for him. Indeed,\r\nhe had felt all along that it would be well that Kate should act as\r\nambassador between him and Alice in money matters, as she had long\r\ndone in other things. He could talk to Kate as he could not talk to\r\nAlice;--and then, between the women, those hard money necessities\r\nwould be softened down by a romantic phraseology which he would not\r\nhimself know how to use with any effect. He made up his mind to see\r\nKate, and with this view he went down to Westmoreland; and took\r\nhimself to a small wayside inn at Shap among the fells, which had\r\nbeen known to him of old. He gave his sister notice that he would be\r\nthere, and begged her to come over to him as early as she might find\r\nit possible on the morning after his arrival. He himself reached the\r\nplace late in the evening by train from London. There is a station\r\nat Shap, by which the railway company no doubt conceives that it\r\nhas conferred on that somewhat rough and remote locality all the\r\nadvantages of a refined civilization; but I doubt whether the\r\nShappites have been thankful for the favour. The landlord at the inn,\r\nfor one, is not thankful. Shap had been a place owing all such life\r\nas it had possessed to coaching and posting. It had been a stage on\r\nthe high road from Lancaster to Carlisle, and though it lay high\r\nand bleak among the fells, and was a cold, windy, thinly-populated\r\nplace,--filling all travellers with thankfulness that they had not\r\nbeen made Shappites, nevertheless, it had had its glory in its\r\ncoaching and posting. I have no doubt that there are men and women\r\nwho look back with a fond regret to the palmy days of Shap.\r\n\r\nVavasor reached the little inn about nine in the evening on a night\r\nthat was pitchy dark, and in a wind which made it necessary for him\r\nto hold his hat on to his head. "What a beastly country to live in,"\r\nhe said to himself, resolving that he would certainly sell Vavasor\r\nHall in spite of all family associations, if ever the power to do so\r\nshould be his. "What trash it is," he said, "hanging on to such a\r\nplace as that without the means of living like a gentleman, simply\r\nbecause one\'s ancestors have done so." And then he expressed a\r\ndoubt to himself whether all the world contained a more ignorant,\r\nopinionated, useless old man than his grandfather,--or, in short, a\r\ngreater fool.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. George," said the landlord as soon as he saw him, "a sight\r\nof you\'s guid for sair een. It\'s o\'er lang since you\'ve been doon\r\namang the fells." But George did not want to converse with the\r\ninnkeeper, or to explain how it was that he did not visit Vavasor\r\nHall. The innkeeper, no doubt, knew all about it,--knew that the\r\ngrandfather had quarrelled with his grandson, and knew the reason\r\nwhy; but George, if he suspected such knowledge, did not choose to\r\nrefer to it. So he simply grunted something in reply, and getting\r\nhimself in before a spark of fire which hardly was burning in a\r\npublic room with a sandy floor, begged that the little sitting-room\r\nup-stairs might be got ready for him. There he passed the evening in\r\nsolitude, giving no encouragement to the landlord, who, nevertheless,\r\nlooked him up three or four times,--till at last George said that his\r\nhead ached, and that he would wish to be alone. "He was always one of\r\nthem cankery chiels as never have a kindly word for man nor beast,"\r\nsaid the landlord. "Seems as though that raw slash in his face had\r\ngone right through into his heart." After that George was left alone,\r\nand sat thinking whether it would not be better to ask Alice for two\r\nthousand pounds at once,--so as to save him from the disagreeable\r\nnecessity of a second borrowing before their marriage. He was very\r\nuneasy in his mind. He had flattered himself through it all that his\r\ncousin had loved him. He had felt sure that such was the case while\r\nthey were together in Switzerland. When she had determined to give\r\nup John Grey, of course he had told himself the same thing. When she\r\nhad at once answered his first subsequent overture with an assent, he\r\nhad of course been certain that it was so. Dark, selfish, and even\r\ndishonest as he was, he had, nevertheless, enjoyed something of a\r\nlover\'s true pleasure in believing that Alice had still loved him\r\nthrough all their mischances. But his joy had in a moment been turned\r\ninto gall during that interview in Queen Anne Street. He had read the\r\ntruth at a glance. A man must be very vain, or else very little used\r\nto such matters, who at George Vavasor\'s age cannot understand the\r\nfeelings with which a woman receives him. When Alice contrived as she\r\nhad done to escape the embrace he was so well justified in asking, he\r\nknew the whole truth. He was sore at heart, and very angry withal.\r\nHe could have readily spurned her from him, and rejected her who had\r\nonce rejected him. He would have done so had not his need for her\r\nmoney restrained him. He was not a man who could deceive himself in\r\nsuch matters. He knew that this was so, and he told himself that he\r\nwas a rascal.\r\n\r\nVavasor Hall was, by the road, about five miles from Shap, and it\r\nwas not altogether an easy task for Kate to get over to the village\r\nwithout informing her grandfather that the visit was to be made, and\r\nwhat was its purport. She could, indeed, walk, and the walk would not\r\nbe so long as that she had taken with Alice to Swindale fell;--but\r\nwalking to an inn on a high road, is not the same thing as walking\r\nto a point on a hill side over a lake. Had she been dirty, draggled,\r\nand wet through on Swindale fell, it would have simply been matter\r\nfor mirth; but her brother she knew would not have liked to see her\r\nenter the Lowther Arms at Shap in such a condition. It, therefore,\r\nbecame necessary that she should ask her grandfather to lend her the\r\njaunting car.\r\n\r\n"Where do you want to go?" he asked sharply. In such establishments\r\nas that at Vavasor Hall the family horse is generally used for double\r\nduties. Though he draws the lady of the house one day, he is not too\r\nproud to draw manure on the next. And it will always be found that\r\nthe master of the house gives a great preference to the manure over\r\nthe lady. The squire at Vavasor had come to do so to such an extent\r\nthat he regarded any application for the animal\'s services as an\r\nencroachment.\r\n\r\n"Only to Shap, grandpapa."\r\n\r\n"To Shap! what on earth can take you to Shap? There are no shops at\r\nShap."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to do shopping. I want to see some one there."\r\n\r\n"Whom can you want to see at Shap?"\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to Kate on the spur of the moment that she might as\r\nwell tell her grandfather the fact. "My brother has come down," she\r\nsaid; "and is at the inn there. I had not intended to tell you, as\r\nI did not wish to mention his name till you had consented to receive\r\nhim here."\r\n\r\n"And he expects to come here now;--does he?" said the squire.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir. I think he has no expectation of the kind. He has come\r\ndown simply to see me;--about business I believe."\r\n\r\n"Business! what business? I suppose he wants to get your money from\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I think it is with reference to his marriage. I think he wants me to\r\nuse my influence with Alice that it may not be delayed."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Kate; if ever you lend him your money, or any of\r\nit,--that is, of the principal I mean,--I will never speak to him\r\nagain under any circumstance. And more than that! Look here, Kate. In\r\nspite of all that has past and gone, the property will become his for\r\nhis life when I die,--unless I change my will. If he gets your money\r\nfrom you, I will change it, and he shall not be a shilling richer at\r\nmy death than he is now. You can have the horse to go to Shap."\r\n\r\nWhat unlucky chance had it been which had put this idea into the old\r\nsquire\'s head on this especial morning? Kate had resolved that she\r\nwould entreat her brother to make use of her little fortune. She\r\nfeared that he was now coming with some reference to his cousin\'s\r\nmoney,--that something was to be done to enable him to avail himself\r\nof his cousin\'s offer; and Kate, almost blushing in the solitude of\r\nher chamber at the thought, was determined that her brother must be\r\nsaved from such temptation. She knew that money was necessary to him.\r\nShe knew that he could not stand a second contest without assistance.\r\nWith all their confidences, he had never told her much of his\r\npecuniary circumstances in the world, but she was almost sure that he\r\nwas a poor man. He had said as much as that to her, and in his letter\r\ndesiring her to come to him at Shap, he had inserted a word or two\r\npurposely intended to prepare her mind for monetary considerations.\r\n\r\nAs she was jogged along over the rough road to Shap, she made up\r\nher mind that Aunt Greenow would be the proper person to defray\r\nthe expense of the coming election. To give Kate her due she would\r\nhave given up every shilling of her own money without a moment\'s\r\nhesitation, or any feeling that her brother would be wrong to accept\r\nit. Nor would she, perhaps, have been unalterably opposed to his\r\ntaking Alice\'s money, had Alice simply been his cousin. She felt that\r\nas Vavasors they were bound to stand by the future head of the family\r\nin an attempt which was to be made, as she felt, for the general\r\nVavasor interest. But she could not endure to think that her brother\r\nshould take the money of the girl whom he was engaged to marry. Aunt\r\nGreenow\'s money she thought was fair game. Aunt Greenow herself had\r\nmade various liberal offers to herself which Kate had declined, not\r\ncaring to be under pecuniary obligations even to Aunt Greenow without\r\nnecessity; but she felt that for such a purpose as her brother\'s\r\ncontest, she need not hesitate to ask for assistance, and she thought\r\nalso that such assistance would be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n"Grandpapa knows that you are here, George," said Kate, when their\r\nfirst greeting was over.\r\n\r\n"The deuce he does! and why did you tell him?"\r\n\r\n"I could not get the car to come in without letting him know why I\r\nwanted it."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! as if you couldn\'t have made any excuse! I was\r\nparticularly anxious that he should not guess that I am here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that it can make any difference, George."\r\n\r\n"But I see that it can,--a very great difference. It may prevent my\r\never being able to get near him again before he dies. What did he say\r\nabout my coming?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t say much."\r\n\r\n"He made no offer as to my going there?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I should not have gone if he had. I don\'t know now that I ever\r\nshall go. To be there to do any good,--so as to make him alter his\r\nwill, and leave me in the position which I have a right to expect,\r\nwould take more time than the whole property is worth. And he would\r\nendeavour to tie me down in some way I could not stand;--perhaps ask\r\nme to give up my notion for going into Parliament."\r\n\r\n"He might ask you, but he would not make it ground for another\r\nquarrel, if you refused."\r\n\r\n"He is so unreasonable and ignorant that I am better away from\r\nhim. But, Kate, you have not congratulated me on my matrimonial\r\nprospects."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I did, George, when I wrote to you."\r\n\r\n"Did you? well; I had forgotten. I don\'t know that any very strong\r\ncongratulatory tone is necessary. As things go, perhaps it may be as\r\nwell for all of us, and that\'s about the best that can be said for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"You see I\'m not romantic, Kate, as you are. Half a dozen children\r\nwith a small income do not generally present themselves as being\r\ndesirable to men who wish to push their way in the world."\r\n\r\n"You know you have always longed to make her your wife."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything of the kind. You have always been under a\r\nmatch-making hallucination on that point. But in this case you have\r\nbeen so far successful, and are entitled to your triumph."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any triumph; you ought to know that."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll tell you what I do want, Kate. I want some money." Then\r\nhe paused, but as she did not answer immediately, he was obliged to\r\ngo on speaking. "I\'m not at all sure that I have not been wrong in\r\nmaking this attempt to get into Parliament,--that I\'m not struggling\r\nto pick fruit which is above my reach."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, George."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I can\'t help feeling it. I need hardly tell you that I am\r\nready to risk anything of my own. If I know myself I would toss up\r\nto-morrow, or for the matter of that to-day, between the gallows and\r\na seat in the House. But I cannot go on with this contest by risking\r\nwhat is merely my own. Money, for immediate use, I have none left,\r\nand my neck, though I were ever so willing to risk it, is of no\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"Whatever I have can be yours to-morrow," said Kate, in a hesitating\r\nvoice, which too plainly pronounced her misery as she made the\r\noffer. She could not refrain herself from making it. Though her\r\ngrandfather\'s threat was ringing in her ears,--though she knew that\r\nshe might be ruining her brother by proposing such a loan, she had\r\nno alternative. When her brother told her of his want of money, she\r\ncould not abstain from tendering to him the use of what was her own.\r\n\r\n"No;" said he. "I shall not take your money."\r\n\r\n"You would not scruple, if you knew how welcome you are."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I shall not take it. I should not think it right. All\r\nthat you have would only just suffice for my present wants, and I\r\nshould not choose to make you a beggar. There would, moreover, be a\r\ndifficulty about readjusting the payment."\r\n\r\n"There would be no difficulty, because no one need be consulted but\r\nus two."\r\n\r\n"I should not think it right, and therefore let there be an end of\r\nit," said George in a tone of voice which had in it something of\r\nmagniloquence.\r\n\r\n"What is it you wish then?" said Kate, who knew too well what he did\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n"I will explain to you. When Alice and I are married, of course\r\nthere will be a settlement made on her, and as we are both the\r\ngrandchildren of the old squire I shall propose that the Vavasor\r\nproperty shall be hers for life in the event of her outliving me."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"And if this be done, there can be no harm in my forestalling some\r\nof her property, which, under the circumstances of such a settlement,\r\nwould of course become mine when we are married."\r\n\r\n"But the squire might leave the property to whom he pleases."\r\n\r\n"We know very well that he won\'t, at any rate, leave it out of the\r\nfamily. In fact, he would only be too glad to consent to such an\r\nagreement as that I have proposed, because he would thereby rob me of\r\nall power in the matter."\r\n\r\n"But that could not be done till you are married."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Kate;--don\'t you make difficulties." And now, as he\r\nlooked at her, the cicature on his face seemed to open and yawn at\r\nher. "If you mean to say that you won\'t help me, do say so, and I\r\nwill go back to London."\r\n\r\n"I would do anything in my power to help you,--that was not wrong!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; anybody could say as much as that. That is not much of an offer\r\nif you are to keep to yourself the power of deciding what is wrong.\r\nWill you write to Alice,--or better still, go to her, and explain\r\nthat I want the money."\r\n\r\n"How can I go to London now?"\r\n\r\n"You can do it very well, if you choose. But if that be too much,\r\nthen write to her. It will come much better from you than from me;\r\nwrite to her, and explain that I must pay in advance the expenses\r\nof this contest, and that I cannot look for success unless I do so.\r\nI did not think that the demand would come so quick on me; but they\r\nknow that I am not a man of capital, and therefore I cannot expect\r\nthem to carry on the fight for me, unless they know that the money is\r\nsure. Scruby has been bitten two or three times by these metropolitan\r\nfellows, and he is determined that he will not be bitten again." Then\r\nhe paused for Kate to speak.\r\n\r\n"George," she said, slowly.\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would try any other scheme but that."\r\n\r\n"There is no other scheme! That\'s so like a woman;--to quarrel with\r\nthe only plan that is practicable."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you ought to take Alice\'s money."\r\n\r\n"My dear Kate, you must allow me to be the best judge of what I ought\r\nto do, and what I ought not to do. Alice herself understands the\r\nmatter perfectly. She knows that I cannot obtain this position, which\r\nis as desirable for her as it is for me--"\r\n\r\n"And for me as much as for either," said Kate, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Alice, I say, knows that I cannot do this without money,\r\nand has offered the assistance which I want. I would rather that you\r\nshould tell her how much I want, and that I want it now, than that I\r\nshould do so. That is all. If you are half the woman that I take you\r\nto be, you will understand this well enough."\r\n\r\nKate did understand it well enough. She was quite awake to the fact\r\nthat her brother was ashamed of the thing he was about to do,--so\r\nmuch ashamed of it that he was desirous of using her voice instead\r\nof his own. "I want you to write to her quite at once," he continued;\r\n"since you seem to think that it is not worth while to take the\r\ntrouble of a journey to London."\r\n\r\n"There is no question about the trouble," said Kate. "I would walk to\r\nLondon to get the money for you, if that were all."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that Alice will refuse to lend it me?" said he, looking\r\ninto her face.\r\n\r\n"I am sure that she would not, but I think that you ought not to take\r\nit from her. There seems to me to be something sacred about property\r\nthat belongs to the girl you are going to marry."\r\n\r\n"If there is anything on earth I hate," said George, walking about\r\nthe room, "it is romance. If you keep it for reading in your bedroom,\r\nit\'s all very well for those who like it, but when it comes to be\r\nmixed up with one\'s business it plays the devil. If you would only\r\nsift what you have said, you would see what nonsense it is. Alice and\r\nI are to be man and wife. All our interests, and all our money, and\r\nour station in life, whatever it may be, are to be joint property.\r\nAnd yet she is the last person in the world to whom I ought to go for\r\nmoney to improve her prospects as well as my own. That\'s what you\r\ncall delicacy. I call it infernal nonsense."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what I\'ll do, George. I\'ll ask Aunt Greenow to lend you\r\nthe money,--or to lend it to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe she\'d give me a shilling. Moreover, I want it quite\r\nimmediately, and the time taken up in letter-writing and negotiations\r\nwould be fatal to me. If you won\'t apply to Alice, I must. I want you\r\nto tell me whether you will oblige me in this matter."\r\n\r\nKate was still hesitating as to her answer, when there came a knock\r\nat the door, and a little crumpled note was brought up to her. A boy\r\nhad just come with it across the fell from Vavasor Hall, and Kate, as\r\nsoon as she saw her name on the outside, knew that it was from her\r\ngrandfather. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "If George wishes to come to the Hall, let him come. If\r\n   he chooses to tell me that he regrets his conduct to me,\r\n   I will see him."\r\n\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said George. Then Kate put the note into her brother\'s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do nothing of the kind," he said. "What good should I get by\r\ngoing to the old man\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"Every good," said Kate. "If you don\'t go now you never can do so."\r\n\r\n"Never till it\'s my own," said George.\r\n\r\n"If you show him that you are determined to be at variance with him,\r\nit never will be your own;--unless, indeed, it should some day come\r\nto you as part of Alice\'s fortune. Think of it, George; you would not\r\nlike to receive everything from her."\r\n\r\nHe walked about the room, muttering maledictions between his teeth\r\nand balancing, as best he was able at such a moment, his pride\r\nagainst his profit. "You haven\'t answered my question," said he. "If\r\nI go to the Hall, will you write to Alice?"\r\n\r\n"No, George; I cannot write to Alice asking her for the money."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"I could not bring myself to do it."\r\n\r\n"Then, Kate, you and my grandfather may work together for the future.\r\nYou may get him to leave you the place if you have skill enough."\r\n\r\n"That is as undeserved a reproach as any woman ever encountered,"\r\nsaid Kate, standing her ground boldly before him. "If you have either\r\nheart or conscience, you will feel that it is so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much troubled with either one or the other, I fancy. Things\r\nare being brought to such a pass with me that I am better without\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Will you take my money, George; just for the present?"\r\n\r\n"No. I haven\'t much conscience; but I have a little left."\r\n\r\n"Will you let me write to Mrs. Greenow?"\r\n\r\n"I have not the slightest objection; but it will be of no use\r\nwhatsoever."\r\n\r\n"I will do so, at any rate. And now will you come to the Hall?"\r\n\r\n"To beg that old fool\'s pardon? No; I won\'t. In the mood I am in at\r\npresent, I couldn\'t do it. I should only anger him worse than ever.\r\nTell him that I\'ve business which calls me back to London at once."\r\n\r\n"It is a thousand pities."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\n"It may make so great a difference to you for your whole life!" urged\r\nKate.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," said George. "I\'ll go to Vavasor\r\nand put up with the old squire\'s insolence, if you\'ll make this\r\napplication for me to Alice." I wonder whether it occurred to him\r\nthat his sister desired his presence at the Hall solely on his own\r\nbehalf. The same idea certainly did not occur to Kate. She hesitated,\r\nfeeling that she would almost do anything to achieve a reconciliation\r\nbetween her grandfather and her brother.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll let me write to Aunt Greenow first," said she. "It will\r\ntake only two days,--or at the most three?"\r\n\r\nTo this George consented as though he were yielding a great deal;\r\nand Kate, with a sore conscience, with a full knowledge that she was\r\nundertaking to do wrong, promised that she would apply to Alice for\r\nher money, if sufficient funds should not be forthcoming from Mrs.\r\nGreenow. Thereupon, George graciously consented to proceed to his\r\nbedroom, and put together his clothes with a view to his visit to the\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n"I thank Providence, Kate, that circumstances make it impossible for\r\nme to stay above two days. I have not linen to last me longer."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll manage that for you at the Hall."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you won\'t do anything of the kind. And look, Kate, when I\r\nmake that excuse don\'t you offer to do so. I will stay there over\r\nto-morrow night, and shall go into Kendal early, so as to catch the\r\nexpress train up on Thursday morning. Don\'t you throw me over by any\r\ncounter proposition."\r\n\r\nThen they started together in the car, and very few words were said\r\ntill they reached the old lodge, which stood at the entrance to the\r\nplace. "Eh, Mr. George; be that you?" said the old woman, who came out\r\nto swing back for them the broken gate. "A sight of you is good for\r\nsair een." It was the same welcome that the inn-keeper had given him,\r\nand equally sincere. George had never made himself popular about the\r\nplace, but he was the heir.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you had better go into the drawing-room," said Kate;\r\n"while I go to my grandfather. You won\'t find a fire there."\r\n\r\n"Manage it how you please; but don\'t keep me in the cold very long.\r\nHeavens, what a country house! The middle of January, and no fires in\r\nthe room."\r\n\r\n"And remember, George, when you see him you must say that you regret\r\nthat you ever displeased him. Now that you are here, don\'t let there\r\nbe any further misunderstanding."\r\n\r\n"I think it very probable that there will be," said George. "I only\r\nhope he\'ll let me have the old horse to take me back to Shap if there\r\nis. There he is at the front door, so I shan\'t have to go into the\r\nroom without a fire."\r\n\r\nThe old man was standing at the hall steps when the car drove up, as\r\nthough to welcome his grandson. He put out his hand to help Kate down\r\nthe steps, keeping his eye all the time on George\'s face.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve come back," the squire said to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "So you\'ve come back, have you?" said the Squire.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir;--I\'ve come back, like the prodigal son in the parable."\r\n\r\n"The prodigal son was contrite. I hope you are so."\r\n\r\n"Pretty well for that, sir. I\'m sorry there has been any quarrel, and\r\nall that, you know."\r\n\r\n"Go in," said the squire, very angrily. "Go in. To expect anything\r\ngracious from you would be to expect pearls from swine. Go in."\r\n\r\nGeorge went in, shrugging his shoulders as his eyes met his sister\'s.\r\nIt was in this fashion that the reconciliation took place between\r\nSquire Vavasor and his heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre\'s Hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the winter wore itself away, Mr. Cheesacre, happy as he was amidst\r\nthe sports of Norfolk, and prosperous as he might be with the augean\r\nspoils of Oileymead, fretted himself with an intense anxiety to bring\r\nto a close that affair which he had on his hands with the widow\r\nGreenow. There were two special dangers which disturbed him. She\r\nwould give herself and all her money to that adventurer, Bellfield;\r\nor else she would spend her own money so fast before he got hold upon\r\nit, that the prize would be greatly damaged. "I\'m ---- if she hasn\'t\r\nbeen and set up a carriage!" he said to himself one day, as standing\r\non the pavement of Tombland, in Norwich, he saw Mrs. Greenow issue\r\nforth from the Close in a private brougham, accompanied by one of the\r\nFairstairs girls. "She\'s been and set up her carriage as sure as my\r\nname\'s Cheesacre!"\r\n\r\nWhatever reason he might have to fear the former danger, we may\r\ndeclare that he had none whatever as to the latter. Mrs. Greenow knew\r\nwhat she was doing with her money as well as any lady in England. The\r\nprivate carriage was only a hired brougham taken by the month, and as\r\nto that boy in buttons whom she had lately established, why should\r\nshe not keep a young servant, and call him a page, if it gave her any\r\ncomfort to do so? If Mr. Cheesacre had also known that she had lent\r\nthe Fairstairs family fifty pounds to help them through with some\r\ndifficulty which Joe had encountered with the Norwich tradespeople,\r\nhe would have been beside himself with dismay. He desired to obtain\r\nthe prize unmutilated,--in all its fair proportions. Any such\r\nclippings he regarded as robberies against himself.\r\n\r\nBut he feared Bellfield more than he feared the brougham. That\r\nall is fair in love and war was no doubt, at this period, Captain\r\nBellfield\'s maxim, and we can only trust that he found in it some\r\nconsolation, or ease to his conscience, in regard to the monstrous\r\nlies which he told his friend. In war, no doubt, all stratagems are\r\nfair. The one general is quite justified in making the other believe\r\nthat he is far to the right, when in truth he is turning his enemy\'s\r\nleft flank. If successful, he will be put upon a pedestal for his\r\nclever deceit, and crowned with laurels because of his lie. If\r\nBellfield could only be successful, and achieve for himself the\r\nmastery over those forty thousand pounds, the world would forgive him\r\nand place, on his brow also, some not uncomfortable crown. In the\r\nmean time, his stratagems were as deep and his lies as profound as\r\nthose of any general.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Cheesacre ever believed him. In the\r\nfirst place, he knew that Bellfield was not a man to be believed\r\nin any way. Had he not been living on lies for the last ten years?\r\nBut then a man may lie in such a way as to deceive, though no one\r\nbelieve him. Mr. Cheesacre was kept in an agony of doubt while Captain\r\nBellfield occupied his lodgings in Norwich. He fee\'d Jeannette\r\nliberally. He even fee\'d Charlie Fairstairs,--Miss Fairstairs I\r\nmean,--with gloves, and chickens from Oileymead, so that he might\r\nknow whether that kite fluttered about his dovecoat, and of what\r\nnature were the flutterings. He went even further than this, and\r\nfee\'d the Captain himself,--binding him down not to flutter as\r\nvalue given in return for such fees. He attempted even to fee the\r\nwidow,--cautioning her against the fluttering, as he tendered to\r\nher, on his knees, a brooch as big as a breast-plate. She waved aside\r\nthe breast-plate, declaring that the mourning ring which contained\r\npoor Greenow\'s final grey lock of hair, was the last article from a\r\njeweller\'s shop which should ever find a place about her person. At\r\nthe same time she declared that Captain Bellfield was nothing to her;\r\nMr. Cheesacre need have no fears in that quarter. But then, she added,\r\nneither was he to have any hope. Her affections were all buried under\r\nthe cold sod. This was harassing. Nevertheless, though no absolute\r\nsatisfaction was to be attained in the wooing of Mrs. Greenow, there\r\nwas a pleasantness in the occupation which ought to have reconciled\r\nher suitors to their destiny. With most ladies, when a gentleman has\r\nbeen on his knees before one of them in the morning, with outspoken\r\nprotestations of love, with clearly defined proffers of marriage,\r\nwith a minute inventory of the offerer\'s worldly wealth,--down even\r\nto the "mahogany-furnitured" bed-chambers, as was the case with\r\nMr. Cheesacre, and when all these overtures have been peremptorily\r\ndeclined,--a gentleman in such a case, I say, would generally feel\r\nsome awkwardness in sitting down to tea with the lady at the close\r\nof such a performance. But with Mrs. Greenow there was no such\r\nawkwardness. After an hour\'s work of the nature above described she\r\nwould play the hostess with a genial hospitality, that eased off\r\nall the annoyance of disappointment; and then at the end of the\r\nevening, she would accept a squeeze of the hand, a good, palpable,\r\nlong-protracted squeeze, with that sort of "don\'t;--have done now,"\r\nby which Irish young ladies allure their lovers. Mr. Cheesacre, on\r\nsuch occasions, would leave the Close, swearing that she should be\r\nhis on the next market-day,--or at any rate, on the next Saturday.\r\nThen, on the Monday, tidings would reach him that Bellfield had\r\npassed all Sunday afternoon with his lady-love,--Bellfield, to whom\r\nhe had lent five pounds on purpose that he might be enabled to\r\nspend that very Sunday with some officers of the Suffolk volunteers\r\nat Ipswich. And hearing this, he would walk out among those rich\r\nheaps, at the back of his farmyard, uttering deep curses against the\r\nfalsehood of men and the fickleness of women.\r\n\r\nDriven to despair, he at last resolved to ask Bellfield to come to\r\nOileymead for a month. That drilling at Norwich, or the part of it\r\nwhich was supposed to be profitable, was wearing itself out. Funds\r\nwere low with the Captain,--as he did not scruple to tell his friend\r\nCheesacre, and he accepted the invitation. "I\'ll mount you with the\r\nharriers, old fellow," Cheesacre had said; "and give you a little\r\nshooting. Only I won\'t have you go out when I\'m not with you."\r\nBellfield agreed, Each of them understood the nature of the bargain;\r\nthough Bellfield, I think, had somewhat the clearer understanding\r\nin the matter. He would not be so near the widow as he had been at\r\nNorwich, but he would not be less near than his kind host. And his\r\nhost would no doubt watch him closely;--but then he also could watch\r\nhis host. There was a railway station not two miles from Oileymead,\r\nand the journey thence into Norwich was one of half an hour. Mr.\r\nCheesacre would doubtless be very jealous of such journeys, but with\r\nall his jealousy he could not prevent them. And then, in regard\r\nto this arrangement, Mr. Cheesacre paid the piper, whereas Captain\r\nBellfield paid nothing. Would it not be sweet to him if he could\r\ncarry off his friend\'s prize from under the very eaves of his\r\nfriend\'s house?\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Greenow also understood the arrangement. "Going to Oileymead;\r\nare you?" she said when Captain Bellfield came to tell her of his\r\ndeparture. Charlie Fairstairs was with her, so that the Captain could\r\nnot utilize the moment in any special way. "It\'s quite delightful,"\r\ncontinued the widow, "to see how fond you two gentlemen are of each\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"I think gentlemen always like to go best to gentlemen\'s houses where\r\nthere are no ladies," said Charlie Fairstairs, whose career in life\r\nhad not as yet been satisfactory to her.\r\n\r\n"As for that," said Bellfield, "I wish with all my heart that dear\r\nold Cheesy would get a wife. He wants a wife badly, if ever a man\r\ndid, with all that house full of blankets and crockery. Why don\'t you\r\nset your cap at him, Miss Fairstairs?"\r\n\r\n"What;--at a farmer!" said Charlie who was particularly anxious that\r\nher dear friend, Mrs. Greenow, should not marry Mr. Cheesacre, and who\r\nweakly thought to belittle him accordingly.\r\n\r\n"Give him my kind love," said Mrs. Greenow, thereby resenting the\r\nimpotent interference. "And look here, Captain Bellfield, suppose you\r\nboth dine with me next Saturday. He always comes in on Saturday, and\r\nyou might as well come too."\r\n\r\nCaptain Bellfield declared that he would only be too happy.\r\n\r\n"And Charlie shall come to set her cap at Mr. Cheesacre," said the\r\nwidow, turning a soft and gracious eye on the Captain.\r\n\r\n"I shall be happy to come,"--said Charlie, quite delighted; "but\r\nnot with that object. Mr. Cheesacre is very respectable, I\'m sure."\r\nCharlie\'s mother had been the daughter of a small squire who had\r\nlet his land to tenants, and she was, therefore, justified by\r\ncircumstances in looking down upon a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe matter was so settled,--pending the consent of Mr. Cheesacre; and\r\nBellfield went out to Oileymead. He knew the ways of the house, and\r\nwas not surprised to find himself left alone till after dusk; nor was\r\nhe much surprised when he learned that he was not put into one of the\r\nmahogany-furnitured chambers, but into a back room looking over the\r\nfarm-yard in which there was no fire-place. The Captain had already\r\nendured some of the evils of poverty, and could have put up with this\r\neasily had nothing been said about it. As it was, Cheesacre brought\r\nthe matter forward, and apologized, and made the thing difficult.\r\n\r\n"You see, old fellow," he said, "there are the rooms, and of course\r\nthey\'re empty. But it\'s such a bore hauling out all the things and\r\nputting up the curtains. You\'ll be very snug where you are."\r\n\r\n"I shall do very well," said Bellfield rather sulkily.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll do very well. It\'s the warmest room in the house in\r\none way." He did not say in what way. Perhaps the near neighbourhood\r\nof the stables may have had a warming effect.\r\n\r\nBellfield did not like it; but what is a poor man to do under such\r\ncircumstances? So he went up-stairs and washed his hands before\r\ndinner in the room without a fire-place, flattering himself that he\r\nwould yet be even with his friend Cheesacre.\r\n\r\nThey dined together not in the best humour, and after dinner they\r\nsat down to enjoy themselves with pipes and brandy and water.\r\nBellfield, having a taste for everything that was expensive, would\r\nhave preferred cigars; but his friend put none upon the table. Mr.\r\nCheesacre, though he could spend his money liberally when occasion\r\nrequired such spending, knew well the value of domestic economy. He\r\nwasn\'t going to put himself out, as he called it, for Bellfield! What\r\nwas good enough for himself was good enough for Bellfield. "A beggar,\r\nyou know; just a regular beggar!" as he was betrayed into saying\r\nto Mrs. Greenow on some occasion just at this period. "Poor fellow!\r\nHe only wants money to make him almost perfect," Mrs. Greenow had\r\nanswered;--and Mr. Cheesacre had felt that he had made a mistake.\r\n\r\nBoth the men became talkative, if not good-humoured, under the\r\neffects of the brandy and water, and the Captain then communicated\r\nMrs. Greenow\'s invitation to Mr. Cheesacre. He had had his doubts as\r\nto the propriety of doing so,--thinking that perhaps it might be to\r\nhis advantage to forget the message. But he reflected that he was\r\nat any rate a match for Cheesacre when they were present together,\r\nand finally came to the conclusion that the message should be\r\ndelivered. "I had to go and just wish her goodbye you know," he said\r\napologetically, as he finished his little speech.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear fellow, how foolishly jealous you are. If I were to be\r\ndownright uncivil to her, as you would have me be, it would only call\r\nattention to the thing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bit jealous. A man who sits upon his own ground as I do\r\nhasn\'t any occasion to be jealous."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what your own ground has to do with it,--but we\'ll let\r\nthat pass."\r\n\r\n"I think it has a great deal to do with it. If a man does intend to\r\nmarry he ought to have things comfortable about him; unless he wants\r\nto live on his wife, which I look upon as about the meanest thing a\r\nman can do. By George, I\'d sooner break stones than that."\r\n\r\nThis was hard for any captain to bear,--even for Captain Bellfield;\r\nbut he did bear it,--looking forward to revenge.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no pleasing you, I know," said he. "But there\'s the fact.\r\nI went to say goodbye to her, and she asked me to give you that\r\nmessage. Shall we go or not?"\r\n\r\nCheesacre sat for some time silent, blowing out huge clouds of\r\nsmoke while he meditated a little plan. "I\'ll tell you what it is,\r\nBellfield," he said at last. "She\'s nothing to you, and if you won\'t\r\nmind it, I\'ll go. Mrs. Jones shall get you anything you like for\r\ndinner,--and,--and--I\'ll stand you a bottle of the \'34 port!"\r\n\r\nBut Captain Bellfield was not going to put up with this. He had\r\nnot sold himself altogether to work Mr. Cheesacre\'s will. "No, old\r\nfellow," said he; "that cock won\'t fight. She has asked me to dine\r\nwith her on Saturday, and I mean to go. I don\'t intend that she shall\r\nthink that I\'m afraid of her,--or of you either."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t;--don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," said the Captain stoutly.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d pay me some of that money you owe me," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"So I will,--when I\'ve married the widow. Ha,--ha,--ha."\r\n\r\nCheesacre longed to turn him out of the house. Words to bid him go,\r\nwere, so to say, upon his tongue. But the man would only have taken\r\nhimself to Norwich, and would have gone without any embargo upon his\r\nsuit; all their treaties would then be at an end. "She knows a trick\r\nworth two of that," said Cheesacre at last.\r\n\r\n"I dare say she does; and if so, why shouldn\'t I go and dine with her\r\nnext Saturday?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you why,--because you\'re in my way. The deuce is in it if\r\nI haven\'t made the whole thing clear enough. I\'ve told you all my\r\nplans because I thought you were my friend, and I\'ve paid you well to\r\nhelp me, too; and yet it seems to me you\'d do anything in your power\r\nto throw me over,--only you can\'t."\r\n\r\n"What an ass you are," said the Captain after a pause; "just you\r\nlisten to me. That scraggy young woman, Charlie Fairstairs, is to be\r\nthere of course."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I do know. She was present when the whole thing\r\nwas arranged, and I heard her asked, and heard her say that she\r\nwould come;--and for the matter of that I heard her declare that she\r\nwouldn\'t set her cap at you, because you\'re a farmer."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word she\'s kind. Upon my word she is," said Cheesacre,\r\ngetting very angry and very red. "Charlie Fairstairs, indeed! I\r\nwouldn\'t pick her out of a gutter with a pair of tongs. She ain\'t\r\ngood enough for my bailiff, let alone me."\r\n\r\n"But somebody must take her in hand on Saturday, if you\'re to do any\r\ngood," said the crafty Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"What the deuce does she have that nasty creature there for?" said\r\nCheesacre, who thought it very hard that everything should not be\r\narranged exactly as he would desire.\r\n\r\n"She wants a companion, of course. You can get rid of Charlie, you\r\nknow, when you make her Mrs. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"Get rid of her! You don\'t suppose she\'ll ever put her foot in this\r\nhouse. Not if I know it. I\'ve detested that woman for the last ten\r\nyears." Cheesacre could forgive no word of slight respecting his\r\nsocial position, and the idea of Miss Fairstairs having pretended to\r\nlook down upon him, galled him to the quick.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to dine with her at any rate," said Bellfield, "and\r\nI always think that four are better company than three on such\r\noccasions."\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre grunted an unwilling assent, and after this it was\r\nlooked upon as an arranged thing that they two should go into Norwich\r\non the Saturday together, and that they should both dine with the\r\nwidow. Indeed, Mrs. Greenow got two notes, one from each of them,\r\naccepting the invitation. Cheesacre wrote in the singular number,\r\naltogether ignoring Captain Bellfield, as he might have ignored his\r\nfootman had he intended to take one. The captain condescended to use\r\nthe plural pronoun. "We shall be so happy to come," said he. "Dear\r\nold Cheesy is out of his little wits with delight," he added, "and\r\nhas already begun to polish off the effects of the farmyard."\r\n\r\n"Effects of the farmyard," said Mrs. Greenow aloud, in Jeannette\'s\r\nhearing, when she received the note. "It would be well for Captain\r\nBellfield if he had a few such effects himself."\r\n\r\n"You can give him enough, ma\'am," said Jeannette, "to make him a\r\nbetter man than Mr. Cheesacre any day. And for a gentleman--of course\r\nI say nothing, but if I was a lady, I know which should be the man\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow\'s Little Dinner in the Close.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow deep and cunning are the wiles of love! When that Saturday\r\nmorning arrived not a word was said by Cheesacre to his rival as\r\nto his plans for the day. "You\'ll take the dog-cart in?" Captain\r\nBellfield had asked overnight. "I don\'t know what I shall do as yet,"\r\nreplied he who was master of the house, of the dog-cart, and, as he\r\nfondly thought, of the situation. But Bellfield knew that Cheesacre\r\nmust take the dog-cart, and was contented. His friend would leave him\r\nbehind, if it were possible, but Bellfield would take care that it\r\nshould not be possible.\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast Mr. Cheesacre surreptitiously carried out into the\r\nyard a bag containing all his apparatus for dressing,--his marrow\r\noil for his hair, his shirt with the wondrous worked front upon an\r\nunder-stratum of pink to give it colour, his shiny boots, and all\r\nthe rest of the paraphernalia. When dining in Norwich on ordinary\r\noccasions, he simply washed his hands there, trusting to the\r\nchambermaid at the inn to find him a comb; and now he came down with\r\nhis bag surreptitiously, and hid it away in the back of the dog-cart\r\nwith secret, but alas, not unobserved hands, hoping that Bellfield\r\nwould forget his toilet. But when did such a Captain ever forget his\r\noutward man? Cheesacre, as he returned through the kitchen from the\r\nyard into the front hall, perceived another bag lying near the door,\r\napparently filled almost as well as his own.\r\n\r\n"What the deuce are you going to do with all this luggage?" said he,\r\ngiving the bag a kick.\r\n\r\n"Put it where I saw you putting yours when I opened my window just\r\nnow," said Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"D---- the window," exclaimed Cheesacre, and then they sat down to\r\nbreakfast. "How you do hack that ham about," he said. "If you ever\r\nfound hams yourself you\'d be more particular in cutting them." This\r\nwas very bad. Even Bellfield could not bear it with equanimity, and\r\nfeeling unable to eat the ham under such circumstances, made his\r\nbreakfast with a couple of fresh eggs. "If you didn\'t mean to eat the\r\nmeat, why the mischief did you cut it?" said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Cheesacre, you\'re too bad;--upon my word you are,"\r\nsaid Bellfield, almost sobbing.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" said the other.\r\n\r\n"Who wants your ham?"\r\n\r\n"You do, I suppose, or you wouldn\'t cut it."\r\n\r\n"No I don\'t; nor anything else either that you\'ve got. It isn\'t fair\r\nto ask a fellow into your house, and then say such things to him as\r\nthat. And it isn\'t what I\'ve been accustomed to either; I can tell\r\nyou that, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well to say bother, but I choose to be treated like a\r\ngentleman wherever I go. You and I have known each other a long time,\r\nand I\'d put up with more from you than from anyone else; but--"\r\n\r\n"Can you pay me the money that you owe me, Bellfield?" said\r\nCheesacre, looking hard at him.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t," said Bellfield; "not immediately."\r\n\r\n"Then eat your breakfast, and hold your tongue."\r\n\r\nAfter that Captain Bellfield did eat his breakfast,--leaving the ham\r\nhowever untouched, and did hold his tongue, vowing vengeance in his\r\nheart. But the two men went into Norwich more amicably together than\r\nthey would have done had there been no words between them. Cheesacre\r\nfelt that he had trespassed a little, and therefore offered the\r\nCaptain a cigar as he seated himself in the cart. Bellfield accepted\r\nthe offering, and smoked the weed of peace.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Cheesacre, as he drove into the Swan yard, "what do you\r\nmean to do with yourself all day?"\r\n\r\n"I shall go down to the quarters, and look the fellows up."\r\n\r\n"All right. But mind this, Bellfield;--it\'s an understood thing, that\r\nyou\'re not to be in the Close before four?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be in the Close before four!"\r\n\r\n"Very well. That\'s understood. If you deceive me, I\'ll not drive you\r\nback to Oileymead to-night."\r\n\r\nIn this instance Captain Bellfield had no intention to deceive.\r\nHe did not think it probable that he could do himself any good\r\nby philandering about the widow early in the day. She would be\r\nengaged with her dinner and with an early toilet. Captain Bellfield,\r\nmoreover, had learned from experience that the first comer has not\r\nalways an advantage in ladies\' society. The mind of a woman is greedy\r\nafter novelty, and it is upon the stranger, or upon the most strange\r\nof her slaves around her, that she often smiles the sweetest. The\r\ncathedral clock, therefore, had struck four before Captain Bellfield\r\nrang Mrs. Greenow\'s bell, and then, when he was shown into the\r\ndrawing-room, he found Cheesacre there alone, redolent with the\r\nmarrow oil, and beautiful with the pink bosom.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you seen her yet?" asked the Captain almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"No," said Cheesacre sulkily.\r\n\r\n"Nor yet Charlie Fairstairs?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen nobody," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment he was compelled to swallow his anger, as Mrs.\r\nGreenow, accompanied by her lady guest, came into the room. "Whoever\r\nwould have expected two gentlemen to be so punctual," said she,\r\n"especially on market-day!"\r\n\r\n"Market-day makes no difference when I come to see you," said\r\nCheesacre, putting his best foot forward, while Captain Bellfield\r\ncontented himself with saying something civil to Charlie. He would\r\nbide his time and ride a waiting race.\r\n\r\nThe widow was almost gorgeous in her weeds. I believe that she\r\nhad not sinned in her dress against any of those canons which the\r\nsemi-ecclesiastical authorities on widowhood have laid down as to the\r\noutward garments fitted for gentlemen\'s relicts. The materials were\r\nthose which are devoted to the deepest conjugal grief. As regarded\r\nevery item of the written law her suttee worship was carried out\r\nto the letter. There was the widow\'s cap, generally so hideous,\r\nso well known to the eyes of all men, so odious to womanhood. Let\r\nus hope that such headgear may have some assuaging effect on the\r\ndeparted spirits of husbands. There was the dress of deep, clinging,\r\nmelancholy crape,--of crape which becomes so brown and so rusty,\r\nand which makes the six months\' widow seem so much more afflicted\r\na creature than she whose husband is just gone, and whose crape is\r\ntherefore new. There were the trailing weepers, and the widow\'s\r\nkerchief pinned close round her neck and somewhat tightly over her\r\nbosom. But there was that of genius about Mrs. Greenow, that she had\r\nturned every seeming disadvantage to some special profit, and had so\r\ndressed herself that though she had obeyed the law to the letter, she\r\nhad thrown the spirit of it to the winds. Her cap sat jauntily on her\r\nhead, and showed just so much of her rich brown hair as to give her\r\nthe appearance of youth which she desired. Cheesacre had blamed her\r\nin his heart for her private carriage, but she spent more money, I\r\nthink, on new crape than she did on her brougham. It never became\r\nbrown and rusty with her, or formed itself into old lumpy folds, or\r\nshaped itself round her like a grave cloth. The written law had not\r\ninterdicted crinoline, and she loomed as large with weeds, which\r\nwith her were not sombre, as she would do with her silks when the\r\nperiod of her probation should be over. Her weepers were bright with\r\nnewness, and she would waft them aside from her shoulder with an air\r\nwhich turned even them into auxiliaries. Her kerchief was fastened\r\nclose round her neck and close over her bosom; but Jeannette well\r\nknew what she was doing as she fastened it,--and so did Jeannette\'s\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow would still talk much about her husband, declaring that\r\nher loss was as fresh to her wounded heart, as though he, on whom\r\nall her happiness had rested, had left her only yesterday; but\r\nyet she mistook her dates, frequently referring to the melancholy\r\ncircumstance, as having taken place fifteen months ago. In truth,\r\nhowever, Mr. Greenow had been alive within the last nine months,--as\r\neverybody around her knew. But if she chose to forget the exact day,\r\nwhy should her friends or dependents remind her of it? No friend or\r\ndependent did remind her of it, and Charlie Fairstairs spoke of the\r\nfifteen months with bold confidence,--false-tongued little parasite\r\nthat she was.\r\n\r\n"Looking well," said the widow, in answer to some outspoken\r\ncompliment from Mr. Cheesacre. "Yes, I\'m well enough in health, and\r\nI suppose I ought to be thankful that it is so. But if you had buried\r\na wife whom you had loved within the last eighteen months, you would\r\nhave become as indifferent as I am to all that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"I never was married yet," said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"And therefore you know nothing about it. Everything in the world\r\nis gay and fresh to you. If I were you, Mr. Cheesacre, I would not\r\nrun the risk. It is hardly worth a woman\'s while, and I suppose not\r\na man\'s. The sufferings are too great!" Whereupon she pressed her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"But I mean to try all the same," said Cheesacre, looking the lover\r\nall over as he gazed into the fair one\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I hope that you may be successful, Mr. Cheesacre, and that she may\r\nnot be torn away from you early in life. Is dinner ready, Jeannette?\r\nThat\'s well. Mr. Cheesacre, will you give your arm to Miss\r\nFairstairs?"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to Mrs. Greenow\'s correctness. As Captain\r\nBellfield held, or had held, her Majesty\'s commission, he was clearly\r\nentitled to take the mistress of the festival down to dinner. But\r\nCheesacre would not look at it in this light. He would only remember\r\nthat he had paid for the Captain\'s food for some time past, that the\r\nCaptain had been brought into Norwich in his gig, that the Captain\r\nowed him money, and ought, so to say, to be regarded as his property\r\non the occasion. "I pay my way, and that ought to give a man higher\r\nstation than being a beggarly captain,--which I don\'t believe he is,\r\nif all the truth was known." It was thus that he took an occasion to\r\nexpress himself to Miss Fairstairs on that very evening. "Military\r\nrank is always recognised," Miss Fairstairs had replied, taking Mr.\r\nCheesacre\'s remarks as a direct slight upon herself. He had taken her\r\ndown to dinner, and had then come to her complaining that he had been\r\ninjured in being called upon to do so! "If you were a magistrate, Mr.\r\nCheesacre, you would have rank; but I believe you are not." Charlie\r\nFairstairs knew well what she was about. Mr. Cheesacre had striven\r\nmuch to get his name put upon the commission of the peace, but had\r\nfailed. "Nasty, scraggy old cat," Cheesacre said to himself, as he\r\nturned away from her.\r\n\r\nBut Bellfield gained little by taking the widow down. He and\r\nCheesacre were placed at the top and bottom of the table, so that\r\nthey might do the work of carving; and the ladies sat at the sides.\r\nMrs. Greenow\'s hospitality was very good. The dinner was exactly\r\nwhat a dinner ought to be for four persons. There was soup, fish,\r\na cutlet, a roast fowl, and some game. Jeannette waited at table\r\nnimbly, and the thing could not have been done better. Mrs. Greenow\'s\r\nappetite was not injured by her grief, and she so far repressed for\r\nthe time all remembrance of her sorrow as to enable her to play the\r\nkind hostess to perfection. Under her immediate eye Cheesacre was\r\nforced into apparent cordiality with his friend Bellfield, and the\r\nCaptain himself took the good things which the gods provided with\r\nthankful good-humour.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was done at the dinner-table. No work got itself\r\naccomplished. The widow was so accurately fair in the adjustment of\r\nher favours, that even Jeannette could not perceive to which of the\r\ntwo she turned with the amplest smile. She talked herself and made\r\nothers talk, till Cheesacre became almost comfortable, in spite of\r\nhis jealousy. "And now," she said, as she got up to leave the room,\r\nwhen she had taken her own glass of wine, "We will allow these two\r\ngentlemen just half an hour, eh Charlie? and then we shall expect\r\nthem up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes will be enough for us here," said Cheesacre, who was in\r\na hurry to utilize his time.\r\n\r\n"Half an hour," said Mrs. Greenow, not without some little tone of\r\ncommand in her voice. Ten minutes might be enough for Mr. Cheesacre,\r\nbut ten minutes was not enough for her.\r\n\r\nBellfield had opened the door, and it was upon him that the widow\'s\r\neye glanced as she left the room. Cheesacre saw it, and resolved to\r\nresent the injury. "I\'ll tell you what it is, Bellfield," he said, as\r\nhe sat down moodily over the fire, "I won\'t have you coming here at\r\nall, till this matter is settled."\r\n\r\n"Till what matter is settled?" said Bellfield, filling his glass.\r\n\r\n"You know what matter I mean."\r\n\r\n"You take such a deuce of a time about it."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. I take as little time as anybody could. That other\r\nfellow has only been dead about nine months, and I\'ve got the thing\r\nin excellent training already."\r\n\r\n"And what harm do I do?"\r\n\r\n"You disturb me, and you disturb her. You do it on purpose. Do you\r\nsuppose I can\'t see? I\'ll tell you what, now; if you\'ll go clean out\r\nof Norwich for a month, I\'ll lend you two hundred pounds on the day\r\nshe becomes Mrs. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"And where am I to go to?"\r\n\r\n"You may stay at Oileymead, if you like;--that is, on condition that\r\nyou do stay there."\r\n\r\n"And be told that I hack the ham because it\'s not my own. Shall I\r\ntell you a piece of my mind, Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"That woman has no more idea of marrying you than she has of marrying\r\nthe Bishop. Won\'t you fill your glass, old fellow? I know where the\r\ntap is if you want another bottle. You may as well give it up, and\r\nspend no more money in pink fronts and polished boots on her account.\r\nYou\'re a podgy man, you see, and Mrs. Greenow doesn\'t like podgy men."\r\n\r\nCheesacre sat looking at him with his mouth open, dumb with surprise,\r\nand almost paralysed with impotent anger. What had happened during\r\nthe last few hours to change so entirely the tone of his dependent\r\ncaptain? Could it be that Bellfield had been there during the\r\nmorning, and that she had accepted him?\r\n\r\n"You are very podgy, Cheesacre," Bellfield continued, "and then you\r\nso often smell of the farm-yard; and you talk too much of your money\r\nand your property. You\'d have had a better chance if you had openly\r\ntalked to her of hers,--as I have done. As it is, you haven\'t any\r\nchance at all."\r\n\r\nBellfield, as he thus spoke to the man opposite to him, went on\r\ndrinking his wine comfortably, and seemed to be chuckling with glee.\r\nCheesacre was so astounded, so lost in amazement that the creature\r\nwhom he had fed,--whom he had bribed with money out of his own\r\npocket, should thus turn against him, that for a while he could not\r\ncollect his thoughts or find voice wherewith to make any answer. It\r\noccurred to him immediately that Bellfield was even now, at this very\r\ntime, staying at his house,--that he, Cheesacre, was expected to\r\ndrive him, Bellfield, back to Oileymead, to his own Oileymead, on\r\nthis very evening; and as he thought of this he almost fancied that\r\nhe must be in a dream. He shook himself, and looked again, and there\r\nsat Bellfield, eyeing him through the bright colour of a glass of\r\nport.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ve told you a bit of my mind, Cheesy, my boy," continued\r\nBellfield, "and you\'ll save yourself a deal of trouble and annoyance\r\nif you\'ll believe what I say. She doesn\'t mean to marry you. It\'s\r\nmost probable that she\'ll marry me; but, at any rate, she won\'t marry\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to pay me my money, sir?" said Cheesacre, at last,\r\nfinding his readiest means of attack in that quarter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do."\r\n\r\n"But when?"\r\n\r\n"When I\'ve married Mrs. Greenow,--and, therefore, I expect your\r\nassistance in that little scheme. Let us drink her health. We shall\r\nalways be delighted to see you at our house, Cheesy, my boy, and you\r\nshall be allowed to hack the hams just as much as you please."\r\n\r\n"You shall be made to pay for this," said Cheesacre, gasping with\r\nanger;--gasping almost more with dismay than he did with anger.\r\n\r\n"All right, old fellow; I\'ll pay for it,--with the widow\'s money.\r\nCome; our half-hour is nearly over; shall we go up-stairs?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll expose you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t now;--don\'t be ill-natured."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me where you mean to sleep to-night, Captain\r\nBellfield?"\r\n\r\n"If I sleep at Oileymead it will only be on condition that I have one\r\nof the mahogany-furnitured bedrooms."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never put your foot in that house again. You\'re a rascal,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Cheesy, it won\'t do for us to quarrel in a lady\'s house.\r\nIt wouldn\'t be the thing at all. You\'re not drinking your wine. You\r\nmight as well take another glass, and then we\'ll go up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve left your traps at Oileymead, and not one of them you shall\r\nhave till you\'ve paid me every shilling you owe me. I don\'t believe\r\nyou\'ve a shirt in the world beyond what you\'ve got there."\r\n\r\n"It\'s lucky I brought one in to change; wasn\'t it, Cheesy? I\r\nshouldn\'t have thought of it only for the hint you gave me. I might\r\nas well ring the bell for Jeannette to put away the wine, if you\r\nwon\'t take any more." Then he rang the bell, and when Jeannette came\r\nhe skipped lightly up-stairs into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Was he here before to-day?" said Cheesacre, nodding his head at the\r\ndoorway through which Bellfield had passed.\r\n\r\n"Who? The Captain? Oh dear no. The Captain don\'t come here much\r\nnow;--not to say often, by no means."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a confounded rascal."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre!" said Jeannette.\r\n\r\n"He is;--and I ain\'t sure that there ain\'t others nearly as bad as he\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"If you mean me, Mr. Cheesacre, I do declare you\'re a wronging me; I\r\ndo indeed."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the meaning of his going on in this way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know nothing of his ways, Mr. Cheesacre; but I\'ve been as\r\ntrue to you, sir;--so I have;--as true as true." And Jeannette put\r\nher handkerchief up to her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe moved to the door, and then a thought occurred to him. He put his\r\nhand to his trousers pocket, and turning back towards the girl, gave\r\nher half-a-crown. She curtsied as she took it, and then repeated her\r\nlast words. "Yes, Mr. Cheesacre,--as true as true." Mr. Cheesacre said\r\nnothing further, but followed his enemy up to the drawing-room. "What\r\ngame is up now, I wonder," said Jeannette to herself, when she was\r\nleft alone. "They two\'ll be cutting each other\'s throatses before\r\nthey\'ve done, and then my missus will take the surwiver." But she\r\nmade up her mind that Cheesacre should be the one to have his throat\r\ncut fatally, and that Bellfield should be the survivor.\r\n\r\nCheesacre, when he reached the drawing-room, found Bellfield sitting\r\non the same sofa with Mrs. Greenow looking at a book of photographs\r\nwhich they both of them were handling together. The outside rim of\r\nher widow\'s frill on one occasion touched the Captain\'s whisker, and\r\nas it did so the Captain looked up with a gratified expression of\r\ntriumph. If any gentleman has ever seen the same thing under similar\r\ncircumstances, he will understand that Cheesacre must have been\r\nannoyed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Greenow, waving her handkerchief, of which little but\r\na two-inch-deep border seemed to be visible. Bellfield knew at once\r\nthat it was not the same handkerchief which she had waved before they\r\nwent down to dinner. "Yes,--there he is. It\'s so like him." And then\r\nshe apostrophized the _carte de visite_ of the departed one. "Dear\r\nGreenow; dear husband! When my spirit is false to thee, let thine\r\nforget to visit me softly in my dreams. Thou wast unmatched among\r\nhusbands. Whose tender kindness was ever equal to thine? whose sweet\r\ntemper was ever so constant? whose manly care so all-sufficient?"\r\nWhile the words fell from her lips her little finger was touching\r\nBellfield\'s little finger, as they held the book between them.\r\nCharlie Fairstairs and Mr. Cheesacre were watching her narrowly, and\r\nshe knew that they were watching her. She was certainly a woman of\r\ngreat genius and of great courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Dear Greenow; dear husband!"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBellfield, moved by the eloquence of her words, looked with some\r\ninterest at the photograph. There was represented there before him,\r\na small, grey-looking, insignificant old man, with pig\'s eyes and a\r\ntoothless mouth,--one who should never have been compelled to submit\r\nhimself to the cruelty of the sun\'s portraiture! Another widow, even\r\nif she had kept in her book the photograph of such a husband, would\r\nhave scrambled it over silently,--would have been ashamed to show it.\r\n"Have you ever seen it, Mr. Cheesacre?" asked Mrs. Greenow. "It\'s so\r\nlike him."\r\n\r\n"I saw it at Yarmouth," said Cheesacre, very sulkily.\r\n\r\n"That you did not," said the lady with some dignity, and not a little\r\nof rebuke in her tone; "simply because it never was at Yarmouth. A\r\nlarger one you may have seen, which I always keep, and always shall\r\nkeep, close by my bedside."\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it," said Captain Bellfield to himself. Then the widow\r\npunished Mr. Cheesacre for his sullenness by whispering a few words to\r\nthe Captain; and Cheesacre in his wrath turned to Charlie Fairstairs.\r\nThen it was that he spake out his mind about the Captain\'s rank, and\r\nwas snubbed by Charlie,--as was told a page or two back.\r\n\r\nAfter that, coffee was brought to them, and here again Cheesacre in\r\nhis ill-humour allowed the Captain to out-manoeuvre him. It was the\r\nCaptain who put the sugar into the cups and handed them round. He\r\neven handed a cup to his enemy. "None for me, Captain Bellfield; many\r\nthanks for your politeness all the same," said Mr. Cheesacre; and\r\nMrs. Greenow knew from the tone of his voice that there had been a\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\nCheesacre sitting then in his gloom, had resolved upon one\r\nthing,--or, I may perhaps say, upon two things. He had resolved that\r\nhe would not leave the room that evening till Bellfield had left it;\r\nand that he would get a final answer from the widow, if not that\r\nnight,--for he thought it very possible that they might both be sent\r\naway together,--then early after breakfast on the following morning.\r\nFor the present, he had given up any idea of turning his time to\r\ngood account. He was not perhaps a coward, but he had not that\r\nspecial courage which enables a man to fight well under adverse\r\ncircumstances. He had been cowed by the unexpected impertinence of\r\nhis rival,--by the insolence of a man to whom he thought that he had\r\nobtained the power of being always himself as insolent as he pleased.\r\nHe could not recover his ground quickly, or carry himself before his\r\nlady\'s eye as though he was unconscious of the wound he had received.\r\nSo he sat silent, while Bellfield was discoursing fluently. He sat\r\nin silence, comforting himself with reflections on his own wealth,\r\nand on the poverty of the other, and promising himself a rich harvest\r\nof revenge when the moment should come in which he might tell Mrs.\r\nGreenow how absolutely that man was a beggar, a swindler, and a\r\nrascal.\r\n\r\nAnd he was astonished when an opportunity for doing so came very\r\nquickly. Before the neighbouring clock had done striking seven,\r\nBellfield rose from his chair to go. He first of all spoke a word of\r\nfarewell to Miss Fairstairs; then he turned to his late host; "Good\r\nnight, Cheesacre," he said, in the easiest tone in the world; after\r\nthat he pressed the widow\'s hand and whispered his adieu.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were staying at Oileymead?" said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"I came from there this morning," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"But he isn\'t going back there, I can tell you," said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Greenow; "I hope there is nothing wrong."\r\n\r\n"All as right as a trivet," said the Captain; and then he was off.\r\n\r\n"I promised mamma that I would be home by seven," said Charlie\r\nFairstairs, rising from her chair. It cannot be supposed that she had\r\nany wish to oblige Mr. Cheesacre, and therefore this movement on her\r\npart must be regarded simply as done in kindness to Mrs. Greenow. She\r\nmight be mistaken in supposing that Mrs. Greenow would desire to be\r\nleft alone with Mr. Cheesacre; but it was clear to her that in this\r\nway she could give no offence, whereas it was quite possible that she\r\nmight offend by remaining. A little after seven Mr. Cheesacre found\r\nhimself alone with the lady.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to find," said she, gravely, "that you two have\r\nquarrelled."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow," said he, jumping up, and becoming on a sudden full of\r\nlife, "that man is a downright swindler."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"He is. He\'ll tell you that he was at Inkerman, but I believe he\r\nwas in prison all the time." The Captain had been arrested, I think\r\ntwice, and thus Mr. Cheesacre justified to himself this assertion. "I\r\ndoubt whether he ever saw a shot fired," he continued.\r\n\r\n"He\'s none the worse for that."\r\n\r\n"But he tells such lies; and then he has not a penny in the world.\r\nHow much do you suppose he owes me, now?"\r\n\r\n"However much it is, I\'m sure you are too much of a gentleman to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes, I am," said he, trying to recover himself. "But when I\r\nasked him how he intended to pay me, what do you think he said? He\r\nsaid he\'d pay me when he got your money."\r\n\r\n"My money! He couldn\'t have said that!"\r\n\r\n"But he did, Mrs. Greenow; I give you my word and honour. \'I\'ll pay\r\nyou when I get the widow\'s money,\' he said."\r\n\r\n"You gentlemen must have a nice way of talking about me when I am\r\nabsent."\r\n\r\n"I never said a disrespectful word about you in my life, Mrs.\r\nGreenow,--or thought one. He does;--he says horrible things."\r\n\r\n"What horrible things, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t tell you;--but he does. What can you expect from such\r\na man as that, who, to my knowledge, won\'t have a change of clothes\r\nto-morrow, except what he brought in on his back this morning. Where\r\nhe\'s to get a bed to-night, I don\'t know, for I doubt whether he\'s\r\ngot half-a-crown in the world."\r\n\r\n"Poor Bellfield!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is poor."\r\n\r\n"But how gracefully he carries his poverty."\r\n\r\n"I should call it very disgraceful, Mrs. Greenow." To this she made\r\nno reply, and then he thought that he might begin his work. "Mrs.\r\nGreenow,--may I say Arabella?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre!"\r\n\r\n"But mayn\'t I? Come, Mrs. Greenow. You know well enough by this time\r\nwhat it is I mean. What\'s the use of shilly-shallying?"\r\n\r\n"Shilly-shallying, Mr. Cheesacre! I never heard such language. If I\r\nbid you good night, now, and tell you that it is time for you to go\r\nhome, shall you call that shilly-shallying?"\r\n\r\nHe had made a mistake in his word and repented it. "I beg your\r\npardon, Mrs. Greenow; I do indeed. I didn\'t mean anything offensive."\r\n\r\n"Shilly-shallying, indeed! There\'s very little shall in it, I can\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\nThe poor man was dreadfully crestfallen, so much so that the widow\'s\r\nheart relented, and she pardoned him. It was not in her nature to\r\nquarrel with people;--at any rate, not with her lovers. "I beg your\r\npardon, Mrs. Greenow," said the culprit, humbly. "It is granted," said\r\nthe widow; "but never tell a lady again that she is shilly-shallying.\r\nAnd look here, Mr. Cheesacre, if it should ever come to pass that you\r\nare making love to a lady in earnest--"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t be more in earnest," said he.\r\n\r\n"That you are making love to a lady in earnest, talk to her a little\r\nmore about your passion and a little less about your purse. Now, good\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"But we are friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--as good friends as ever."\r\n\r\nCheesacre, as he drove himself home in the dark, tried to console\r\nhimself by thinking of the miserable plight in which Bellfield would\r\nfind himself at Norwich, with no possessions but what he had brought\r\ninto the town that day in a small bag. But as he turned in at his\r\nown gate he met two figures emerging; one of them was laden with a\r\nportmanteau, and the other with a hat case.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only me, Cheesy, my boy," said Bellfield. "I\'ve just come down\r\nby the rail to fetch my things, and I\'m going back to Norwich by the\r\n9.20.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve stolen anything of mine I\'ll have you prosecuted," roared\r\nCheesacre, as he drove his gig up to his own door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nA Noble Lord Dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor remained about four days beneath his grandfather\'s\r\nroof; but he was not happy there himself, nor did he contribute to\r\nthe happiness of any one else. He remained there in great discomfort\r\nso long, being unwilling to leave till an answer had been received to\r\nthe request made to Aunt Greenow, in order that he might insist on\r\nKate\'s performance of her promise with reference to Alice, if that\r\nanswer should be unfavourable. During these five days Kate did all\r\nin her power to induce her brother to be, at any rate, kind in his\r\nmanner towards his grandfather, but it was in vain. The Squire would\r\nnot be the first to be gracious; and George, quite as obstinate as\r\nthe old man, would take no steps in that direction till encouraged\r\nto do so by graciousness from the other side. Poor Kate entreated\r\neach of them to begin, but her entreaties were of no avail. "He is\r\nan ill-mannered cub," the old man said, "and I was a fool to let him\r\ninto the house. Don\'t mention his name to me again." George argued\r\nthe matter more at length. Kate spoke to him of his own interest in\r\nthe matter, urging upon him that he might, by such conduct, drive the\r\nSquire to exclude him altogether from the property.\r\n\r\n"He must do as he likes," George said, sulkily.\r\n\r\n"But for Alice\'s sake!" Kate answered.\r\n\r\n"Alice would be the last to expect me to submit to unreasonable\r\nill-usage for the sake of money. As regards myself, I confess that\r\nI\'m very fond of money and am not particularly squeamish. I would\r\ndo anything that a man can do to secure it. But this I can\'t do. I\r\nnever injured him, and I never asked him to injure himself. I never\r\nattempted to borrow money from him. I have never cost him a shilling.\r\nWhen I was in the wine business he might have enabled me to make a\r\nlarge fortune simply by settling on me then the reversion of property\r\nwhich, when he dies, ought to be my own. He was so perversely\r\nignorant that he would make no inquiry, but chose to think that I was\r\nruining myself, at the only time of my life when I was really doing\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"But he had a right to act as he pleased," urged Kate.\r\n\r\n"Certainly he had. But he had no right to resent my asking such a\r\nfavour at his hands. He was an ignorant old fool not to do it; but\r\nI should never have quarrelled with him on that account. Nature made\r\nhim a fool, and it wasn\'t his fault. But I can\'t bring myself to\r\nkneel in the dirt before him simply because I asked for what was\r\nreasonable."\r\n\r\nThe two men said very little to each other. They were never alone\r\ntogether except during that half-hour after dinner in which they\r\nwere supposed to drink their wine. The old Squire always took three\r\nglasses of port during this period, and expected that his grandson\r\nwould take three with him. But George would drink none at all.\r\n"I have given up drinking wine after dinner," said he, when his\r\ngrandfather pushed the bottle over to him. "I suppose you mean that\r\nyou drink nothing but claret," said the Squire, in a tone of voice\r\nthat was certainly not conciliatory. "I mean simply what I say," said\r\nGeorge--"that I have given up drinking wine after dinner." The old\r\nman could not openly quarrel with his heir on such a point as that.\r\nEven Mr. Vavasor could not tell his grandson that he was going to the\r\ndogs because he had become temperate. But, nevertheless, there was\r\noffence in it; and when George sat perfectly silent, looking at the\r\nfire, evidently determined to make no attempt at conversation, the\r\noffence grew, and became strong. "What the devil\'s the use of your\r\nsitting there if you neither drink nor talk?" said the old man. "No\r\nuse in the world, that I can see," said George; "if, however, I were\r\nto leave you, you would abuse me for it." "I don\'t care how soon you\r\nleave me," said the Squire. From all which it may be seen that George\r\nVavasor\'s visit to the hall of his ancestors was not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, about noon, came Aunt Greenow\'s reply. "Dearest\r\nKate," she said, "I am not going to do what you ask me,"--thus\r\nrushing instantly into the middle of her subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n   You see, I don\'t know my nephew, and have no reason for\r\n   being specially anxious that he should be in Parliament.\r\n   I don\'t care two straws about the glory of the Vavasor\r\n   family. If I had never done anything for myself, the\r\n   Vavasors would have done very little for me. I don\'t care\r\n   much about what you call \'blood.\' I like those who like\r\n   me, and whom I know. I am very fond of you, and because\r\n   you have been good to me I would give you a thousand\r\n   pounds if you wanted it for yourself; but I don\'t see why\r\n   I am to give my money to those I don\'t know. If it is\r\n   necessary to tell my nephew of this, pray tell him that I\r\n   mean no offence.\r\n\r\n   Your friend C. is still waiting--waiting--waiting,\r\n   patiently; but his patience may be exhausted.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate aunt,\r\n\r\n   ARABELLA GREENOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Of course she won\'t," said George, as he threw back the letter to\r\nhis sister. "Why should she?"\r\n\r\n"I had hoped she would," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Why should she? What did I ever do for her? She is a sensible woman.\r\nWho is your friend C., and why is he waiting patiently?"\r\n\r\n"He is a man who would be glad to marry her for her money, if she\r\nwould take him."\r\n\r\n"Then what does she mean by his patience being exhausted?"\r\n\r\n"It is her folly. She chooses to pretend to think that the man is a\r\nlover of mine."\r\n\r\n"Has he got any money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; lots of money--or money\'s worth."\r\n\r\n"And what is his name?"\r\n\r\n"His name is Cheesacre. But pray don\'t trouble yourself to talk about\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"If he wants to marry you, and has plenty of money, why shouldn\'t you\r\ntake him?"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, George! In the first place he does not want to marry\r\nme. In the next place all his heart is in his farmyard."\r\n\r\n"And a very good place to have it," said George.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly. But, really, you must not trouble yourself to talk\r\nabout him."\r\n\r\n"Only this,--that I should be very glad to see you well married."\r\n\r\n"Should you?" said she, thinking of her close attachment to himself.\r\n\r\n"And now, about the money," said George. "You must write to Alice at\r\nonce."--"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"Of course you must; you have promised. Indeed, it would have been\r\nmuch wiser if you had taken me at my word, and done it at once."--"I\r\ncannot do it."\r\n\r\nThen the scar on his face opened itself, and his sister stood before\r\nhim in fear and trembling. "Do you mean to tell me," said he, "that\r\nyou will go back from your word, and deceive me;--that after having\r\nkept me here by this promise, you will not do what you have said you\r\nwould do?"\r\n\r\n"Take my money now, and pay me out of hers as soon as you are\r\nmarried. I will be the first to claim it from her,--and from you."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Why should it be nonsense? Surely you need have no scruple with me.\r\nI should have none with you if I wanted assistance."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Kate; I won\'t have it, and there\'s an end of it. All that\r\nyou have in the world would not pull me through this election, and\r\ntherefore such a loan would be worse than useless."\r\n\r\n"And am I to ask her for more than two thousand pounds?"\r\n\r\n"You are to ask her simply for one thousand. That is what I want, and\r\nmust have, at present. And she knows that I want it, and that she is\r\nto supply it; only she does not know that my need is so immediate.\r\nThat you must explain to her."\r\n\r\n"I would sooner burn my hand, George!"\r\n\r\n"But burning your hand, unfortunately, won\'t do any good. Look here,\r\nKate; I insist upon your doing this for me. If you do not, I shall\r\ndo it, of course, myself; but I shall regard your refusal as an\r\nunjustifiable falsehood on your part, and shall certainly not see you\r\nafterwards. I do not wish, for reasons which you may well understand,\r\nto write to Alice myself on any subject at present. I now claim your\r\npromise to do so; and if you refuse, I shall know very well what to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nOf course she did not persist in her refusal. With a sorrowful heart,\r\nand with fingers that could hardly form the needful letters, she did\r\nwrite a letter to her cousin, which explained the fact--that George\r\nVavasor immediately wanted a thousand pounds for his electioneering\r\npurposes. It was a stiff, uncomfortable letter, unnatural in\r\nits phraseology, telling its own tale of grief and shame. Alice\r\nunderstood very plainly all the circumstances under which it was\r\nwritten, but she sent back word to Kate at once, undertaking that the\r\nmoney should be forthcoming; and she wrote again before the end of\r\nJanuary, saying that the sum named had been paid to George\'s credit\r\nat his own bankers.\r\n\r\nKate had taken immense pride in the renewal of the match between her\r\nbrother and her cousin, and had rejoiced in it greatly as being her\r\nown work. But all that pride and joy were now over. She could no\r\nlonger write triumphant notes to Alice, speaking always of George as\r\none who was to be their joint hero, foretelling great things of his\r\ncareer in Parliament, and saying little soft things of his enduring\r\nlove. It was no longer possible to her now to write of George at all,\r\nand it was equally impossible to Alice. Indeed, no letters passed\r\nbetween them, when that monetary correspondence was over, up to the\r\nend of the winter. Kate remained down in Westmoreland, wretched\r\nand ill at ease, listening to hard words spoken by her grandfather\r\nagainst her brother, and feeling herself unable to take her brother\'s\r\npart as she had been wont to do in other times.\r\n\r\nGeorge returned to town at the end of those four days, and found that\r\nthe thousand pounds was duly placed to his credit before the end of\r\nthe month. It is hardly necessary to tell the reader that this money\r\nhad come from the stores of Mr. Tombe, and that Mr. Tombe duly debited\r\nMr. Grey with the amount. Alice, in accordance with her promise,\r\nhad told her father that the money was needed, and her father, in\r\naccordance with his promise, had procured it without a word of\r\nremonstrance. "Surely I must sign some paper," Alice had said. But\r\nshe had been contented when her father told her that the lawyers\r\nwould manage all that.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly the end of February when George Vavasor made his first\r\npayment to Mr. Scruby on behalf of the coming election; and when he\r\ncalled at Mr. Scruby\'s office with this object, he received some\r\nintelligence which surprised him not a little. "You haven\'t heard the\r\nnews," said Scruby. "What news?" said George.\r\n\r\n"The Marquis is as nearly off the hooks as a man can be." Mr. Scruby,\r\nas he communicated the tidings, showed clearly by his face and voice\r\nthat they were supposed to be of very great importance; but Vavasor\r\ndid not at first seem to be as much interested in the fate of "the\r\nMarquis" as Scruby had intended.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry for him," said George. "Who is the Marquis? There\'ll\r\nbe sure to come another, so it don\'t much signify."\r\n\r\n"There will come another, and that\'s just it. It\'s the Marquis of\r\nBunratty; and if he drops, our young Member will go into the Upper\r\nHouse."\r\n\r\n"What, immediately; before the end of the Session?" George, of\r\ncourse, knew well enough that such would be the case, but the effect\r\nwhich this event would have upon himself now struck him suddenly.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said Scruby. "The writ would be out immediately. I\r\nshould be glad enough of it, only that I know that Travers\'s people\r\nhave heard of it before us, and that they are ready to be up with\r\ntheir posters directly the breath is out of the Marquis\'s body. We\r\nmust go to work immediately; that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"It will only be for part of a Session," said George.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mr. Scruby.\r\n\r\n"And then there\'ll be the cost of another election."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said Mr. Scruby; "but in such cases we do manage to\r\nmake it come a little cheaper. If you lick Travers now, it may be\r\nthat you\'ll have a walk-over for the next."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Grimes?" asked George.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have; the blackguard! He is going to open his house on\r\nTravers\'s side. He came to me as bold as brass, and told me so,\r\nsaying that he never liked gentlemen who kept him waiting for his\r\nodd money. What angers me is that he ever got it."\r\n\r\n"We have not managed it very well, certainly," said Vavasor, looking\r\nnastily at the attorney.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t help those little accidents, Mr. Vavasor. There are worse\r\naccidents than that turn up almost daily in my business. You may\r\nthink yourself almost lucky that I haven\'t gone over to Travers\r\nmyself. He is a Liberal, you know; and it hasn\'t been for want of an\r\noffer, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nVavasor was inclined to doubt the extent of his luck in this respect,\r\nand was almost disposed to repent of his Parliamentary ambition.\r\nHe would now be called upon to spend certainly not less than three\r\nthousand pounds of his cousin\'s money on the chance of being able to\r\nsit in Parliament for a few months. And then, after what a fashion\r\nwould he be compelled to negotiate that loan! He might, to be sure,\r\nallow the remainder of this Session to run, and stand, as he had\r\nintended, at the general election; but he knew that if he now allowed\r\na Liberal to win the seat, the holder of the seat would be almost\r\nsure of subsequent success. He must either fight now, or give up the\r\nfight altogether; and he was a man who did not love to abandon any\r\ncontest in which he had been engaged.\r\n\r\n"Well, Squire," said Scruby, "how is it to be?" And Vavasor felt\r\nthat he detected in the man\'s voice some diminution of that respect\r\nwith which he had hitherto been treated as a paying candidate for a\r\nmetropolitan borough.\r\n\r\n"This lord is not dead yet," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"No; he\'s not dead yet, that we have heard; but it won\'t do for us to\r\nwait. We want every minute of time that we can get. There isn\'t any\r\nhope for him, I\'m told. It\'s gout in the stomach, or dropsy at the\r\nheart, or some of those things that make a fellow safe to go."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do to wait for the next election?"\r\n\r\n"If you ask me, I should say certainly not. Indeed, I shouldn\'t wish\r\nto have to conduct it under such circumstances. I hate a fight when\r\nthere\'s no chance of success. I grudge spending a man\'s money in such\r\na case; I do indeed, Mr. Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Grimes\'s going over won\'t make much difference?"\r\n\r\n"The blackguard! He\'ll take a hundred and fifty votes, I suppose;\r\nperhaps more. But that is not much in such a constituency as the\r\nChelsea districts. You see, Travers played mean at the last election,\r\nand that will be against him."\r\n\r\n"But the Conservatives will have a candidate."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing; but I don\'t think they will. They\'ll try one\r\nat the general, no doubt; but if the two sitting Members can pull\r\ntogether, they won\'t have much of a chance."\r\n\r\nVavasor found himself compelled to say that he would stand; and\r\nScruby undertook to give the initiatory orders at once, not waiting\r\neven till the Marquis should be dead. "We should have our houses open\r\nas soon as theirs," said he. "There\'s a deal in that." So George\r\nVavasor gave his orders. "If the worst comes to the worst," he said\r\nto himself, "I can always cut my throat."\r\n\r\nAs he walked from the attorney\'s office to his club he bethought\r\nhimself that that might not unprobably be the necessary termination\r\nof his career. Everything was going wrong with him. His grandfather,\r\nwho was eighty years of age, would not die,--appeared to have no\r\nsymptoms of dying;--whereas this Marquis, who was not yet much over\r\nfifty, was rushing headlong out of the world, simply because he was\r\nthe one man whose continued life at the present moment would be\r\nserviceable to George Vavasor. As he thought of his grandfather he\r\nalmost broke his umbrella by the vehemence with which he struck it\r\nagainst the pavement. What right could an ignorant old fool like that\r\nhave to live for ever, keeping the possession of a property which\r\nhe could not use, and ruining those who were to come after him? If\r\nnow, at this moment, that wretched place down in Westmoreland could\r\nbecome his, he might yet ride triumphantly over his difficulties, and\r\nrefrain from sullying his hands with more of his cousin\'s money till\r\nshe should become his wife.\r\n\r\nEven that thousand pounds had not passed through his hands without\r\ngiving him much bitter suffering. As is always the case in such\r\nmatters, the thing done was worse than the doing of it. He had taught\r\nhimself to look at it lightly whilst it was yet unaccomplished; but\r\nhe could not think of it lightly now. Kate had been right. It would\r\nhave been better for him to take her money. Any money would have been\r\nbetter than that upon which he had laid his sacrilegious hands. If\r\nhe could have cut a purse, after the old fashion, the stain of the\r\ndeed would hardly have been so deep. In these days,--for more than\r\na month, indeed, after his return from Westmoreland,--he did not go\r\nnear Queen Anne Street, trying to persuade himself that he stayed\r\naway because of her coldness to him. But, in truth, he was afraid of\r\nseeing her without speaking of her money, and afraid to see her if he\r\nwere to speak of it.\r\n\r\n"You have seen the _Globe_?" someone said to him as he entered the\r\nclub.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; I have seen nothing."\r\n\r\n"Bunratty died in Ireland this morning. I suppose you\'ll be up for\r\nthe Chelsea districts?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nParliament Meets.\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament opened that year on the twelfth of February, and Mr.\r\nPalliser was one of the first Members of the Lower House to take his\r\nseat. It had been generally asserted through the country, during the\r\nlast week, that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had, so to\r\nsay, ceased to exist as such; that though he still existed to the\r\nouter world, drawing his salary, and doing routine work,--if a man\r\nso big can have any routine work to do,--he existed no longer in\r\nthe inner world of the cabinet. He had differed, men said, with\r\nhis friend and chief, the Prime Minister, as to the expediency of\r\nrepealing what were left of the direct taxes of the country, and was\r\nprepared to launch himself into opposition with his small bodyguard\r\nof followers, with all his energy and with all his venom.\r\n\r\nThere is something very pleasant in the close, bosom friendship, and\r\nbitter, uncompromising animosity, of these human gods,--of these\r\nhuman beings who would be gods were they not shorn so short of their\r\ndivinity in that matter of immortality. If it were so arranged that\r\nthe same persons were always friends, and the same persons were\r\nalways enemies, as used to be the case among the dear old heathen\r\ngods and goddesses;--if Parliament were an Olympus in which Juno and\r\nVenus never kissed, the thing would not be nearly so interesting. But\r\nin this Olympus partners are changed, the divine bosom, now rabid\r\nwith hatred against some opposing deity, suddenly becomes replete\r\nwith love towards its late enemy, and exciting changes occur which\r\ngive to the whole thing all the keen interest of a sensational novel.\r\nNo doubt this is greatly lessened for those who come too near the\r\nscene of action. Members of Parliament, and the friends of Members\r\nof Parliament, are apt to teach themselves that it means nothing;\r\nthat Lord This does not hate Mr. That, or think him a traitor to his\r\ncountry, or wish to crucify him; and that Sir John of the Treasury\r\nis not much in earnest when he speaks of his noble friend at the\r\n"Foreign Office" as a god to whom no other god was ever comparable in\r\nhonesty, discretion, patriotism, and genius. But the outside Briton\r\nwho takes a delight in politics,--and this description should include\r\nninety-nine educated Englishmen out of every hundred,--should not be\r\ndesirous of peeping behind the scenes. No beholder at any theatre\r\nshould do so. It is good to believe in these friendships and these\r\nenmities, and very pleasant to watch their changes. It is delightful\r\nwhen Oxford embraces Manchester, finding that it cannot live without\r\nsupport in that quarter; and very delightful when the uncompromising\r\nassailant of all men in power receives the legitimate reward of his\r\nenergy by being taken in among the bosoms of the blessed.\r\n\r\nBut although the outer world was so sure that the existing Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer had ceased to exist, when the House of Commons met\r\nthat gentleman took his seat on the Treasury Bench. Mr. Palliser, who\r\nhad by no means given a general support to the Ministry in the last\r\nSession, took his seat on the same side of the House indeed, but low\r\ndown, and near to the cross benches. Mr. Bott sat close behind him,\r\nand men knew that Mr. Bott was a distinguished member of Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nparty, whatever that party might be. Lord Cinquebars moved the\r\nAddress, and I must confess that he did it very lamely. He was\r\nonce accused by Mr. Maxwell, the brewer, of making a great noise in\r\nthe hunting-field. The accusation could not be repeated as to his\r\nperformance on this occasion, as no one could hear a word that he\r\nsaid. The Address was seconded by Mr. Loftus Fitzhoward, a nephew of\r\nthe Duke of St. Bungay, who spoke as though he were resolved to trump\r\npoor Lord Cinquebars in every sentence which he pronounced,--as we\r\nso often hear the second clergyman from the Communion Table trumping\r\nhis weary predecessor, who has just finished the Litany not in the\r\nclearest or most audible voice. Every word fell from Mr. Fitzhoward\r\nwith the elaborate accuracy of a separate pistol-shot; and as he\r\nbecame pleased with himself in his progress, and warm with his work,\r\nhe accented his words sharply, made rhetorical pauses, even moved his\r\nhands about in action, and quite disgusted his own party, who had\r\nbeen very well satisfied with Lord Cinquebars. There are many rocks\r\nwhich a young speaker in Parliament should avoid, but no rock which\r\nrequires such careful avoiding as the rock of eloquence. Whatever\r\nmay be his faults, let him at least avoid eloquence. He should\r\nnot be inaccurate, which, however, is not much; he should not be\r\nlong-winded, which is a good deal; he should not be ill-tempered,\r\nwhich is more; but none of these faults are so damnable as eloquence.\r\nAll Mr. Fitzhoward\'s friends and all his enemies knew that he had had\r\nhis chance, and that he had thrown it away.\r\n\r\nIn the Queen\'s Speech there had been some very lukewarm allusion to\r\nremission of direct taxation. This remission, which had already been\r\ncarried so far, should be carried further if such further carrying\r\nwere found practicable. So had said the Queen. Those words, it was\r\nknown, could not have been approved of by the energetic and still\r\nexisting Chancellor of the Exchequer. On this subject the mover\r\nof the Address said never a word, and the seconder only a word or\r\ntwo. What they had said had, of course, been laid down for them;\r\nthough, unfortunately, the manner of saying could not be so easily\r\nprescribed. Then there arose a great enemy, a man fluent of diction,\r\napparently with deep malice at his heart, though at home,--as we used\r\nto say at school,--one of the most good-natured fellows in the world;\r\none ambitious of that godship which a seat on the other side of\r\nthe House bestowed, and greedy to grasp at the chances which this\r\ndisagreement in the councils of the gods might give him. He was quite\r\ncontent, he said, to vote for the Address, as, he believed, would be\r\nall the gentlemen on his side of the House. No one could suspect them\r\nor him of giving a factious opposition to Government. Had they not\r\nborne and forborne beyond all precedent known in that House? Then\r\nhe touched lightly, and almost with grace to his opponents, on many\r\nsubjects, promising support, and barely hinting that they were\r\ntotally and manifestly wrong in all things. But--. Then the tone of\r\nhis voice changed, and the well-known look of fury was assumed upon\r\nhis countenance. Then great Jove on the other side pulled his hat\r\nover his eyes, and smiled blandly. Then members put away the papers\r\nthey had been reading for a moment, and men in the gallery began\r\nto listen. But--. The long and the short of it was this; that the\r\nexisting Government had come into power on the cry of a reduction\r\nof taxation, and now they were going to shirk the responsibility\r\nof their own measures. They were going to shirk the responsibility\r\nof their own election cry, although it was known that their own\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to carry it out to the full.\r\nHe was willing to carry it out to the full were he not restrained by\r\nthe timidity, falsehood, and treachery of his colleagues, of whom,\r\nof course, the most timid, the most false, and the most treacherous\r\nwas--the great god Jove, who sat blandly smiling on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great Jove.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one should ever go near the House of Commons who wishes to enjoy\r\nall this. It was so manifestly evident that neither Jove nor any\r\nof his satellites cared twopence for what the irate gentleman was\r\nsaying; nay, it became so evident that, in spite of his assumed fury,\r\nthe gentleman was not irate. He intended to communicate his look\r\nof anger to the newspaper reports of his speech; and he knew from\r\nexperience that he could succeed in that. And men walked about the\r\nHouse in the most telling moments,--enemies shaking hands with\r\nenemies,--in a way that showed an entire absence of all good, honest\r\nhatred among them. But the gentleman went on and finished his speech,\r\ndemanding at last, in direct terms, that the Treasury Jove should\r\nstate plainly to the House who was to be, and who was not to be, the\r\nbearer of the purse among the gods.\r\n\r\nThen Treasury Jove got up smiling, and thanked his enemy for the\r\ncordiality of his support. "He had always," he said, "done the\r\ngentleman\'s party justice for their clemency, and had feared no\r\nopposition from them; and he was glad to find that he was correct in\r\nhis anticipations as to the course they would pursue on the present\r\noccasion." He went on saying a good deal about home matters, and\r\nforeign matters, proving that everything was right, just as easily as\r\nhis enemy had proved that everything was wrong. On all these points\r\nhe was very full, and very courteous; but when he came to the subject\r\nof taxation, he simply repeated the passage from the Queen\'s Speech,\r\nexpressing a hope that his right honourable friend, the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, would be able to satisfy the judgement of the House,\r\nand the wishes of the people. That specially personal question which\r\nhad been asked he did not answer at all.\r\n\r\nBut the House was still all agog, as was the crowded gallery. The\r\nenergetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer was then\r\npresent, divided only by one little thin Secretary of State from Jove\r\nhimself. Would he get up and declare his purposes? He was a man who\r\nalmost always did get up when an opportunity offered itself,--or when\r\nit did not. Some second little gun was fired off from the Opposition\r\nbenches, and then there was a pause. Would the purse-bearer of\r\nOlympus rise upon his wings and speak his mind, or would he sit\r\nin silence upon his cloud? There was a general call for the\r\npurse-bearer, but he floated in silence, and was inexplicable. The\r\npurse-bearer was not to be bullied into any sudden reading of the\r\nriddle. Then there came on a general debate about money matters, in\r\nwhich the purse-bearer did say a few words, but he said nothing as\r\nto the great question at issue. At last up got Mr. Palliser, towards\r\nthe close of the evening, and occupied a full hour in explaining what\r\ntaxes the Government might remit with safety, and what they might\r\nnot,--Mr. Bott, meanwhile, prompting him with figures from behind\r\nwith an assiduity that was almost too persistent. According to Mr.\r\nPalliser, the words used in the Queen\'s Speech were not at all too\r\ncautious. The Members went out gradually, and the House became very\r\nthin during this oration; but the newspapers declared, next morning,\r\nthat his speech had been the speech of the night, and that the\r\nperspicuity of Mr. Palliser pointed him out as the coming man.\r\n\r\nHe returned home to his house in Park Lane quite triumphant after his\r\nsuccess, and found Lady Glencora, at about twelve o\'clock, sitting\r\nalone. She had arrived in town on that day, having come up at her own\r\nrequest, instead of remaining at Matching Priory till after Easter,\r\nas he had proposed. He had wished her to stay, in order, as he\r\nhad said, that there might be a home for his cousins. But she had\r\nexpressed herself unwilling to remain without him, explaining that\r\nthe cousins might have the home in her absence, as well as they\r\ncould in her presence; and he had given way. But, in truth, she had\r\nlearned to hate her cousin Iphy Palliser with a hatred that was\r\nunreasonable,--seeing that she did not also hate Alice Vavasor, who\r\nhad done as much to merit her hatred as had her cousin. Lady Glencora\r\nknew by what means her absence from Monkshade had been brought about.\r\nMiss Palliser had told her all that had passed in Alice\'s bedroom\r\non the last night of Alice\'s stay at Matching, and had, by so doing,\r\ncontrived to prevent the visit. Lady Glencora understood well all\r\nthat Alice had said: and yet, though she hated Miss Palliser for what\r\nhad been done, she entertained no anger against Alice. Of course\r\nAlice would have prevented that visit to Monkshade if it were in her\r\npower to do so. Of course she would save her friend. It is hardly\r\ntoo much to say that Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her.\r\nNevertheless she hated Iphy Palliser for engaging herself in the same\r\nbusiness. Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her, and yet it may\r\nbe doubted whether she did, in truth, wish to be saved.\r\n\r\nWhile she was at Matching, and before Mr. Palliser had returned from\r\nMonkshade, a letter reached her, by what means she had never learned.\r\n"A letter has been placed within my writing-case," she said to her\r\nmaid, quite openly. "Who put it there?" The maid had declared her\r\nignorance in a manner that had satisfied Lady Glencora of her truth.\r\n"If such a thing happens again," said Lady Glencora, "I shall be\r\nobliged to have the matter investigated. I cannot allow that anything\r\nshould be put into my room surreptitiously." There, then, had been an\r\nend of that, as regarded any steps taken by Lady Glencora. The letter\r\nhad been from Burgo Fitzgerald, and had contained a direct proposal\r\nthat she should go off with him. "I am at Matching," the letter said,\r\n"at the Inn; but I do not dare to show myself, lest I should do you\r\nan injury. I walked round the house yesterday, at night, and I know\r\nthat I saw your room. If I am wrong in thinking that you love me, I\r\nwould not for worlds insult you by my presence; but if you love me\r\nstill, I ask you to throw aside from you that fictitious marriage,\r\nand give yourself to the man whom, if you love him, you should regard\r\nas your husband." There had been more of it, but it had been to the\r\nsame effect. To Lady Glencora it had seemed to convey an assurance\r\nof devoted love,--of that love which, in former days, her friends\r\nhad told her was not within the compass of Burgo\'s nature. He had\r\nnot asked her to meet him then, but saying that he would return to\r\nMatching after Parliament was met, begged her to let him have some\r\nmeans of knowing whether her heart was true to him.\r\n\r\nShe told no one of the letter, but she kept it, and read it over and\r\nover again in the silence and solitude of her room. She felt that she\r\nwas guilty in thus reading it,--even in keeping it from her husband\'s\r\nknowledge; but though conscious of this guilt, though resolute\r\nalmost in its commission, still she determined not to remain at\r\nMatching after her husband\'s departure,--not to undergo the danger\r\nof remaining there while Burgo Fitzgerald should be in the vicinity.\r\nShe could not analyse her own wishes. She often told herself, as she\r\nhad told Alice, that it would be better for them all that she should\r\ngo away; that in throwing herself even to the dogs, if such must be\r\nthe result, she would do more of good than of harm. She declared to\r\nherself, in the most passionate words she could use, that she loved\r\nthis man with all her heart. She protested that the fault would not\r\nbe hers, but theirs, who had forced her to marry the man she did\r\nnot love. She assured herself that her husband had no affection for\r\nher, and that their marriage was in every respect prejudicial to\r\nhim. She recurred over and over again, in her thoughts, to her own\r\nchildlessness, and to his extreme desire for an heir. "Though I do\r\nsacrifice myself," she would say, "I shall do more of good than harm,\r\nand I cannot be more wretched than I am now." But yet she fled to\r\nLondon because she feared to leave herself at Matching when Burgo\r\nFitzgerald should be there. She sent no answer to his letter. She\r\nmade no preparation for going with him. She longed to see Alice, to\r\nwhom alone, since her marriage, had she ever spoken of her love, and\r\nintended to tell her the whole tale of that letter. She was as one\r\nwho, in madness, was resolute to throw herself from a precipice, but\r\nto whom some remnant of sanity remained which forced her to seek\r\nthose who would save her from herself.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser had not seen her since her arrival in London, and,\r\nof course, he took her by the hand and kissed her. But it was the\r\nembrace of a brother rather than of a lover or a husband. Lady\r\nGlencora, with her full woman\'s nature, understood this thoroughly,\r\nand appreciated by instinct the true bearing of every touch from his\r\nhand. "I hope you are well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; quite well. And you? A little fatigued with your journey, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"No; not much."\r\n\r\n"Well, we have had a debate on the Address. Don\'t you want to know\r\nhow it has gone?"\r\n\r\n"If it has concerned you particularly, I do, of course."\r\n\r\n"Concerned me! It has concerned me certainly."\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t appointed you yet; have they?"\r\n\r\n"No; they don\'t appoint people during debates, in the House of\r\nCommons. But I fear I shall never make you a politician."\r\n\r\n"I\'m almost afraid you never will. But I\'m not the less anxious for\r\nyour success, since you wish it yourself. I don\'t understand why you\r\nshould work so very hard; but, as you like it, I\'m as anxious as\r\nanybody can be that you should triumph."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I do like it," he said. "A man must like something, and I don\'t\r\nknow what there is to like better. Some people can eat and drink all\r\nday; and some people can care about a horse. I can do neither."\r\n\r\nAnd there were others, Lady Glencora thought, who could love to lie\r\nin the sun, and could look up into the eyes of women, and seek their\r\nhappiness there. She was sure, at any rate, that she knew one such.\r\nBut she said nothing of this.\r\n\r\n"I spoke for a moment to Lord Brock," said Mr. Palliser. Lord Brock\r\nwas the name by which the present Jove of the Treasury was known\r\namong men.\r\n\r\n"And what did Lord Brock say?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t say much, but he was very cordial."\r\n\r\n"But I thought, Plantagenet, that he could appoint you if he pleased?\r\nDoesn\'t he do it all?"\r\n\r\n"Well, in one sense, he does. But I don\'t suppose I shall ever make\r\nyou understand." He endeavoured, however, to do so on the present\r\noccasion, and gave her a somewhat longer lecture on the working of\r\nthe British Constitution, and the manner in which British politics\r\nevolved themselves, than would have been expected from most young\r\nhusbands to their young wives under similar circumstances. Lady\r\nGlencora yawned, and strove lustily, but ineffectually, to hide her\r\nyawn in her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"But I see you don\'t care a bit about it," said he, peevishly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be angry, Plantagenet. Indeed I do care about it, but I am so\r\nignorant that I can\'t understand it all at once. I am rather tired,\r\nand I think I\'ll go to bed now. Shall you be late?"\r\n\r\n"No, not very; that is, I shall be rather late. I\'ve a lot of\r\nletters I want to write to-night, as I must be at work all to-morrow.\r\nBy-the-by, Mr. Bott is coming to dine here. There will be no one\r\nelse." The next day was a Wednesday, and the House would not sit in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott!" said Lady Glencora, showing by her voice that she\r\nanticipated no pleasure from that gentleman\'s company.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Bott. Have you any objection?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Would you like to dine alone with him?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I dine alone with him? Why shouldn\'t you eat your dinner\r\nwith us? I hope you are not going to become fastidious, and to turn\r\nup your nose at people. Mrs. Marsham is in town, and I dare say she\'ll\r\ncome to you if you ask her."\r\n\r\nBut this was too much for Lady Glencora. She was disposed to be mild,\r\nbut she could not endure to have her two duennas thus brought upon\r\nher together on the first day of her arrival in London. And Mrs.\r\nMarsham would be worse than Mr. Bott. Mr. Bott would be engaged with\r\nMr. Palliser during the greater part of the evening. "I thought," said\r\nshe, "of asking my cousin, Alice Vavasor, to spend the evening with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Miss Vavasor!" said the husband. "I must say that I thought Miss\r\nVavasor--" He was going to make some allusion to that unfortunate\r\nhour spent among the ruins, but he stopped himself.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have nothing to say against my cousin?" said his wife.\r\n"She is my only near relative that I really care for;--the only\r\nwoman, I mean."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t mean to say anything against her. She\'s very well as a\r\nyoung lady, I dare say. I would sooner that you would ask Mrs. Marsham\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nLady Glencora was standing, waiting to go away to her own room, but\r\nit was absolutely necessary that this matter should be decided before\r\nshe went. She felt that he was hard to her, and unreasonable, and\r\nthat he was treating her like a child who should not be allowed her\r\nown way in anything. She had endeavoured to please him, and, having\r\nfailed, was not now disposed to give way.\r\n\r\n"As there will be no other ladies here to-morrow evening,\r\nPlantagenet, and as I have not yet seen Alice since I have been in\r\ntown, I wish you would let me have my way in this. Of course I cannot\r\nhave very much to say to Mrs. Marsham, who is an old woman."\r\n\r\n"I especially want Mrs. Marsham to be your friend," said he.\r\n\r\n"Friendships will not come by ordering, Plantagenet," said she.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Friendships will not come by ordering,"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Very well," said he. "Of course, you will do as you please. I am\r\nsorry that you have refused the first favour I have asked you this\r\nyear." Then he left the room, and she went away to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lady Glencora was not brought to repentance by her husband\'s last\r\nwords. It seemed to her to be so intolerably cruel, this demand of\r\nhis, that she should be made to pass the whole of her first evening\r\nin town with an old woman for whom it was impossible that she should\r\nentertain the slightest regard, that she resolved upon rebellion. Had\r\nhe positively ordered Mrs. Marsham, she would have sent for that lady,\r\nand have contented herself with enduring her presence in disdainful\r\nsilence; but Mr. Palliser had not given any order. He had made a\r\nrequest, and a request, from its very nature, admits of no obedience.\r\nThe compliance with a request must be voluntary, and she would not\r\nsend for Mrs. Marsham, except upon compulsion. Had not she also made\r\na request to him, and had not he refused it? It was his prerogative,\r\nundoubtedly, to command; but in that matter of requests she had a\r\nright to expect that her voice should be as potent as his own. She\r\nwrote a line, therefore, to Alice before she went to bed, begging her\r\ncousin to come to her early on the following day, so that they might\r\ngo out together, and then afterwards dine in company with Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\n"I know that will be an inducement to you," Lady Glencora said,\r\n"because your generous heart will feel of what service you may be to\r\nme. Nobody else will be here,--unless, indeed, Mrs. Marsham should be\r\nasked, unknown to myself."\r\n\r\nThen she sat herself down to think,--to think especially about the\r\ncruelty of husbands. She had been told over and over again, in the\r\ndays before her marriage, that Burgo would ill-use her if he became\r\nher husband. The Marquis of Auld Reekie had gone so far as to suggest\r\nthat Burgo might probably beat her. But what hard treatment, even\r\nwhat beating, could be so unendurable as this total want of sympathy,\r\nas this deadness in life, which her present lot entailed upon her? As\r\nfor that matter of beating, she ridiculed the idea in her very soul.\r\nShe sat smiling at the absurdity of the thing as she thought of the\r\nbeauty of Burgo\'s eyes, of the softness of his touch, of the loving,\r\nalmost worshipping, tones of his voice. Would it not even be better\r\nto be beaten by him than to have politics explained to her at one\r\no\'clock at night by such a husband as Plantagenet Palliser? The\r\nBritish Constitution, indeed! Had she married Burgo they would have\r\nbeen in sunny Italy, and he would have told her some other tale than\r\nthat as they sat together under the pale moonlight. She had a little\r\nwater-coloured drawing called Raphael and Fornarina, and she was\r\ninfantine enough to tell herself that the so-called Raphael was like\r\nher Burgo--no, not her Burgo, but the Burgo that was not hers. At any\r\nrate, all the romance of the picture she might have enjoyed had they\r\nallowed her to dispose as she had wished of her own hand. She might\r\nhave sat in marble balconies, while the vines clustered over her\r\nhead, and he would have been at her knee, hardly speaking to her,\r\nbut making his presence felt by the halo of its divinity. He would\r\nhave called upon her for no hard replies. With him near her she would\r\nhave enjoyed the soft air, and would have sat happy, without trouble,\r\nlapped in the delight of loving. It was thus that Fornarina sat. And\r\nwhy should not such a lot have been hers? Her Raphael would have\r\nloved her, let them say what they would about his cruelty.\r\n\r\nPoor, wretched, overburthened child, to whom the commonest lessons of\r\nlife had not yet been taught, and who had now fallen into the hands\r\nof one who was so ill-fitted to teach them! Who would not pity her?\r\nWho could say that the fault was hers? The world had laden her with\r\nwealth till she had had no limb free for its ordinary uses, and then\r\nhad turned her loose to run her race!\r\n\r\n"Have you written to your cousin?" her husband asked her the next\r\nmorning. His voice, as he spoke, clearly showed that his anger was\r\neither over or suppressed.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have asked her to come and drive, and then to stay for\r\ndinner. I shall send the carriage for her if she can come. The man is\r\nto wait for an answer."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Mr. Palliser, mildly. And then, after a short pause,\r\nhe added, "As that is settled, perhaps you would have no objection to\r\nask Mrs. Marsham also?"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t she probably be engaged?"\r\n\r\n"No; I think not," said Mr. Palliser. And then he added, being ashamed\r\nof the tinge of falsehood of which he would otherwise have been\r\nguilty, "I know she is not engaged."\r\n\r\n"She expects to come, then?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I have not asked her, if you mean that, Glencora. Had I done so,\r\nI should have said so. I told her that I did not know what your\r\nengagements were."\r\n\r\n"I will write to her, if you please," said the wife, who felt that\r\nshe could hardly refuse any longer.\r\n\r\n"Do, my dear!" said the husband. So Lady Glencora did write to Mrs.\r\nMarsham, who promised to come,--as did also Alice Vavasor.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora would, at any rate, have Alice to herself for some\r\nhours before dinner. At first she took comfort in that reflection;\r\nbut after a while she bethought herself that she would not know\r\nwhat to tell Alice, or what not to tell. Did she mean to show that\r\nletter to her cousin? If she did show it, then,--so she argued with\r\nherself,--she must bring herself to endure the wretchedness of her\r\npresent lot, and must give up for ever all her dreams about Raphael\r\nand Fornarina. If she did not show it,--or, at any rate, tell of\r\nit,--then it would come to pass that she would leave her husband\r\nunder the protection of another man, and she would become--what she\r\ndid not dare to name even to herself. She declared that so it must\r\nbe. She knew that she would go with Burgo, should he ever come to her\r\nwith the means of going at his and her instant command. But should\r\nshe bring herself to let Alice know that such a letter had been\r\nconveyed to her, Burgo would never have such power.\r\n\r\nI remember the story of a case of abduction in which a man was tried\r\nfor his life, and was acquitted, because the lady had acquiesced in\r\nthe carrying away while it was in progress. She had, as she herself\r\ndeclared, armed herself with a sure and certain charm or talisman\r\nagainst such dangers, which she kept suspended round her neck; but\r\nwhilst she was in the post-chaise she opened the window and threw\r\nthe charm from her, no longer desiring, as the learned counsel for\r\nthe defence efficiently alleged, to be kept under the bonds of such\r\nprotection. Lady Glencora\'s state of mind was, in its nature, nearly\r\nthe same as that of the lady in the post-chaise. Whether or no she\r\nwould use her charm, she had not yet decided, but the power of doing\r\nso was still hers.\r\n\r\nAlice came, and the greeting between the cousins was very\r\naffectionate. Lady Glencora received her as though they had been\r\nplaymates from early childhood; and Alice, though such impulsive love\r\nwas not natural to her as to the other, could not bring herself to\r\nbe cold to one who was so warm to her. Indeed, had she not promised\r\nher love in that meeting at Matching Priory in which her cousin\r\nhad told her of all her wretchedness? "I will love you!" Alice had\r\nsaid; and though there was much in Lady Glencora that she could not\r\napprove,--much even that she could not bring herself to like,--still\r\nshe would not allow her heart to contradict her words.\r\n\r\nThey sat so long over the fire in the drawing-room that at last they\r\nagreed that the driving should be abandoned.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of it?" said Lady Glencora. "There\'s nothing to see,\r\nand the wind is as cold as charity. We are much more comfortable\r\nhere; are we not?" Alice quite acquiesced in this, having no great\r\ndesire to be driven through the parks in the gloom of a February\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n"If I had Dandy and Flirt up here, there would be some fun in it; but\r\nMr. Palliser doesn\'t wish me to drive in London."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it would be dangerous?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I don\'t think it\'s that he minds; but he has an\r\nidea that it looks fast."\r\n\r\n"So it does. If I were a man, I\'m sure I shouldn\'t like my wife to\r\ndrive horses about London."\r\n\r\n"And why not? Just because you\'d be a tyrant,--like other husbands?\r\nWhat\'s the harm of looking fast, if one doesn\'t do anything improper?\r\nPoor Dandy, and dear Flirt! I\'m sure they\'d like it."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Mr. Palliser doesn\'t care for that?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you something else he doesn\'t care for. He doesn\'t care\r\nwhether Dandy\'s mistress likes it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, Glencora."\r\n\r\n"Why not say it,--to you?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t teach yourself to think it. That\'s what I mean. I believe he\r\nwould consent to anything that he didn\'t think wrong."\r\n\r\n"Such as lectures about the British Constitution! But never mind\r\nabout that, Alice. Of course the British Constitution is everything\r\nto him, and I wish I knew more about it;--that\'s all. But I haven\'t\r\ntold you whom you are to meet at dinner."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have--Mr. Bott."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s another guest, a Mrs. Marsham. I thought I\'d got rid of\r\nher for to-day, when I wrote to you; but I hadn\'t. She\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t hurt me at all," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"She will hurt me very much. She\'ll destroy the pleasure of our whole\r\nevening. I do believe that she hates you, and that she thinks you\r\ninstigate me to all manner of iniquity. What fools they all are!"\r\n\r\n"Who are they all, Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"She and that man, and--. Never mind. It makes me sick when I think\r\nthat they should be so blind. Alice, I hardly know how much I owe to\r\nyou; I don\'t, indeed. Everything, I believe." Lady Glencora, as she\r\nspoke, put her hand into her pocket, and grasped the letter which lay\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s not nonsense. Who do you think came to Matching when I was\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"What;--to the house?" said Alice, feeling almost certain that Mr.\r\nFitzgerald was the person to whom Lady Glencora was alluding.\r\n\r\n"No; not to the house."\r\n\r\n"If it is the person of whom I am thinking," said Alice, solemnly,\r\n"let me implore you not to speak of him."\r\n\r\n"And why should I not speak of him? Did I not speak of him before to\r\nyou, and was it not for good? How are you to be my friend, if I may\r\nnot speak to you of everything?"\r\n\r\n"But you should not think of him."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense you talk, Alice! Not think of him! How is one to help\r\none\'s thoughts? Look here."\r\n\r\nHer hand was on the letter, and it would have been out in a moment,\r\nand thrown upon Alice\'s lap, had not the servant opened the door and\r\nannounced Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how I do wish we had gone to drive!" said Lady Glencora, in a\r\nvoice which the servant certainly heard, and which Mrs. Marsham would\r\nhave heard had she not been a little hard of hearing,--in her bonnet.\r\n\r\n"How do, my dear?" said Mrs. Marsham. "I thought I\'d just come across\r\nfrom Norfolk Street and see you, though I am coming to dinner in the\r\nevening. It\'s only just a step, you know. How d\'ye do, Miss Vavasor?"\r\nand she made a salutation to Alice which was nearly as cold as it\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham was a woman who had many good points. She was poor,\r\nand bore her poverty without complaint She was connected by blood\r\nand friendship with people rich and titled; but she paid to none of\r\nthem egregious respect on account of their wealth or titles. She was\r\nstaunch in her friendships, and staunch in her enmities. She was\r\nno fool, and knew well what was going on in the world. She could\r\ntalk about the last novel, or--if need be--about the Constitution.\r\nShe had been a true wife, though sometimes too strong-minded, and a\r\npainstaking mother, whose children, however, had never loved her as\r\nmost mothers like to be loved.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of her faults must be quite as long as that of her\r\nvirtues. She was one of those women who are ambitious of power, and\r\nnot very scrupulous as to the manner in which they obtain it. She\r\nwas hardhearted, and capable of pursuing an object without much\r\nregard to the injury she might do. She would not flatter wealth or\r\nfawn before a title, but she was not above any artifice by which she\r\nmight ingratiate herself with those whom it suited her purpose to\r\nconciliate. She thought evil rather than good. She was herself untrue\r\nin action, if not absolutely in word. I do not say that she would\r\ncoin lies, but she would willingly leave false impressions. She had\r\nbeen the bosom friend, and in many things the guide in life, of Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s mother; and she took a special interest in Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nwelfare. When he married, she heard the story of the loves of Burgo\r\nand Lady Glencora; and though she thought well of the money, she\r\nwas not disposed to think very well of the bride. She made up her\r\nmind that the young lady would want watching, and she was of opinion\r\nthat no one would be so well able to watch Lady Glencora as herself.\r\nShe had not plainly opened her mind on this matter to Mr. Palliser;\r\nshe had not made any distinct suggestion to him that she would act\r\nas Argus to his wife. Mr. Palliser would have rejected any such\r\nsuggestion, and Mrs. Marsham knew that he would do so; but she\r\nhad let a word or two drop, hinting that Lady Glencora was very\r\nyoung,--hinting that Lady Glencora\'s manners were charming in their\r\nchildlike simplicity; but hinting also that precaution was, for that\r\nreason, the more necessary. Mr. Palliser, who suspected nothing as\r\nto Burgo or as to any other special peril, whose whole disposition\r\nwas void of suspicion, whose dry nature realized neither the delights\r\nnor the dangers of love, acknowledged that Glencora was young. He\r\nespecially wished that she should be discreet and matronly; he feared\r\nno lovers, but he feared that she might do silly things,--that\r\nshe would catch cold,--and not know how to live a life becoming\r\nthe wife of a Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore he submitted\r\nGlencora,--and, to a certain extent, himself,--into the hands of Mrs.\r\nMarsham.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora had not been twenty-four hours in the house with this\r\nlady before she recognized in her a duenna. In all such matters no\r\none could be quicker than Lady Glencora. She might be very ignorant\r\nabout the British Constitution, and, alas! very ignorant also as to\r\nthe real elements of right and wrong in a woman\'s conduct, but she\r\nwas no fool. She had an eye that could see, and an ear that could\r\nunderstand, and an abundance of that feminine instinct which teaches\r\na woman to know her friend or her enemy at a glance, at a touch, at\r\na word. In many things Lady Glencora was much quicker, much more\r\nclever, than her husband, though he was to be Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and though she did know nothing of the Constitution.\r\nShe knew, too, that he was easily to be deceived,--that though his\r\nintelligence was keen, his instincts were dull,--that he was gifted\r\nwith no fineness of touch, with no subtle appreciation of the\r\ncharacters of men and women; and, to a certain extent, she looked\r\ndown upon him for his obtusity. He should have been aware that Burgo\r\nwas a danger to be avoided; and he should have been aware also that\r\nMrs. Marsham was a duenna not to be employed. When a woman knows that\r\nshe is guarded by a watch-dog, she is bound to deceive her Cerberus,\r\nif it be possible, and is usually not ill-disposed to deceive also\r\nthe owner of Cerberus. Lady Glencora felt that Mrs. Marsham was her\r\nCerberus, and she was heartily resolved that if she was to be kept in\r\nthe proper line at all, she would not be so kept by Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\nAlice rose and accepted Mrs. Marsham\'s salutation quite as coldly as\r\nit had been given, and from that time forward those two ladies were\r\nenemies. Mrs. Marsham, groping quite in the dark, partly guessed that\r\nAlice had in some way interfered to prevent Lady Glencora\'s visit to\r\nMonkshade, and, though such prevention was, no doubt, good in that\r\nlady\'s eyes, she resented the interference. She had made up her mind\r\nthat Alice was not the sort of friend that Lady Glencora should have\r\nabout her. Alice recognized and accepted the feud.\r\n\r\n"I thought I might find you at home," said Mrs. Marsham, "as I know\r\nyou are lazy about going out in the cold,--unless it be for a foolish\r\nmidnight ramble," and Mrs. Marsham shook her head. She was a little\r\nwoman, with sharp small eyes, with a permanent colour in her face,\r\nand two short, crisp, grey curls at each side of her face; always\r\nwell dressed, always in good health, and, as Lady Glencora believed,\r\naltogether incapable of fatigue.\r\n\r\n"The ramble you speak of was very wise, I think," said Lady Glencora;\r\n"but I never could see the use of driving about in London in the\r\nmiddle of winter."\r\n\r\n"One ought to go out of the house every day," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"I hate all those rules. Don\'t you, Alice?" Alice did not hate them,\r\ntherefore she said nothing.\r\n\r\n"My dear Glencora, one must live by rules in this life. You might as\r\nwell say that you hated sitting down to dinner."\r\n\r\n"So I do, very often; almost always when there\'s company."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get over that feeling after another season in town," said Mrs.\r\nMarsham, pretending to suppose that Lady Glencora alluded to some\r\nremaining timidity in receiving her own guests.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t think I shall. It\'s a thing that seems always\r\nto be getting more grievous, instead of less so. Mr. Bott is coming to\r\ndine here to-night."\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the meaning of this. There was no pretending\r\neven to mistake it. Now, Mrs. Marsham had accepted the right hand\r\nof fellowship from Mr. Bott,--not because she especially liked him,\r\nbut in compliance with the apparent necessities of Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nposition. Mr. Bott had made good his ground about Mr. Palliser; and Mrs.\r\nMarsham, as she was not strong enough to turn him off from it, had\r\ngiven him the right hand of fellowship.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott is a Member of Parliament, and a very serviceable friend of\r\nMr. Palliser\'s," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"All the same; we do not like Mr. Bott--do we, Alice? He is Doctor\r\nFell to us; only I think we could tell why."\r\n\r\n"I certainly do not like him," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"It can be but of small matter to you, Miss Vavasor," said Mrs.\r\nMarsham, "as you will not probably have to see much of him."\r\n\r\n"Of the very smallest moment," said Alice. "He did annoy me once, but\r\nwill never, I dare say, have an opportunity of doing so again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what the annoyance may have been."\r\n\r\n"Of course you don\'t, Mrs. Marsham."\r\n\r\n"But I shouldn\'t have thought it likely that a person so fully\r\nemployed as Mr. Bott, and employed, too, on matters of such vast\r\nimportance, would have gone out of his way to annoy a young lady whom\r\nhe chanced to meet for a day or two in a country-house."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that Alice means that he attempted to flirt with her,"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora, laughing. "Fancy Mr. Bott\'s flirtation!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he did not attempt," said Mrs. Marsham; and the words, the\r\ntone, and the innuendo together were more than Alice was able to bear\r\nwith equanimity.\r\n\r\n"Glencora," said she, rising from her chair, "I think I\'ll leave\r\nyou alone with Mrs. Marsham. I\'m not disposed to discuss Mr. Bott\'s\r\ncharacter, and certainly not to hear his name mentioned in\r\ndisagreeable connection with my own."\r\n\r\nBut Lady Glencora would not let her go. "Nonsense, Alice," she said.\r\n"If you and I can\'t fight our little battles against Mr. Bott and Mrs.\r\nMarsham without running away, it is odd. There is a warfare in which\r\nthey who run away never live to fight another day."\r\n\r\n"I hope, Glencora, you do not count me as your enemy?" said Mrs.\r\nMarsham, drawing herself up.\r\n\r\n"But I shall,--certainly, if you attack Alice. Love me, love my dog.\r\nI beg your pardon, Alice; but what I meant was this, Mrs. Marsham;\r\nLove me, love the best friend I have in the world."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to offend Miss Vavasor," said Mrs. Marsham, looking at\r\nher very grimly. Alice merely bowed her head. She had been offended,\r\nand she would not deny it. After that, Mrs. Marsham took herself\r\noff, saying that she would be back to dinner. She was angry, but\r\nnot unhappy. She thought that she could put down Miss Vavasor, and\r\nshe was prepared to bear a good deal from Lady Glencora--for Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s sake, as she said to herself, with some attempt at a\r\nsentimental remembrance of her old friend.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a nasty old cat," said Lady Glencora, as soon as the door was\r\nclosed; and she said these words with so droll a voice, with such a\r\nchildlike shaking of her head, with so much comedy in her grimace,\r\nthat Alice could not but laugh. "She is," said Lady Glencora. "I know\r\nher, and you\'ll have to know her, too, before you\'ve done with her.\r\nIt won\'t at all do for you to run away when she spits at you. You\r\nmust hold your ground, and show your claws,--and make her know that\r\nif she spits, you can scratch."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to be a cat myself."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll find I\'m of the genus, but of the tiger kind, if she\r\npersecutes me. Alice, there\'s one thing I have made up my mind about.\r\nI will not be persecuted. If my husband tells me to do anything, as\r\nlong as he is my husband I\'ll do it; but I won\'t be persecuted."\r\n\r\n"You should remember that she was a very old friend of Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nmother."\r\n\r\n"I do remember; and that may be a very good reason why she should\r\ncome here occasionally, or go to Matching, or to any place in which\r\nwe may be living. It\'s a bore, of course; but it\'s a natural bore,\r\nand one that ought to be borne."\r\n\r\n"And that will be the beginning and the end of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, my dear. It may perhaps be the end of it, but I fear\r\nit won\'t be the beginning. I won\'t be persecuted. If she gives me\r\nadvice, I shall tell her to her face that it\'s not wanted; and if she\r\ninsults any friend of mine, as she did you, I shall tell her that she\r\nhad better stay away. She\'ll go and tell him, of course; but I can\'t\r\nhelp that. I\'ve made up my mind that I won\'t be persecuted."\r\n\r\nAfter that, Lady Glencora felt no further inclination to show Burgo\'s\r\nletter to Alice on that occasion. They sat over the drawing-room\r\nfire, talking chiefly of Alice\'s affairs, till it was time for them\r\nto dress. But Alice, though she spoke much of Mr. Grey, said no word\r\nas to her engagement with George Vavasor. How could she speak of it,\r\ninasmuch as she had already resolved,--already almost resolved,--that\r\nthat engagement also should be broken?\r\n\r\nAlice, when she came down to the drawing-room, before dinner, found\r\nMr. Bott there alone. She had dressed more quickly than her friend,\r\nand Mr. Palliser had not yet made his appearance.\r\n\r\n"I did not expect the pleasure of meeting Miss Vavasor to-day," he\r\nsaid, as he came up, offering his hand. She gave him her hand, and\r\nthen sat down, merely muttering some word of reply.\r\n\r\n"We spent a very pleasant month down at Matching together;--didn\'t\r\nyou think so?"\r\n\r\n"I spent a pleasant month there certainly."\r\n\r\n"You left, if I remember, the morning after that late walk out among\r\nthe ruins? That was unfortunate, was it not? Poor Lady Glencora! it\r\nmade her very ill; so much so, that she could not go to Monkshade,\r\nas she particularly wished. It was very sad. Lady Glencora is very\r\ndelicate,--very delicate, indeed. We, who have the privilege of being\r\nnear her, ought always to remember that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she is at all delicate."\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t you? I\'m afraid that\'s your mistake, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"I believe she has very good health, which is the greatest blessing\r\nin the world. By delicate I suppose you mean weak and infirm."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no,--not in the least,--not infirm certainly! I should be\r\nvery sorry to be supposed to have said that Lady Glencora is infirm.\r\nWhat I mean is, not robust, Miss Vavasor. Her general organization,\r\nif you understand me, is exquisitely delicate. One can see that, I\r\nthink, in every glance of her eye."\r\n\r\nAlice was going to protest that she had never seen it at all, when Mr.\r\nPalliser entered the room along with Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen shook hands, and then Mr. Palliser turned to Alice.\r\nShe perceived at once by his face that she was unwelcome, and wished\r\nherself away from his house. It might be all very well for Lady\r\nGlencora to fight with Mrs. Marsham,--and with her husband, too, in\r\nregard to the Marsham persecution,--but there could be no reason why\r\nshe should do so. He just touched her hand, barely closing his thumb\r\nupon her fingers, and asked her how she was. Then he turned away from\r\nher side of the fire, and began talking to Mrs. Marsham on the other.\r\nThere was that in his face and in his manner which was positively\r\noffensive to her. He made no allusion to his former acquaintance with\r\nher,--spoke no word about Matching, no word about his wife, as he\r\nwould naturally have done to his wife\'s friend. Alice felt the blood\r\nmount into her face, and regretted greatly that she had ever come\r\namong these people. Had she not long since made up her mind that she\r\nwould avoid her great relations, and did not all this prove that it\r\nwould have been well for her to have clung to that resolution? What\r\nwas Lady Glencora to her that she should submit herself to be treated\r\nas though she were a poor companion,--a dependent, who received a\r\nsalary for her attendance,--an indigent cousin, hanging on to the\r\nbounty of her rich connection? Alice was proud to a fault. She had\r\nnursed her pride till it was very faulty. All her troubles and\r\nsorrows in life had come from an overfed craving for independence.\r\nWhy, then, should she submit to be treated with open want of courtesy\r\nby any man; but, of all men, why should she submit to it from such a\r\none as Mr. Palliser,--the heir of a ducal house, rolling in wealth,\r\nand magnificent with all the magnificence of British pomp and pride?\r\nNo; she would make Lady Glencora understand that the close intimacies\r\nof daily life were not possible to them!\r\n\r\n"I declare I\'m very much ashamed," said Lady Glencora, as she entered\r\nthe room. "I shan\'t apologize to you, Alice, for it was you who kept\r\nme talking; but I do beg Mrs. Marsham\'s pardon."\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham was all smiles and forgiveness, and hoped that Lady\r\nGlencora would not make a stranger of her. Then dinner was announced,\r\nand Alice had to walk down stairs by herself. She did not care a\r\ndoit for that, but there had been a disagreeable little contest when\r\nthe moment came. Lady Glencora had wished to give up Mr. Bott to her\r\ncousin, but Mr. Bott had stuck manfully to Lady Glencora\'s side. He\r\nhoped to take Lady Glencora down to dinner very often, and was not at\r\nall disposed to abate his privilege.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner-time Alice said very little, nor was there given to her\r\nopportunity of saying much. She could not but think of the day of her\r\nfirst arrival at Matching Priory, when she had sat between the Duke\r\nof St. Bungay and Jeffrey Palliser, and when everybody had been so\r\ncivil to her! She now occupied one side of the table by herself,\r\naway from the fire, where she felt cold and desolate in the gloom of\r\nthe large half-lighted room. Mr. Palliser occupied himself with Mrs.\r\nMarsham, who talked politics to him; and Mr. Bott never lost a moment\r\nin his endeavours to say some civil word to Lady Glencora. Lady\r\nGlencora gave him no encouragement; but she hardly dared to snub\r\nhim openly in her husband\'s immediate presence. Twenty times during\r\ndinner she said some little word to Alice, attempting at first to\r\nmake the time pleasant, and then, when the matter was too far gone\r\nfor that, attempting to give some relief. But it was of no avail.\r\nThere are moments in which conversation seems to be impossible,--in\r\nwhich the very gods interfere to put a seal upon the lips of the\r\nunfortunate one. It was such a moment now with Alice. She had never\r\nas yet been used to snubbing. Whatever position she had hitherto\r\nheld, in that she had always stood foremost,--much more so than had\r\nbeen good for her. When she had gone to Matching, she had trembled\r\nfor her position; but there all had gone well with her; there\r\nLady Glencora\'s kindness had at first been able to secure for\r\nher a reception that had been flattering, and almost better than\r\nflattering. Jeffrey Palliser had been her friend, and would, had she\r\nso willed it, have been more than her friend. But now she felt that\r\nthe halls of the Pallisers were too cold for her, and that the sooner\r\nshe escaped from their gloom and hard discourtesy the better for her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham, when the three ladies had returned to the drawing-room\r\ntogether, was a little triumphant. She felt that she had put Alice\r\ndown; and with the energetic prudence of a good general who knows\r\nthat he should follow up a victory, let the cost of doing so be what\r\nit may, she determined to keep her down. Alice had resolved that she\r\nwould come as seldom as might be to Mr. Palliser\'s house in Park\r\nLane. That resolution on her part was in close accordance with Mrs.\r\nMarsham\'s own views.\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Vavasor going to walk home?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Walk home;--all along Oxford Street! Good gracious! no. Why should\r\nshe walk? The carriage will take her."\r\n\r\n"Or a cab," said Alice. "I am quite used to go about London in a cab\r\nby myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they are nice for young ladies after dark," said Mrs.\r\nMarsham. "I was going to offer my servant to walk with her. She is an\r\nelderly woman, and would not mind it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Alice is very much obliged," said Lady. Glencora; "but she\r\nwill have the carriage."\r\n\r\n"You are very good-natured," said Mrs. Marsham; "but gentlemen do so\r\ndislike having their horses out at night."\r\n\r\n"No gentleman\'s horses will be out," said Lady Glencora, savagely;\r\n"and as for mine, it\'s what they are there for." It was not often\r\nthat Lady Glencora made any allusion to her own property, or allowed\r\nany one near her to suppose that she remembered the fact that her\r\nhusband\'s great wealth was, in truth, her wealth. As to many matters\r\nher mind was wrong. In some things her taste was not delicate as\r\nshould be that of a woman. But, as regarded her money, no woman could\r\nhave behaved with greater reticence, or a purer delicacy. But now,\r\nwhen she was twitted by her husband\'s special friend with ill-usage\r\nto her husband\'s horses, because she chose to send her own friend\r\nhome in her own carriage, she did find it hard to bear.\r\n\r\n"I dare say it\'s all right," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"It is all right," said Lady Glencora. "Mr. Palliser has given me my\r\nhorses for my own use, to do as I like with them; and if he thinks I\r\ntake them out when they ought to be left at home, he can tell me so.\r\nNobody else has a right to do it." Lady Glencora, by this time, was\r\nalmost in a passion, and showed that she was so.\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Glencora, you have mistaken me," said Mrs. Marsham; "I\r\ndid not mean anything of that kind."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry," said Alice. "And it is such a pity, as I am quite\r\nused to going about in cabs."\r\n\r\n"Of course you are," said Lady Glencora. "Why shouldn\'t you? I\'d\r\ngo home in a wheelbarrow if I couldn\'t walk, and had no other\r\nconveyance. That\'s not the question. Mrs. Marsham understands that."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I don\'t understand anything," said that lady.\r\n\r\n"I understand this," said Lady Glencora; "that in all such matters as\r\nthat, I intend to follow my own pleasure. Come, Alice, let us have\r\nsome coffee,"--and she rang the bell. "What a fuss we have made about\r\na stupid old carriage!"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen did not return to the drawing-room that evening,\r\nhaving, no doubt, joint work to do in arranging the great financial\r\ncalculations of the nation; and, at an early hour, Alice was taken\r\nhome in Lady Glencora\'s brougham, leaving her cousin still in the\r\nhands of Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nThe Election for the Chelsea Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch came, and still the Chancellor of the Exchequer held his\r\nposition. In the early days of March there was given in the House a\r\ncertain parliamentary explanation on the subject, which, however, did\r\nnot explain very much to any person. A statement was made which was\r\ndeclared by the persons making it to be altogether satisfactory, but\r\nnobody else seemed to find any satisfaction in it. The big wigs of\r\nthe Cabinet had made an arrangement which, from the language used\r\nby them on this occasion, they must be supposed to have regarded as\r\nhardly less permanent than the stars; but everybody else protested\r\nthat the Government was going to pieces; and Mr. Bott was heard\r\nto declare in clubs and lobbies, and wherever he could get a\r\nsemi-public, political hearing, that this kind of thing wouldn\'t do.\r\nLord Brock must either blow hot or cold. If he chose to lean upon Mr.\r\nPalliser, he might lean upon him, and Mr. Palliser would not be found\r\nwanting. In such case no opposition could touch Lord Brock or the\r\nGovernment. That was Mr. Bott\'s opinion. But if Lord Brock did not so\r\nchoose, why, in that case, he must expect that Mr. Palliser, and Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s friends, would--. Mr. Bott did not say what they would do;\r\nbut he was supposed by those who understood the matter to hint at an\r\nOpposition lobby, and adverse divisions, and to threaten Lord Brock\r\nwith the open enmity of Mr. Palliser,--and of Mr. Palliser\'s great\r\nfollower.\r\n\r\n"This kind of thing won\'t do long, you know," repeated Mr. Bott for\r\nthe second or third time, as he stood upon the rug before the fire at\r\nhis club, with one or two of his young friends around him.\r\n\r\n"I suppose not," said Calder Jones, the hunting Member of Parliament\r\nwhom we once met at Roebury. "Planty Pall won\'t stand it, I should\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"What can he do?" asked another, an unfledged Member who was not as\r\nyet quite settled as to the leadership under which he intended to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"What can he do?" said Mr. Bott, who on such an occasion as this could\r\nbe very great,--who, for a moment, could almost feel that he might\r\nbecome a leader of a party for himself, and some day institute a Bott\r\nMinistry. "What can he do? You will very shortly see what he can do.\r\nHe can make himself the master of the occasion. If Lord Brock doesn\'t\r\nlook about him, he\'ll find that Mr. Palliser will be in the Cabinet\r\nwithout his help."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that the Queen will send for Planty Pall!"\r\nsaid the young Member.\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that the Queen will send for any one that the House\r\nof Commons may direct her to call upon," said Mr. Bott, who conceived\r\nhimself to have gauged the very depths of our glorious Constitution.\r\n"How hard it is to make any one understand that the Queen has really\r\nnothing to do with it!"\r\n\r\n"Come, Bott, draw it mild," said Calder Jones, whose loyalty was\r\nshocked by the utter Manchesterialism of his political friend.\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it," said Mr. Bott, with something of grandeur in his\r\ntone and countenance. "I never drew it mild yet, and I shan\'t begin\r\nnow. All our political offences against civilization have come from\r\nmen drawing it mild, as you call it. Why is it that Englishmen can\'t\r\nread and write as Americans do? Why can\'t they vote as they do even\r\nin Imperial France? Why are they serfs, less free than those whose\r\nchains were broken the other day in Russia? Why is the Spaniard more\r\nhappy, and the Italian more contented? Because men in power have been\r\ndrawing it mild!" And Mr. Bott made an action with his hand as though\r\nhe were drawing up beer from a patent tap.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t set aside Her Majesty like that, you know," said the\r\nyoung Member, who had been presented, and whose mother\'s old-world\r\nnotions about the throne still clung to him.\r\n\r\n"I should be very sorry," said Mr. Bott; "I\'m no republican." With\r\nall his constitutional love, Mr. Bott did not know what the word\r\nrepublican meant. "I mean no disrespect to the throne. The throne in\r\nits place is very well. But the power of governing this great nation\r\ndoes not rest with the throne. It is contained within the four walls\r\nof the House of Commons. That is the great truth which all young\r\nMembers should learn, and take to their hearts."\r\n\r\n"And you think Planty Pall will become Prime Minister?" said Calder\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said that; but there are more unlikely things. Among young\r\nmen I know no man more likely. But I certainly think this,--that if\r\nLord Brock doesn\'t take him into the Cabinet, Lord Brock won\'t long\r\nremain there himself."\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the election came on in the Chelsea districts, and\r\nthe whole of the south-western part of the metropolis was covered\r\nwith posters bearing George Vavasor\'s name. "Vote for Vavasor and the\r\nRiver Bank." That was the cry with which he went to the electors; and\r\nthough it must be presumed that it was understood by some portion of\r\nthe Chelsea electors, it was perfectly unintelligible to the majority\r\nof those who read it. His special acquaintances and his general\r\nenemies called him Viscount Riverbank, and he was pestered on all\r\nsides by questions as to Father Thames. It was Mr. Scruby who invented\r\nthe legend, and who gave George Vavasor an infinity of trouble by the\r\ninvention. There was a question in those days as to embanking the\r\nriver from the Houses of Parliament up to the remote desolations\r\nof further Pimlico, and Mr. Scruby recommended the coming Member\r\nto pledge himself that he would have the work carried on even to\r\nBattersea Bridge. "You must have a subject," pleaded Mr. Scruby. "No\r\nyoung Member can do anything without a subject. And it should be\r\nlocal;--that is to say, if you have anything of a constituency. Such\r\na subject as that, if it\'s well worked, may save you thousands of\r\npounds--thousands of pounds at future elections."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t save me anything at this one, I take it."\r\n\r\n"But it may secure the seat, Mr. Vavasor, and afterwards make you the\r\nmost popular metropolitan Member in the House; that is, with your\r\nown constituency. Only look at the money that would be spent in the\r\ndistricts if that were done! It would come to millions, sir!"\r\n\r\n"But it never will be done."\r\n\r\n"What matters that?" and Mr. Scruby almost became eloquent as he\r\nexplained the nature of a good parliamentary subject. "You should\r\nwork it up, so as to be able to discuss it at all points. Get the\r\nfigures by heart, and then, as nobody else will do so, nobody can put\r\nyou down. Of course it won\'t be done. If it were done, that would be\r\nan end of it, and your bread would be taken out of your mouth. But\r\nyou can always promise it at the hustings, and can always demand\r\nit in the House. I\'ve known men who\'ve walked into as much as two\r\nthousand a year, permanent place, on the strength of a worse subject\r\nthan that!"\r\n\r\nVavasor allowed Mr. Scruby to manage the matter for him, and took\r\nup the subject of the River Bank. "Vavasor and the River Bank"\r\nwas carried about by an army of men with iron shoulder-straps,\r\nand huge pasteboard placards six feet high on the top of them.\r\nYou would think, as you saw the long rows, that the men were\r\nbeing marshalled to their several routes; but they always kept\r\ntogether--four-and-twenty at the heels of each other. "One placard\r\nat a time would strike the eye," said Mr. Vavasor, counting the\r\nexpense up to himself. "There\'s no doubt of it," said Mr. Scruby in\r\nreply. "One placard will do that, if it\'s big enough; but it takes\r\nfour-and-twenty to touch the imagination." And then sides of houses\r\nwere covered with that shibboleth--"Vavasor and the River Bank"--the\r\nsame words repeated in columns down the whole sides of houses.\r\nVavasor himself declared that he was ashamed to walk among his future\r\nconstituents, so conspicuous had his name become. Grimes saw it,\r\nand was dismayed. At first, Grimes ridiculed the cry with all his\r\npublican\'s wit. "Unless he mean to drown hisself in the Reach, it\'s\r\nhard to say what he do mean by all that gammon about the River Bank,"\r\nsaid Grimes, as he canvassed for the other Liberal candidate. But,\r\nafter a while, Grimes was driven to confess that Mr. Scruby knew what\r\nhe was about. "He is a sharp \'un, that he is," said Grimes in the\r\ninside bar of the "Handsome Man;" and he almost regretted that he\r\nhad left the leadership of Mr. Scruby, although he knew that on this\r\noccasion he would not have gotten his odd money.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor, with much labour, actually did get up the subject of\r\nthe River Bank. He got himself introduced to men belonging to the\r\nMetropolitan Board, and went manfully into the matter of pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence. He was able even to work himself into an\r\napparent heat when he was told that the thing was out of the\r\nquestion; and soon found that he had disciples who really believed in\r\nhim. If he could have brought himself to believe in the thing,--if\r\nhe could have been induced himself to care whether Chelsea was to\r\nbe embanked or no, the work would not have been so difficult to him.\r\nIn that case it would have done good to him, if to no one else. But\r\nsuch belief was beyond him. He had gone too far in life to be capable\r\nof believing in, or of caring for, such things. He was ambitious\r\nof having a hand in the government of his country, but he was not\r\ncapable of caring even for that.\r\n\r\nBut he worked. He worked hard, and spoke vehemently, and promised\r\nthe men of Chelsea, Pimlico, and Brompton that the path of London\r\nwestwards had hardly commenced as yet. Sloane Street should be the\r\nnew Cheapside. Squares should arise around the Chelsea barracks, with\r\nsides open to the water, for which Belgravia would be deserted. There\r\nshould be palaces there for the rich, because the rich spend their\r\nriches; but no rich man\'s palace should interfere with the poor man\'s\r\nright to the River Bank. Three millions and a half should be spent\r\non the noble street to be constructed, the grandest pathway that the\r\nworld should ever yet have seen; three millions and a half to be\r\ndrawn from,--to be drawn from anywhere except from Chelsea;--from the\r\nbloated money-bags of the City Corporation, Vavasor once ventured\r\nto declare, amidst the encouraging shouts of the men of Chelsea. Mr.\r\nScruby was forced to own that his pupil worked the subject well.\r\n"Upon my word, that was uncommon good," he said, almost patting\r\nVavasor on the back, after a speech in which he had vehemently\r\nasserted that his ambition to represent the Chelsea districts had all\r\ncome of his long-fixed idea that the glory of future London would be\r\nbrought about by the embankment of the river at Chelsea.\r\n\r\nBut armies of men carrying big boards, and public-houses open at\r\nevery corner, and placards in which the letters are three feet long,\r\ncost money. Those few modest hundreds which Mr. Scruby had already\r\nreceived before the work began, had been paid on the supposition that\r\nthe election would not take place till September. Mr. Scruby made an\r\nearly request, a very early request, that a further sum of fifteen\r\nhundred pounds should be placed in his hands; and he did this in\r\na tone which clearly signified that not a man would be sent about\r\nthrough the streets, or a poster put upon a wall, till this request\r\nhad been conceded. Mr. Scruby was in possession of two very distinct\r\nmanners of address. In his jovial moods, when he was instigating his\r\nclients to fight their battles well, it might almost be thought that\r\nhe was doing it really for the love of the thing; and some clients,\r\nso thinking, had believed for a few hours that Scruby, in his\r\njolly, passionate eagerness, would pour out his own money like dust,\r\ntrusting implicitly to future days for its return. But such clients\r\nhad soon encountered Mr. Scruby\'s other manner, and had perceived that\r\nthey were mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe thing had come so suddenly upon George Vavasor that there was not\r\ntime for him to carry on his further operations through his sister.\r\nHad he written to Kate,--let him have written in what language he\r\nwould,--she would have first rejoined by a negative, and there would\r\nhave been a correspondence before he had induced her to comply.\r\nHe thought of sending for her by telegram, but even in that there\r\nwould have been too much delay. He resolved, therefore, to make his\r\napplication to Alice himself, and he wrote to her, explaining his\r\ncondition. The election had come upon him quite suddenly, as she\r\nknew, he said. He wanted two thousand pounds instantly, and felt\r\nlittle scruple in asking her for it, as he was aware that the old\r\nSquire would be only too glad to saddle the property with a legacy\r\nto Alice for the repayment of this money, though he would not have\r\nadvanced a shilling himself for the purpose of the election. Then\r\nhe said a word or two as to his prolonged absence from Queen Anne\r\nStreet. He had not been there because he had felt, from her manner\r\nwhen they last met, that she would for a while prefer to be left free\r\nfrom the unavoidable excitement of such interviews. But should he be\r\ntriumphant in his present contest, he should go to her to share his\r\ntriumph with her; or, should he fail, he should go to her to console\r\nhim in his failure.\r\n\r\nWithin three days he heard from her, saying that the money would\r\nbe at once placed to his credit. She sent him also her candid good\r\nwishes for success in his enterprise, but beyond this her letter\r\nsaid nothing. There was no word of love,--no word of welcome,--no\r\nexpression of a desire to see him. Vavasor, as he perceived all this\r\nin the reading of her note, felt a triumph in the possession of her\r\nmoney. She was ill-using him by her coldness, and there was comfort\r\nin revenge. "It serves her right," he said to himself. "She should\r\nhave married me at once when she said she would do so, and then it\r\nwould have been my own."\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Tombe had communicated with John Grey on the matter of this\r\nincreased demand,--this demand which Mr. Tombe began to regard as\r\ncarrying a love-affair rather too far,--Grey had telegraphed back\r\nthat Vavasor\'s demand for money, if made through Mr. John Vavasor, was\r\nto be honoured to the extent of five thousand pounds. Mr. Tombe raised\r\nhis eyebrows, and reflected that some men were very foolish. But John\r\nGrey\'s money matters were of such a nature as to make Mr. Tombe know\r\nthat he must do as he was bidden; and the money was paid to George\r\nVavasor\'s account.\r\n\r\nHe told Kate nothing of this. Why should he trouble himself to do so?\r\nIndeed, at this time he wrote no letters to his sister, though she\r\ntwice sent to him, knowing what his exigencies would be, and made\r\nfurther tenders of her own money. He could not reply to these offers\r\nwithout telling her that money had been forthcoming from that other\r\nquarter, and so he left them unanswered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the battle went on gloriously. Mr. Travers, the other\r\nLiberal candidate, spent his money freely,--or else some other person\r\ndid so on his behalf. When Mr. Scruby mentioned this last alternative\r\nto George Vavasor, George cursed his own luck in that he had never\r\nfound such backers. "I don\'t call a man half a Member when he\'s\r\nbrought in like that," said Mr. Scruby, comforting him. "He can\'t do\r\nwhat he likes with his vote. He ain\'t independent. You never hear of\r\nthose fellows getting anything good. Pay for the article yourself, Mr.\r\nVavasor, and then it\'s your own. That\'s what I always say."\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes went to work strenuously, almost fiercely, in the opposite\r\ninterest, telling all that he knew, and perhaps more than he knew, of\r\nVavasor\'s circumstances. He was at work morning, noon, and night, not\r\nonly in his own neighbourhood, but among those men on the river bank\r\nof whom he had spoken so much in his interview with Vavasor in Cecil\r\nStreet. The entire Vavasorian army with its placards was entirely\r\nupset on more than one occasion, and was once absolutely driven\r\nignominiously into the river mud. And all this was done under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Grimes. Vavasor himself was pelted with offal from\r\nthe sinking tide, so that the very name of the River Bank became\r\nodious to him. He was a man who did not like to have his person\r\ntouched, and when they hustled him he became angry. "Lord love you,\r\nMr. Vavasor," said Scruby, "that\'s nothing! I\'ve had a candidate so\r\nmauled,--it was in the Hamlets, I think,--that there wasn\'t a spot\r\non him that wasn\'t painted with rotten eggs. The smell was something\r\nquite awful. But I brought him in, through it all."\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Scruby at last did as much for George Vavasor as he had done\r\nfor the hero of the Hamlets. At the close of the poll Vavasor\'s name\r\nstood at the head by a considerable majority, and Scruby comforted\r\nhim by saying that Travers certainly wouldn\'t stand the expense of a\r\npetition, as the seat was to be held only for a few months.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve done it very cheap, Mr. Vavasor," said Scruby,\r\n"considering that the seat is metropolitan. I do say that you have\r\ndone it cheap. Another thousand, or twelve hundred, will cover\r\neverything--say thirteen, perhaps, at the outside. And when you shall\r\nhave fought the battle once again, you\'ll have paid your footing, and\r\nthe fellows will let you in almost for nothing after that."\r\n\r\nA further sum of thirteen hundred pounds was wanted at once, and then\r\nthe whole thing was to be repeated over again in six months\' time!\r\nThis was not consolatory. But, nevertheless, there was a triumph in\r\nthe thing itself which George Vavasor was man enough to enjoy. It\r\nwould be something to have sat in the House of Commons, though it\r\nshould only have been for half a session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor Takes His Seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor\'s feeling of triumph was not unjustifiable. It is\r\nsomething to have sat in the House of Commons, though it has been but\r\nfor one session! There is on the left-hand side of our great national\r\nhall,--on the left-hand side as one enters it, and opposite to the\r\ndoors leading to the Law Courts,--a pair of gilded lamps, with a door\r\nbetween them, near to which a privileged old dame sells her apples\r\nand her oranges solely, as I presume, for the accommodation of the\r\nMembers of the House and of the great policeman who guards the pass.\r\nBetween those lamps is the entrance to the House of Commons, and none\r\nbut Members may go that way! It is the only gate before which I have\r\never stood filled with envy,--sorrowing to think that my steps might\r\nnever pass under it. There are many portals forbidden to me, as there\r\nare many forbidden to all men; and forbidden fruit, they say, is\r\nsweet; but my lips have watered after no other fruit but that which\r\ngrows so high, within the sweep of that great policeman\'s truncheon.\r\n\r\nAh, my male friend and reader, who earnest thy bread, perhaps, as a\r\ncountry vicar; or sittest, may-be, at some weary desk in Somerset\r\nHouse; or who, perhaps, rulest the yard behind the Cheapside counter,\r\nhast thou never stood there and longed,--hast thou never confessed,\r\nwhen standing there, that Fate has been unkind to thee in denying\r\nthee the one thing that thou hast wanted? I have done so; and as my\r\nslow steps have led me up that more than royal staircase, to those\r\npassages and halls which require the hallowing breath of centuries to\r\ngive them the glory in British eyes which they shall one day possess,\r\nI have told myself, in anger and in grief, that to die and not to\r\nhave won that right of way, though but for a session,--not to have\r\npassed by the narrow entrance through those lamps,--is to die and\r\nnot to have done that which it most becomes an Englishman to have\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nThere are, doubtless, some who come out by that road, the loss of\r\nwhose society is not to be regretted. England does not choose her six\r\nhundred and fifty-four best men. One comforts one\'s self, sometimes,\r\nwith remembering that. The George Vavasors, the Calder Joneses, and\r\nthe Botts are admitted. Dishonesty, ignorance, and vulgarity do\r\nnot close the gate of that heaven against aspirants; and it is a\r\nconsolation to the ambition of the poor to know that the ambition of\r\nthe rich can attain that glory by the strength of its riches alone.\r\nBut though England does not send thither none but her best men, the\r\nbest of her Commoners do find their way there. It is the highest\r\nand most legitimate pride of an Englishman to have the letters\r\nM.P. written after his name. No selection from the alphabet, no\r\ndoctorship, no fellowship, be it of ever so learned or royal a\r\nsociety, no knightship,--not though it be of the Garter,--confers so\r\nfair an honour. Mr. Bott was right when he declared that this country\r\nis governed from between the walls of that House, though the truth\r\nwas almost defiled by the lips which uttered it. He might have added\r\nthat from thence flow the waters of the world\'s progress,--the\r\nfullest fountain of advancing civilization.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor, as he went in by the lamps and the apple-stall, under\r\nthe guardianship of Mr. Bott, felt all the pride of which I have been\r\nspeaking. He was a man quite capable of feeling such pride as it\r\nshould be felt,--capable, in certain dreamy moments, of looking at\r\nthe thing with pure and almost noble eyes; of understanding the\r\nambition of serving with truth so great a nation as that which fate\r\nhad made his own. Nature, I think, had so fashioned George Vavasor,\r\nthat he might have been a good, and perhaps a great man; whereas Mr.\r\nBott had been born small. Vavasor had educated himself to badness\r\nwith his eyes open. He had known what was wrong, and had done it,\r\nhaving taught himself to think that bad things were best. But poor\r\nMr. Bott had meant to do well, and thought that he had done very well\r\nindeed. He was a tuft-hunter and a toady, but he did not know that he\r\nwas doing amiss in seeking to rise by tuft-hunting and toadying. He\r\nwas both mean and vain, both a bully and a coward, and in politics,\r\nI fear, quite unscrupulous in spite of his grand dogmas; but he\r\nbelieved that he was progressing in public life by the proper and\r\nusual means, and was troubled by no idea that he did wrong.\r\n\r\nVavasor, in those dreamy moments of which I have spoken, would\r\nsometimes feel tempted to cut his throat and put an end to himself,\r\nbecause he knew that he had taught himself amiss. Again he would\r\nsadly ask himself whether it was yet too late; always, however,\r\nanswering himself that it was too late. Even now, at this moment,\r\nas he went in between the lamps, and felt much of the honest pride\r\nof which I have spoken, he told himself that it was too late. What\r\ncould he do now, hampered by such a debt as that which he owed to his\r\ncousin, and with the knowledge that it must be almost indefinitely\r\nincreased, unless he meant to give up this seat in Parliament, which\r\nhad cost him so dearly, almost before he had begun to enjoy it? But\r\nhis courage was good, and he was able to resolve that he would go on\r\nwith the business that he had in hand, and play out his game to the\r\nend. He had achieved his seat in the House of Commons, and was so\r\nfar successful. Men who had ever been gracious to him were now more\r\ngracious than ever, and they who had not hitherto treated him with\r\ncourtesy, now began to smile and to be very civil. It was, no doubt,\r\na great thing to have the privilege of that entrance between the\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nMr. Bott had the new Member now in hand, not because there had been\r\nany old friendship between them, but Mr. Bott was on the look-out for\r\nfollowers, and Vavasor was on the look-out for a party. A man gets\r\nno great thanks for attaching himself to existing power. Our friend\r\nmight have enrolled himself among the general supporters of the\r\nGovernment without attracting much attention. He would in such case\r\nhave been at the bottom of a long list. But Mr. Palliser was a rising\r\nman, round whom, almost without wish of his own, a party was forming\r\nitself. If he came into power,--as come he must, according to Mr. Bott\r\nand many others,--then they who had acknowledged the new light before\r\nits brightness had been declared, might expect their reward.\r\n\r\nVavasor, as he passed through the lobby to the door of the House,\r\nleaning on Mr. Bott\'s arm, was very silent. He had spoken but little\r\nsince they had left their cab in Palace Yard, and was not very well\r\npleased by the garrulity of his companion. He was going to sit among\r\nthe first men of his nation, and to take his chance of making himself\r\none of them. He believed in his own ability; he believed thoroughly\r\nin his own courage; but he did not believe in his own conduct. He\r\nfeared that he had done,--feared still more strongly that he would\r\nbe driven to do,--that which would shut men\'s ears against his words,\r\nand would banish him from high places. No man believes in himself who\r\nknows himself to be a rascal, however great may be his talent, or\r\nhowever high his pluck.\r\n\r\n"Of course you have heard a debate?" said Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Vavasor, who wished to remain silent.\r\n\r\n"Many, probably?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"But you have heard debates from the gallery. Now you\'ll hear them\r\nfrom the body of the House, and you\'ll find how very different it is.\r\nThere\'s no man can know what Parliament is who has never had a seat.\r\nIndeed no one can thoroughly understand the British Constitution\r\nwithout it. I felt, very early in life, that that should be my line;\r\nand though it\'s hard work and no pay, I mean to stick to it. How\r\ndo, Thompson? You know Vavasor? He\'s just returned for the Chelsea\r\nDistricts, and I\'m taking him up. We shan\'t divide to-night; shall\r\nwe? Look! there\'s Farringcourt just coming out; he\'s listened to\r\nbetter than any man in the House now, but he\'ll borrow half-a-crown\r\nfrom you if you\'ll lend him one. How d\'ye do, my lord? I hope I have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing you well?" and Bott bowed low to a lord who\r\nwas hurrying through the lobby as fast as his shuffling feet would\r\ncarry him. "Of course you know him?"\r\n\r\nVavasor, however, did not know the lord in question, and was obliged\r\nto say so.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were up to all these things?" said Bott.\r\n\r\n"Taking the peerage generally, I am not up to it," said Vavasor, with\r\na curl on his lip.\r\n\r\n"But you ought to have known him. That was Viscount Middlesex; he has\r\ngot something on to-night about the Irish Church. His father is past\r\nninety, and he\'s over sixty. We\'ll go in now; but let me give you one\r\nbit of advice, my dear fellow--don\'t think of speaking this session.\r\nA Member can do no good at that work till he has learned something of\r\nthe forms of the House. The forms of the House are everything; upon\r\nmy word they are. This is Mr. Vavasor, the new Member for the Chelsea\r\nDistricts."\r\n\r\nOur friend was thus introduced to the doorkeeper, who smiled\r\nfamiliarly, and seemed to wink his eye. Then George Vavasor passed\r\nthrough into the House itself, under the wing of Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\nVavasor, as he walked up the House to the Clerk\'s table and took the\r\noath and then walked down again, felt himself to be almost taken\r\naback by the little notice which was accorded to him. It was not that\r\nhe had expected to create a sensation, or that he had for a moment\r\nthought on the subject, but the thing which he was doing was so\r\ngreat to him, that the total indifference of those around him was\r\na surprise to him. After he had taken his seat, a few men came up\r\nby degrees and shook hands with him; but it seemed, as they did so,\r\nmerely because they were passing that way. He was anxious not to\r\nsit next to Mr. Bott, but he found himself unable to avoid this\r\ncontiguity. That gentleman stuck to him pertinaciously, giving him\r\ndirections which, at the spur of the moment, he hardly knew how not\r\nto obey. So he found himself sitting behind Mr. Palliser, a little to\r\nthe right, while Mr. Bott occupied the ear of the rising man.\r\n\r\nThere was a debate in progress, but it seemed to Vavasor, as soon\r\nas he was able to become critical, to be but a dull affair, and yet\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his legs, and Mr. Palliser\r\nwas watching him as a cat watches a mouse. The speaker was full of\r\nfigures, as becomes a Chancellor of the Exchequer; and as every new\r\nbudget of them fell from him, Mr. Bott, with audible whispers, poured\r\ninto the ear of his chief certain calculations of his own, most of\r\nwhich went to prove that the financier in office was altogether\r\nwrong. Vavasor thought that he could see that Mr. Palliser was\r\nreceiving more of his assistance than was palatable to him. He would\r\nlisten, if he did listen, without making any sign that he heard, and\r\nwould occasionally shake his head with symptoms of impatience. But\r\nMr. Bott was a man not to be repressed by a trifle. When Mr. Palliser\r\nshook his head he became more assiduous than ever, and when Mr.\r\nPalliser slightly moved himself to the left, he boldly followed him.\r\n\r\nNo general debate arose on the subject which the Minister had in\r\nhand, and when he sat down, Mr. Palliser would not get up, though\r\nMr. Bott counselled him to do so. The matter was over for the night,\r\nand the time had arrived for Lord Middlesex. That nobleman got upon\r\nhis feet, with a roll of papers in his hand, and was proceeding to\r\naddress the House on certain matters of church reform, with great\r\nenergy; but, alas, for him and for his feelings! before his energy\r\nhad got itself into full swing, the Members were swarming away\r\nthrough the doors like a flock of sheep. Mr. Palliser got up and went,\r\nand was followed at once by Mr. Bott, who succeeded in getting hold\r\nof his arm in the lobby. Had not Mr. Palliser been an even-tempered,\r\ncalculating man, with a mind and spirit well under his command, he\r\nmust have learned to hate Mr. Bott before this time. Away streamed the\r\nMembers, but still the noble lord went on speaking, struggling hard\r\nto keep up his fire as though no such exodus were in process. There\r\nwas but little to console him. He knew that the papers would not\r\nreport one sentence in twenty of those he uttered. He knew that no\r\none would listen to him willingly. He knew that he had worked for\r\nweeks and months to get up his facts, and he was beginning to know\r\nthat he had worked in vain. As he summoned courage to look round, he\r\nbegan to fear that some enemy would count the House, and that all\r\nwould be over. He had given heart and soul to this affair. His cry\r\nwas not as Vavasor\'s cry about the River Bank. He believed in his own\r\nsubject with a great faith, thinking that he could make men happier\r\nand better, and bring them nearer to their God. I said that he had\r\nworked for weeks and months. I might have said that he had been all\r\nhis life at this work. Though he shuffled with his feet when he\r\nwalked, and knocked his words together when he talked, he was an\r\nearnest man, meaning to do well, seeking no other reward for his\r\nwork than the appreciation of those whom he desired to serve. But\r\nthis was never to be his. For him there was in store nothing but\r\ndisappointment. And yet he will work on to the end, either in this\r\nHouse or in the other, labouring wearily, without visible wages of\r\nany kind, and, one may say, very sadly. But when he has been taken to\r\nhis long rest, men will acknowledge that he has done something, and\r\nthere will be left on the minds of those who shall remember him a\r\nconviction that he served a good cause diligently, and not altogether\r\ninefficiently. Invisible are his wages, yet in some coin are they\r\npaid. Invisible is the thing he does, and yet it is done. Let us hope\r\nthat some sense of this tardy appreciation may soothe his spirit\r\nbeyond the grave. On the present occasion there was nothing to soothe\r\nhis spirit. The Speaker sat, urbane and courteous, with his eyes\r\nturned towards the unfortunate orator; but no other ears in the House\r\nseemed to listen to him. The corps of reporters had dwindled down to\r\ntwo, and they used their pens very listlessly, taking down here a\r\nsentence and there a sentence, knowing that their work was naught.\r\nVavasor sat it out to the last, as it taught him a lesson in those\r\nforms of the House which Mr. Bott had truly told him it would be\r\nwell that he should learn. And at last he did learn the form of a\r\n"count-out." Some one from a back seat muttered something, which the\r\nSpeaker understood; and that high officer, having had his attention\r\ncalled to a fact of which he would never have taken cognizance\r\nwithout such calling, did count the House, and finding that it\r\ncontained but twenty-three Members, he put an end to his own labours\r\nand to those of poor Lord Middlesex. With what feelings that noble\r\nlord must have taken himself home, and sat himself down in his study,\r\nvainly opening a book before his eyes, can we not all imagine? A man\r\nhe was with ample means, with children who would do honour to his\r\nname; one whose wife believed in him, if no one else would do so; a\r\nman, let us say, with a clear conscience, to whom all good things had\r\nbeen given. But of whom now was he thinking with envy? Early on that\r\nsame day Farringcourt had spoken in the House,--a man to whom no one\r\nwould lend a shilling, whom the privilege of that House kept out of\r\ngaol, whose word no man believed; who was wifeless, childless, and\r\nunloved. But three hundred men had hung listening upon his words.\r\nWhen he laughed in his speech, they laughed; when he was indignant\r\nagainst the Minister, they sat breathless, as the Spaniard sits in\r\nthe critical moment of the bull-killing. Whichever way he turned\r\nhimself, he carried them with him. Crowds of Members flocked into the\r\nHouse from libraries and smoking-rooms when it was known that this\r\nne\'er-do-well was on his legs. The Strangers\' Gallery was filled to\r\noverflowing. The reporters turned their rapid pages, working their\r\nfingers wearily till the sweat drops stood upon their brows. And\r\nas the Premier was attacked with some special impetus of redoubled\r\nirony, men declared that he would be driven to enrol the speaker\r\namong his colleagues, in spite of dishonoured bills and evil reports.\r\nA man who could shake the thunderbolts like that must be paid to\r\nshake them on the right side. It was of this man, and of his success,\r\nthat Lord Middlesex was envious, as he sat, wretched and respectable,\r\nin his solitary study!\r\n\r\nMr. Bott had left the House with Mr. Palliser; and Vavasor, after\r\nthe count-out, was able to walk home by himself, and think of the\r\nposition which he had achieved. He told himself over and over again\r\nthat he had done a great thing in obtaining that which he now\r\npossessed, and he endeavoured to teach himself that the price he\r\nwas paying for it was not too dear. But already there had come upon\r\nhim something of that feeling,--that terribly human feeling,--which\r\ndeprives every prize that is gained of half its value. The mere\r\nhaving it robs the diamond of its purity, and mixes vile alloy with\r\nthe gold. Lord Middlesex, as he had floundered on into terrible\r\ndisaster, had not been a subject to envy. There had been nothing of\r\nbrilliance in the debate, and the Members had loomed no larger than\r\nordinary men at ordinary clubs. The very doorkeepers had hardly\r\ntreated them with respect. The great men with whose names the papers\r\nare filled had sat silent, gloomy, and apparently idle. As soon as\r\na fair opportunity was given them they escaped out of the House, as\r\nboys might escape from school. Everybody had rejoiced in the break-up\r\nof the evening, except that one poor old lord who had worked so hard.\r\nVavasor had spent everything that he had to become a Member of that\r\nHouse, and now, as he went alone to his lodgings, he could not but\r\nask himself whether the thing purchased was worth the purchase-money.\r\n\r\nBut his courage was still high. Though he was gloomy, and almost sad,\r\nhe knew that he could trust himself to fight out the battle to the\r\nlast. On the morrow he would go to Queen Anne Street, and would\r\ndemand sympathy there from her who had professed to sympathize with\r\nhim so strongly in his political desires. With her, at any rate, the\r\nglory of his Membership would not be dimmed by any untoward knowledge\r\nof the realities. She had only seen the play acted from the boxes;\r\nand to her eyes the dresses would still be of silk velvet, and the\r\nswords of bright steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nA Love Gift.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alice heard of her cousin\'s success, and understood that he was\r\nactually Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts, she resolved\r\nthat she would be triumphant. She had sacrificed nearly everything\r\nto her desire for his success in public life, and now that he had\r\nachieved the first great step towards that success, it would have\r\nbeen madness on her part to decline her share in the ovation. If\r\nshe could not rejoice in that, what source of joy would then be left\r\nfor her? She had promised to be his wife, and at present she was\r\nunder the bonds of that promise. She had so promised because she\r\nhad desired to identify her interests with his,--because she wished\r\nto share his risks, to assist his struggles, and to aid him in his\r\npublic career. She had done all this, and he had been successful. She\r\nstrove, therefore, to be triumphant on his behalf, but she knew that\r\nshe was striving ineffectually. She had made a mistake, and the days\r\nwere coming in which she would have to own to herself that she had\r\ndone so in sackcloth, and to repent with ashes.\r\n\r\nBut yet she struggled to be triumphant. The tidings were first\r\nbrought to her by her servant, and then she at once sat down to\r\nwrite him a word or two of congratulation. But she found the task\r\nmore difficult than she had expected, and she gave it up. She had\r\nwritten no word to him since the day on which he had left her almost\r\nin anger, and now she did not know how she was to address him. "I\r\nwill wait till he comes," she said, putting away from her the paper\r\nand pens. "It will be easier to speak than to write." But she wrote\r\nto Kate, and contrived to put some note of triumph into her letter.\r\nKate had written to her at length, filling her sheet with a loud paean\r\nof sincere rejoicing. To Kate, down in Westmoreland, it had seemed\r\nthat her brother had already done everything. He had already tied\r\nFortune to his chariot wheels. He had made the great leap, and had\r\novercome the only obstacle that Fate had placed in his way. In her\r\ngreat joy she almost forgot whence had come the money with which the\r\ncontest had been won. She was not enthusiastic in many things;--about\r\nherself she was never so; but now she was elated with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich seemed to know no bounds. "I am proud," she said, in her letter\r\nto Alice. "No other thing that he could have done would have made me\r\nso proud of him. Had the Queen sent for him and made him an earl, it\r\nwould have been as nothing to this. When I think that he has forced\r\nhis way into Parliament without any great friend, with nothing to\r\nback him but his own wit"--she had, in truth, forgotten Alice\'s money\r\nas she wrote;--"that he has achieved his triumph in the metropolis,\r\namong the most wealthy and most fastidious of the richest city in the\r\nworld, I do feel proud of my brother. And, Alice, I hope that you are\r\nproud of your lover." Poor girl! One cannot but like her pride, nay,\r\nalmost love her for it, though it was so sorely misplaced. It must be\r\nremembered that she had known nothing of Messrs. Grimes and Scruby,\r\nand the River Bank, and that the means had been wanting to her of\r\nlearning the principles upon which some metropolitan elections are\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n"And, Alice, I hope that you are proud of your lover!" "He is not\r\nmy lover," Alice said to herself. "He knows that he is not. He\r\nunderstands it, though she may not." And if not your lover, Alice\r\nVavasor, what is he then to you? And what are you to him, if not his\r\nlove? She was beginning to understand that she had put herself in\r\nthe way of utter destruction;--that she had walked to the brink of\r\na precipice, and that she must now topple over it. "He is not my\r\nlover," she said; and then she sat silent and moody, and it took her\r\nhours to get her answer written to Kate.\r\n\r\nOn the same afternoon she saw her father for a moment or two. "So\r\nGeorge has got himself returned," he said, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has been successful. I\'m sure you must be glad, papa."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I\'m not. He has bought a seat for three months; and\r\nwith whose money has he purchased it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let us always speak of money, papa."\r\n\r\n"When you discuss the value of a thing just purchased, you must\r\nmention the price before you know whether the purchaser has done well\r\nor badly. They have let him in for his money because there are only a\r\nfew months left before the general election. Two thousand pounds he\r\nhas had, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"And if as much more is wanted for the next election he shall have\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear;--very well, If you choose to make a beggar of\r\nyourself, I cannot help it. Indeed, I shall not complain though he\r\nshould spend all your money, if you do not marry him at last." In\r\nanswer to this, Alice said nothing. On that point her father\'s wishes\r\nwere fast growing to be identical with her own.\r\n\r\n"I tell you fairly what are my feelings and my wishes," he continued.\r\n"Nothing, in my opinion, would be so deplorable and ruinous as such\r\na marriage. You tell me that you have made up your mind to take him,\r\nand I know well that nothing that I can say will turn you. But I\r\nbelieve that when he has spent all your money he will not take you,\r\nand that thus you will be saved. Thinking as I do about him, you can\r\nhardly expect that I should triumph because he has got himself into\r\nParliament with your money!"\r\n\r\nThen he left her, and it seemed to Alice that he had been very cruel.\r\nThere had been little, she thought, nay, nothing of a father\'s loving\r\ntenderness in his words to her. If he had spoken to her differently,\r\nmight she not even now have confessed everything to him? But herein\r\nAlice accused him wrongfully. Tenderness from him on this subject\r\nhad, we may say, become impossible. She had made it impossible. Nor\r\ncould he tell her the extent of his wishes without damaging his own\r\ncause. He could not let her know that all that was done was so done\r\nwith the view of driving her into John Grey\'s arms.\r\n\r\nBut what words were those for a father to speak to a daughter! Had\r\nshe brought herself to such a state that her own father desired to\r\nsee her deserted and thrown aside? And was it probable that this wish\r\nof his should come to pass? As to that, Alice had already made up\r\nher mind. She thought that she had made up her mind that she would\r\nnever become her cousin\'s wife. It needed not her father\'s wish to\r\naccomplish her salvation, if her salvation lay in being separated\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning George went to her. The reader will, perhaps,\r\nremember their last interview. He had come to her after her letter to\r\nhim from Westmoreland, and had asked her to seal their reconciliation\r\nwith a kiss; but she had refused him. He had offered to embrace her,\r\nand she had shuddered before him, fearing his touch, telling him by\r\nsigns much more clear than any words, that she felt for him none of\r\nthe love of a woman. Then he had turned from her in anger, declaring\r\nto her honestly that he was angry. Since that he had borrowed her\r\nmoney,--had made two separate assaults upon her purse,--and was now\r\ncome to tell her of the results. How was he to address her? I beg\r\nthat it may be also remembered that he was not a man to forget the\r\ntreatment he had received. When he entered the room, Alice looked\r\nat him, at first, almost furtively. She was afraid of him. It must\r\nbe confessed that she already feared him. Had there been in the man\r\nanything of lofty principle he might still have made her his slave,\r\nthough I doubt whether he could ever again have forced her to love\r\nhim. She looked at him furtively, and perceived that the gash on his\r\nface was nearly closed. The mark of existing anger was not there. He\r\nhad come to her intending to be gentle, if it might be possible. He\r\nhad been careful in his dress, as though he wished to try once again\r\nif the role of lover might be within his reach.\r\n\r\nAlice was the first to speak. "George, I am so glad that you have\r\nsucceeded! I wish you joy with my whole heart."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, dearest. But before I say another word, let me acknowledge\r\nmy debt. Unless you had aided me with your money, I could not have\r\nsucceeded."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George! pray don\'t speak of that!"\r\n\r\n"Let me rather speak of it at once, and have done. If you will think\r\nof it, you will know that I must speak of it sooner or later." He\r\nsmiled and looked pleasant, as he used to do in those Swiss days.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, speak and have done."\r\n\r\n"I hope you have trusted me in thus giving me the command of your\r\nfortune?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"I do believe that you have. I need hardly say that I could not have\r\nstood for this last election without it; and I must try to make you\r\nunderstand that if I had not come forward at this vacancy, I should\r\nhave stood no chance for the next; otherwise, I should not have been\r\njustified in paying so dearly for a seat for one session. You can\r\nunderstand that; eh, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think so?\r\n\r\n"Anybody, even your father, would tell you that; though, probably,\r\nhe regards my ambition to be a Member of Parliament as a sign of\r\ndownright madness. But I was obliged to stand now, if I intended to\r\ngo on with it, as that old lord died so inopportunely. Well, about\r\nthe money! It is quite upon the cards that I may be forced to ask for\r\nanother loan when the autumn comes."\r\n\r\n"You shall have it, George."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Alice. And now I will tell you what I propose. You know\r\nthat I have been reconciled,--with a sort of reconciliation,--to my\r\ngrandfather? Well, when the next affair is over, I propose to tell\r\nhim exactly how you and I then stand."\r\n\r\n"Do not go into that now, George. It is enough for you at present to\r\nbe assured that such assistance as I can give you is at your command.\r\nI want you to feel the full joy of your success, and you will do so\r\nmore thoroughly if you will banish all these money troubles from your\r\nmind for a while."\r\n\r\n"They shall, at any rate, be banished while I am with you," said he.\r\n"There; let them go!" And he lifted up his right hand, and blew at\r\nthe tips of his fingers. "Let them vanish," said he. "It is always\r\nwell to be rid of such troubles for a time."\r\n\r\nIt is well to be rid of them at any time, or at all times, if only\r\nthey can be banished without danger. But when a man has overused his\r\nliver till it will not act for him any longer, it is not well for him\r\nto resolve that he will forget the weakness of his organ just as he\r\nsits down to dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty bit of acting, that of Vavasor\'s, when he blew away\r\nhis cares; and, upon the whole, I do not know that he could have\r\ndone better. But Alice saw through it, and he knew that she did so.\r\nThe whole thing was uncomfortable to him, except the fact that he\r\nhad the promise of her further moneys. But he did not intend to\r\nrest satisfied with this. He must extract from her some meed of\r\napprobation, some show of sympathy, some spark of affection, true or\r\npretended, in order that he might at least affect to be satisfied,\r\nand be enabled to speak of the future without open embarrassment. How\r\ncould even he take her money from her, unless he might presume that\r\nhe stood with her upon some ground that belonged mutually to them\r\nboth?\r\n\r\n"I have already taken my seat," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I saw that in the newspapers. My acquaintance among Members of\r\nParliament is very small, but I see that you were introduced, as they\r\ncall it, by one of the few men that I do know. Is Mr. Bott a friend of\r\nyours?"\r\n\r\n"No,--certainly not a friend. I may probably have to act with him in\r\npublic."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s just what they said of Mr. Palliser when they felt ashamed\r\nof his having such a man as his guest. I think if I were in public\r\nlife I should try to act with people that I could like."\r\n\r\n"Then you dislike Mr. Bott?"\r\n\r\n"I do not like him, but my feelings about him are not violent."\r\n\r\n"He is a vulgar ass," said George, "with no more pretensions to rank\r\nhimself a gentleman than your footman."\r\n\r\n"If I had one."\r\n\r\n"But he will get on in Parliament, to a certain extent."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t quite understand what are the requisites for\r\nParliamentary success, or indeed of what it consists. Is his\r\nambition, do you suppose, the same as yours?"\r\n\r\n"His ambition, I take it, does not go beyond a desire to be\r\nParliamentary flunkey to a big man,--with wages, if possible, but\r\nwithout, if the wages are impossible."\r\n\r\n"And yours?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to mine;--there are some things, Alice, that a man does not\r\ntell to any one."\r\n\r\n"Are there? They must be very terrible things."\r\n\r\n"The schoolboy, when he sits down to make his rhymes, dares not say,\r\neven to his sister, that he hopes to rival Milton; but he nurses such\r\na hope. The preacher, when he preaches his sermon, does not whisper,\r\neven to his wife, his belief that thousands may perhaps be turned\r\nto repentance by the strength of his words; but he thinks that the\r\nthousand converts are possible."\r\n\r\n"And you, though you will not say so, intend to rival Chatham, and to\r\nmake your thousand converts in politics."\r\n\r\n"I like to hear you laugh at me,--I do, indeed. It does me good to\r\nhear your voice again with some touch of satire in it. It brings back\r\nthe old days,--the days to which I hope we may soon revert without\r\npain. Shall it not be so, dearest?"\r\n\r\nHer playful manner at once deserted her. Why had he made this foolish\r\nattempt to be tender? "I do not know," she said, gloomily.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes he sat silent, fingering some article belonging to\r\nher which was lying on the table. It was a small steel paper-knife,\r\nof which the handle was cast and gilt; a thing of no great value, of\r\nwhich the price may have been five shillings. He sat with it, passing\r\nit through his fingers, while she went on with her work.\r\n\r\n"Who gave you this paper-cutter?" he said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Goodness me, why do you ask? and especially, why do you ask in that\r\nway?"\r\n\r\n"I asked simply because if it is a present to you from any one, I\r\nwill take up something else."\r\n\r\n"It was given me by Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\nHe let it drop from his fingers on to the table with a noise, and\r\nthen pushed it from him, so that it fell on the other side, near to\r\nwhere she sat.\r\n\r\n"George," she said, as she stooped and picked it up, "your violence\r\nis unreasonable; pray do not repeat it."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean it," he said, "and I beg your pardon. I was simply\r\nunfortunate in the article I selected. And who gave you this?" In\r\nsaying which he took up a little ivory foot-rule that was folded up\r\nso as to bring it within the compass of three inches.\r\n\r\n"It so happens that no one gave me that; I bought it at a stupid\r\nbazaar."\r\n\r\n"Then this will do. You shall give it me as a present, on the renewal\r\nof our love."\r\n\r\n"It is too poor a thing to give," said she, speaking still more\r\ngloomily than she had done before.\r\n\r\n"By no means; nothing is too poor, if given in that way. Anything\r\nwill do; a ribbon, a glove, a broken sixpence. Will you give me\r\nsomething that I may take, and, taking it, may know that your heart\r\nis given with it?"\r\n\r\n"Take the rule, if you please," she said.\r\n\r\n"And about the heart?" he asked.\r\n\r\nHe should have been more of a rascal or less. Seeing how very much of\r\na rascal he was already, I think it would have been better that he\r\nshould have been more,--that he should have been able to content his\r\nspirit with the simple acquisition of her money, and that he should\r\nhave been free from all those remains of a finer feeling which made\r\nhim desire her love also. But it was not so. It was necessary for\r\nhis comfort that she should, at any rate, say she loved him. "Well,\r\nAlice, and what about the heart?" he asked again.\r\n\r\n"I would so much rather talk about politics, George," said she.\r\n\r\nThe cicatrice began to make itself very visible in his face, and the\r\ndebonair manner was fast vanishing. He had fixed his eyes upon her,\r\nand had inserted his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"Alice, that is not quite fair," he said.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to be unfair."\r\n\r\n"I am not so sure of that. I almost think that you do mean it. You\r\nhave told me that you intend to become my wife. If, after that, you\r\nwilfully make me miserable, will not that be unfair?"\r\n\r\n"I am not making you miserable,--certainly not wilfully."\r\n\r\n"Did that letter which you wrote to me from Westmoreland mean\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"George, do not strive to make me think that it meant too much."\r\n\r\n"If it did, you had better say so at once."\r\n\r\nBut Alice, though she would have said so had she dared, made no\r\nanswer to this. She sat silent, turning her face away from his gaze,\r\nlonging that the meeting might be over, and feeling that she had lost\r\nher own self-respect.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Alice," he said, "I find it very hard to understand you.\r\nWhen I look back over all that has passed between us, and to that\r\nother episode in your life, summing it all up with your conduct to me\r\nat present, I find myself at a loss to read your character."\r\n\r\n"I fear I cannot help you in the reading of it."\r\n\r\n"When you first loved me;--for you did love me. I understood that\r\nwell enough. There is no young man who in early life does not read\r\nwith sufficient clearness that sweetest morsel of poetry.--And when\r\nyou quarrelled with me, judging somewhat harshly of my offences, I\r\nunderstood that also; for it is the custom of women to be hard in\r\ntheir judgement on such sins. When I heard that you had accepted the\r\noffer made to you by that gentleman in Cambridgeshire, I thought that\r\nI understood you still,--knowing how natural it was that you should\r\nseek some cure for your wound. I understood it, and accused myself,\r\nnot you, in that I had driven you to so fatal a remedy." Here Alice\r\nturned round towards him sharply, as though she were going to\r\ninterrupt him, but she said nothing, though he paused for her to\r\nspeak; and then he went on. "And I understood it well when I heard\r\nthat this cure had been too much for you. By heavens, yes! there was\r\nno misunderstanding that. I meant no insult to the man when I upset\r\nhis little toy just now. I have not a word to say against him. For\r\nmany women he would make a model husband, but you are not one of\r\nthem. And when you discovered this yourself, as you did, I understood\r\nthat without difficulty. Yes, by heavens! if ever woman had been\r\ndriven to a mistake, you had been driven to one there." Here she\r\nlooked at him again, and met his eyes. She looked at him with\r\nsomething of his own fierceness in her face, as though she were\r\npreparing herself to fight with him; but she said nothing at the\r\nmoment, and then he again went on. "And, Alice, I understood it\r\nalso when you again consented to be my wife. I thought that I still\r\nunderstood you then. I may have been vain to think so, but surely it\r\nwas natural. I believed that the old love had come back upon you, and\r\nagain warmed your heart. I thought that it had been cold during our\r\nseparation, and I was pleased to think so. Was that unnatural? Put\r\nyourself in my place, and say if you would not have thought so. I\r\ntold myself that I understood you then, and I told myself that in\r\nall that you had done you had acted as a true, and good, and loving\r\nwoman. I thought of you much, and I saw that your conduct, as a\r\nwhole, was intelligible and becoming." The last word grated on\r\nAlice\'s ears, and she showed her anger by the motion of her foot upon\r\nthe floor. Her cousin noted it all, but went on as though he had\r\nnot noted it. "But now your present behaviour makes all the rest a\r\nriddle. You have said that you would be my wife, declaring thereby\r\nthat you had forgiven my offences, and, as I suppose, reassuring me\r\nof your love; and yet you receive me with all imaginable coldness.\r\nWhat am I to think of it, and in what way would you have me behave to\r\nyou? When last I was here I asked you for a kiss." As he said this he\r\nlooked at her with all his eyes, with his mouth just open, so as to\r\nshow the edges of his white teeth, with the wound down his face all\r\nwide and purple. The last word came with a stigmatizing hiss from\r\nhis lips. Though she did not essay to speak, he paused again, as if\r\nhe were desirous that she might realize the full purport of such a\r\nrequest. I think that, in the energy of his speaking, a touch of true\r\npassion had come upon him; that he had forgotten his rascaldom, and\r\nhis need of her money, and that he was punishing her with his whole\r\npower of his vengeance for the treatment which he had received from\r\nher. "I asked you for a kiss. If you are to be my wife you can have\r\nno shame in granting me such a request. Within the last two months\r\nyou have told me that you would marry me. What am I to think of such\r\na promise if you deny me all customary signs of your affection?" Then\r\nhe paused again, and she found that the time had come in which she\r\nmust say something to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I asked you for a kiss."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I wonder you cannot understand," she said, "that I have suffered\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"And is that to be my answer?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what answer you want."\r\n\r\n"Come, Alice, do not be untrue; you do know what answer I want, and\r\nyou know also whether my wanting it is unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"No one ever told me that I was untrue before," she said.\r\n\r\n"You do know what it is that I desire. I desire to learn that the\r\nwoman who is to be my wife, in truth, loves me."\r\n\r\nShe was standing up, and so was he also, but still she said nothing.\r\nHe had in his hand the little rule which she had told him that he\r\nmight take, but he held it as though in doubt what he would do with\r\nit. "Well, Alice, am I to hear anything from you?"\r\n\r\n"Not now, George; you are angry, and I will not speak to you in your\r\nanger."\r\n\r\n"Have I not cause to be angry? Do you not know that you are treating\r\nme badly?"\r\n\r\n"I know that my head aches, and that I am very wretched. I wish you\r\nwould leave me."\r\n\r\n"There, then, is your gift," said he, and he threw the rule over on\r\nto the sofa behind her. "And there is the trumpery trinket which I\r\nhad hoped you would have worn for my sake." Whereupon something which\r\nhe had taken from his waistcoat-pocket was thrown violently into the\r\nfender, beneath the fire-grate. He then walked with quick steps to\r\nthe door; but when his hand was on the handle, he turned. "Alice," he\r\nsaid, "when I am gone, try to think honestly of your conduct to me."\r\nThen he went, and she remained still, till she heard the front door\r\nclose behind him.\r\n\r\nWhen she was sure that he was gone, her first movement was made in\r\nsearch of the trinket. I fear that this was not dignified on her\r\npart; but I think that it was natural. It was not that she had any\r\ndesire for the jewel, or any curiosity even to see it. She would very\r\nmuch have preferred that he should have brought nothing of the kind\r\nto her. But she had a feminine reluctance that anything of value\r\nshould be destroyed without a purpose. So she took the shovel, and\r\npoked among the ashes, and found the ring which her cousin had thrown\r\nthere. It was a valuable ring, bearing a ruby on it between two small\r\ndiamonds. Such at least, she became aware, had been its bearing; but\r\none of the side stones had been knocked out by the violence with\r\nwhich the ring had been flung. She searched even for this, scorching\r\nher face and eyes, but in vain. Then she made up her mind that the\r\ndiamond should be lost for ever, and that it should go out among\r\nthe cinders into the huge dust-heaps of the metropolis. Better that,\r\nthough it was distasteful to her feminine economy, than the other\r\nalternative of setting the servants to search, and thereby telling\r\nthem something of what had been done.\r\n\r\nWhen her search was over, she placed the ring on the mantelpiece; but\r\nshe knew that it would not do to leave it there,--so she folded it up\r\ncarefully in a new sheet of note-paper, and put it in the drawer of\r\nher desk. After that she sat herself down at the table to think what\r\nshe would do; but her head was, in truth, racked with pain, and on\r\nthat occasion she could bring her thoughts to no conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre\'s Disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Greenow was left alone in her lodgings, after the little\r\nentertainment which she had given to her two lovers, she sat herself\r\ndown to think seriously over her affairs. There were three paths open\r\nbefore her. She might take Mr. Cheesacre, or she might take Captain\r\nBellfield--or she might decide that she would have nothing more\r\nto say to either of them in the way of courting. They were very\r\npersistent, no doubt; but she thought that she would know how to make\r\nthem understand her, if she should really make up her mind that she\r\nwould have neither one nor the other. She was going to leave Norwich\r\nafter Easter, and they knew that such was her purpose. Something had\r\nbeen said of her returning to Yarmouth in the summer. She was a just\r\nwoman at heart, and justice required that each of them should know\r\nwhat was to be his prospect if she did so return.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal to be said on Mr. Cheesacre\'s behalf.\r\nMahogany-furnitured bedrooms assist one\'s comfort in this life;\r\nand heaps of manure, though they are not brilliant in romance, are\r\nvery efficacious in farming. Mrs. Greenow by no means despised these\r\nthings; and as for the owner of them, though she saw that there was\r\nmuch amiss in his character, she thought that his little foibles were\r\nof such a nature that she, as his wife, or any other woman of spirit,\r\nmight be able to repress them, if not to cure them. But she had\r\nalready married for money once, as she told herself very plainly on\r\nthis occasion, and she thought that she might now venture on a little\r\nlove. Her marriage for money had been altogether successful. The\r\nnursing of old Greenow had not been very disagreeable to her, nor had\r\nit taken longer than she had anticipated. She had now got all the\r\nreward that she had ever promised herself, and she really did feel\r\ngrateful to his memory. I almost think that among those plentiful\r\ntears some few drops belonged to sincerity. She was essentially a\r\nhappy-tempered woman, blessed with a good digestion, who looked back\r\nupon her past life with contentment, and forward to her future life\r\nwith confidence. She would not be greedy, she said to herself. She\r\ndid not want more money, and therefore she would have none of Mr.\r\nCheesacre. So far she resolved,--resolving also that, if possible,\r\nthe mahogany-furnitured bedrooms should be kept in the family, and\r\nmade over to her niece, Kate Vavasor.\r\n\r\nBut should she marry for love; and if so, should Captain Bellfield\r\nbe the man? Strange to say, his poverty and his scampishness and his\r\nlies almost recommended him to her. At any rate, it was not of those\r\nthings that she was afraid. She had a woman\'s true belief in her own\r\npower, and thought that she could cure them,--as far as they needed\r\ncure. As for his stories about Inkerman, and his little debts, she\r\ncared nothing about that. She also had her Inkermans, and was quite\r\naware that she made as good use of them as the Captain did of his.\r\nAnd as for the debts,--what was a man to do who hadn\'t got any money?\r\nShe also had owed for her gloves and corsets in the ante-Greenow days\r\nof her adventures. But there was this danger,--that there might be\r\nmore behind of which she had never heard. Another Mrs. Bellfield\r\nwas not impossible; and what, if instead of being a real captain\r\nat all, he should be a returned ticket-of-leave man! Such things\r\nhad happened. Her chief security was in this,--that Cheesacre had\r\nknown the man for many years, and would certainly have told anything\r\nagainst him that he did know. Under all these circumstances, she\r\ncould not quite make up her mind either for or against Captain\r\nBellfield.\r\n\r\nBetween nine and ten in the evening, an hour or so after Mr. Cheesacre\r\nhad left her, Jeannette brought to her some arrowroot with a little\r\nsherry in it. She usually dined early, and it was her habit to take a\r\nlight repast before she retired for the night.\r\n\r\n"Jeannette," she said, as she stirred the lumps of white sugar in the\r\nbowl, "I\'m afraid those two gentlemen have quarrelled."\r\n\r\n"Oh, laws, ma\'am, in course they have! How was they to help it?"\r\n\r\nJeannette, on these occasions, was in the habit of standing beside\r\nthe chair of her mistress, and chatting with her; and then, if the\r\nchatting was much prolonged, she would gradually sink down upon the\r\ncorner of a chair herself,--and then the two women would be very\r\ncomfortable together over the fire, Jeannette never forgetting that\r\nshe was the servant, and Mrs. Greenow never forgetting that she was\r\nthe mistress.\r\n\r\n"And why should they quarrel, Jeannette? It\'s very foolish."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about being foolish, ma\'am; but it\'s the most natural\r\nthing in life. If I had two beaux as was a-courting me together,\r\nin course I should expect as they would punch each other\'s heads.\r\nThere\'s some girls do it a purpose, because they like to see it. One\r\nat a time\'s what I say."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a young thing, Jeannette."\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am--yes; I am young, no doubt. But I won\'t say but what\r\nI\'ve had a beau, young as I look."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t suppose that I want beaux, as you call them?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, ma\'am, as you wants \'em exactly. That\'s as may be.\r\nThere they are; and if they was to blow each other\'s brains out in\r\nthe gig to-night, I shouldn\'t be a bit surprised for one. There\'s\r\nnothing won\'t quiet them at Oileymead to-night, if brandy-and-water\r\ndon\'t do it." As she said this, Jeannette slipt into her chair, and\r\nheld up her hands in token of the intensity of her fears.\r\n\r\n"Why, you silly child, they\'re not going home together at all. Did\r\nnot the Captain go away first?"\r\n\r\n"The Captain did go away first, certainly; but I thought perhaps it\r\nwas to get his pistols and fighting things ready."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t fight, Jeannette. Gentlemen have given over fighting."\r\n\r\n"Have they, ma\'am? That makes it much easier for ladies, no doubt.\r\nPerhaps them peaceable ways will come down to such as us in time.\r\nIt\'d be a comfort, I know, to them as are quiet given, like me. I\r\nhate to see men knocking each other\'s heads about,--I do. So Mr.\r\nCheesacre and the Captain won\'t fight, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they won\'t, you little fool, you."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear; I was so sure we should have had the papers all full of\r\nit,--and perhaps one of them stretched upon his bloody bier! I wonder\r\nwhich it would have been? I always made up my mind that the Captain\r\nwouldn\'t be wounded in any of his wital parts--unless it was his\r\nheart, you know, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"But why should they quarrel at all, Jeannette? It is the most\r\nfoolish thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am, I don\'t know about that. What else is they to do?\r\nThere\'s some things as you can cry halves about, but there\'s no\r\ncrying halves about this."\r\n\r\n"About what, Jeannette?"--"Why, about you, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Jeannette, I wonder how you can say such things; as if I, in my\r\nposition, had ever said a word to encourage either of them. You know\r\nit\'s not true, Jeannette, and you shouldn\'t say so." Whereupon Mrs.\r\nGreenow put her handkerchief to her eyes, and Jeannette, probably in\r\ntoken of contrition, put her apron to hers.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, ma\'am, no lady could have behaved better through it than\r\nyou have done, and goodness knows you have been tried hard."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have, Jeannette."\r\n\r\n"And if gentlemen will make fools of themselves, it isn\'t your fault;\r\nis it, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"But I\'m so sorry that they should have quarrelled. They were such\r\ndear friends, you know;--quite all in all to each other."\r\n\r\n"When you\'ve settled which it\'s to be, ma\'am, that\'ll all come right\r\nagain,--seeing that gentlefolks like them have given up fighting, as\r\nyou say." Then there was a little pause. "I suppose, ma\'am, it won\'t\r\nbe Mr. Cheesacre? To be sure, he\'s a man as is uncommonly well to do\r\nin the world."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that to me, Jeannette? I shall ever regard Mr. Cheesacre\r\nas a dear friend who has been very good to me at a time of trouble;\r\nbut he\'ll never be more than that."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'ll be the Captain, ma\'am? I\'m sure, for my part, I\'ve always\r\nthought the Captain was the nicer gentleman of the two,--and have\r\nalways said so."\r\n\r\n"He\'s nothing to me, girl."\r\n\r\n"And as for money,--what\'s the good of having more than enough? If he\r\ncan bring love, you can bring money; can\'t you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s nothing to me, girl," repeated Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"But he will be?" said Jeannette, plainly asking a question.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m sure! What\'s the world come to, I wonder, when you sit\r\nyourself down there, and cross-examine your mistress in that way! Get\r\nto bed, will you? It\'s near ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"I hope I haven\'t said anything amiss, ma\'am;" and Jeannette rose\r\nfrom her seat.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my fault for encouraging you," said Mrs. Greenow. "Go\r\ndown-stairs and finish your work, do; and then take yourself off to\r\nbed. Next week we shall have to be packing up, and there\'ll be all my\r\nthings to see to before that." So Jeannette got up and departed, and\r\nafter some few further thoughts about Captain Bellfield, Mrs. Greenow\r\nherself went to her bedroom.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre, when he drove back to Oileymead alone from Norwich,\r\nafter dining with Mrs. Greenow, had kept himself hot, and almost\r\ncomfortable, with passion against Bellfield; and his heat, if not\r\nhis comfort, had been sustained by his seeing the Captain, with his\r\nportmanteau, escaping just as he reached his own homestead. But early\r\non the following morning his mind reverted to Mrs. Greenow, and he\r\nremembered, with anything but satisfaction, some of the hard things\r\nwhich she had said to him. He had made mistakes in his manner of\r\nwooing. He was quite aware of that now, and was determined that they\r\nshould be rectified for the future. She had rebuked him for having\r\nsaid nothing about his love. He would instantly mend that fault.\r\nAnd she had bidden him not to be so communicative about his wealth.\r\nHenceforth he would be dumb on that subject. Nevertheless, he could\r\nnot but think that the knowledge of his circumstances which the lady\r\nalready possessed, must be of service to him. "She can\'t really\r\nlike a poor beggarly wretch who hasn\'t got a shilling," he said to\r\nhimself. He was very far from feeling that the battle was already\r\nlost. Her last word to him had been an assurance of her friendship;\r\nand then why should she have been at so much trouble to tell him the\r\nway in which he ought to address her if she were herself indifferent\r\nas to his addresses? He was, no doubt, becoming tired of his\r\ncourtship, and heartily wished that the work were over; but he was\r\nnot minded to give it up. He therefore prepared himself for another\r\nattack, and took himself into Norwich without seeking counsel from\r\nany one. He could not trust himself to think that she could really\r\nwish to refuse him after all the encouragement she had given him. On\r\nthis occasion he put on no pink shirt or shiny boots, being deterred\r\nfrom doing so by a remembrance of Captain Bellfield\'s ridicule;\r\nbut, nevertheless, he dressed himself with considerable care. He\r\nclothed his nether person in knickerbockers, with tight, leathern,\r\nbright-coloured gaiters round his legs, being conscious of certain\r\nmanly graces and symmetrical proportions which might, as he thought,\r\nstand him in good stead. And he put on a new shooting-coat, the\r\nbuttons on which were elaborate, and a wonderful waistcoat worked\r\nover with foxes\' heads. He completed his toilet with a round,\r\nlow-crowned hat, with dog\'s-skin gloves, and a cutting whip. Thus\r\narmed he went forth resolved to conquer or to die,--as far as death\r\nmight result from any wound which Mrs. Greenow might be able to give\r\nhim. He waited, on this occasion, for the coming of no market-day;\r\nindeed, the journey into the city was altogether special, and he was\r\ndesirous that she should know that such was the case. He drove at a\r\ngreat pace into the inn-yard, threw his reins to the ostler, took\r\njust one glass of cherry-brandy at the bar, and then marched off\r\nacross the market-place to the Close, with quiet and decisive steps.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Cheesacre?" said a friendly voice, in one of the narrow\r\nstreets. "Who expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday!" It was\r\nGrimsby, the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwich, a country gentleman,\r\nand one, therefore, to whom Cheesacre would generally pay much\r\nrespect; but on this occasion he did not even pull up for an instant,\r\nor moderate his pace. "A little bit of private business," he said,\r\nand marched onwards with his head towards the Close. "I\'m not going\r\nto be afraid of a woman--not if I know it," he said to himself;\r\nbut, nevertheless, at a certain pastrycook\'s, of whose shop he had\r\nknowledge, he pulled up and had another glass of cherry-brandy.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow is at home," he said to Jeannette, not deigning to ask\r\nany question.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, sir; she is at home," said Jeannette, conscious that some\r\noccasion had arrived; and in another second he was in the presence of\r\nhis angel.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre, whoever expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday?"\r\nsaid the lady, as she welcomed him, using almost the same words\r\nas his friend had done in the street. Why should not he come into\r\nNorwich on a Thursday, as well as any one else? Did they suppose\r\nthat he was tied for ever to his ploughs and carts? He was minded to\r\nconduct himself with a little spirit on this occasion, and to improve\r\nthe opinion which Mrs. Greenow had formed about him. On this account\r\nhe answered her somewhat boldly.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing when I may be in Norwich, Mrs. Greenow, or when\r\nI mayn\'t. I\'m one of those men of whom nobody knows anything certain,\r\nexcept that I pay as I go." Then he remembered that he was not to\r\nmake any more boasts about his money, and he endeavoured to cover the\r\nerror. "There\'s one other thing they may all know if they please, but\r\nwe won\'t say what that is just at present."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you sit down, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--thank you,--I will sit down for a few minutes if you\'ll let\r\nme, Mrs. Greenow. Mrs. Greenow, I\'m in such a state of mind that I must\r\nput an end to it, or else I shall be going mad, and doing somebody a\r\ndamage."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! what has happened to you? You\'re going out shooting,\r\npresently; are you not?" and Mrs. Greenow looked down at his garments.\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs. Greenow, I\'m not going out shooting. I put on these things\r\nbecause I thought I might take a shot as I came along. But I couldn\'t\r\nbring myself to do it, and then I wouldn\'t take them off again. What\r\ndoes it matter what a man wears?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, so long as he is decent."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m always that, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes. More than that, I should say. I consider you to be\r\nrather gay in your attire."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pretend to anything of that kind, Mrs. Greenow. I like to\r\nbe nice, and all that kind of thing. There are people who think that\r\nbecause a man farms his own land, he must be always in the muck. It\r\nis the case, of course, with those who have to make their rent and\r\nliving out of it." Then he remembered that he was again treading on\r\nforbidden ground, and stopped himself. "But it don\'t matter what a\r\nman wears if his heart isn\'t easy within him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should speak in that way, Mr. Cheesacre; but\r\nit\'s what I have felt every hour since--since Greenow left me."\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre was rather at a loss to know how he should begin. This\r\nallusion to the departed one did not at all assist him. He had so\r\noften told the widow that care killed a cat, and that a live dog was\r\nbetter than a dead lion; and had found so little efficacy in the\r\nproverbs, that he did not care to revert to them. He was aware that\r\nsome more decided method of proceeding was now required. Little hints\r\nat love-making had been all very well in the earlier days of their\r\nacquaintance; but there must be something more than little hints\r\nbefore he could hope to bring the matter to a favourable conclusion.\r\nThe widow herself had told him that he ought to talk about love; and\r\nhe had taken two glasses of cherry-brandy, hoping that they might\r\nenable him to do so. He had put on a coat with brilliant buttons, and\r\nnew knickerbockers, in order that he might be master of the occasion.\r\nHe was resolved to call a spade a spade, and to speak boldly of his\r\npassion; but how was he to begin? There was the difficulty. He was\r\nnow seated in a chair, and there he remained silent for a minute or\r\ntwo, while she smoothed her eyebrows with her handkerchief after her\r\nlast slight ebullition of grief.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow," he exclaimed at last, jumping up before her; "dearest\r\nMrs. Greenow; darling Mrs. Greenow, will you be my wife? There! I\r\nhave said it at last, and I mean it. Everything that I\'ve got shall\r\nbe yours. Of course I speak specially of my hand and heart. As for\r\nlove;--oh, Arabella, if you only knew me! I don\'t think there\'s a\r\nman in Norfolk better able to love a woman than I am. Ever since I\r\nfirst saw you at Yarmouth, I\'ve been in love to that extent that I\'ve\r\nnot known what I\'ve been about. If you\'ll ask them at home, they\'ll\r\ntell you that I\'ve not been able to look after anything about the\r\nplace,--not as it should be done. I haven\'t really. I don\'t suppose\r\nI\'ve opened the wages book half a dozen times since last July."\r\n\r\n"And has that been my fault, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word it has. I can\'t move about anywhere without thinking\r\nabout you. My mind\'s made up; I won\'t stay at Oileymead unless you\r\nwill come and be its mistress."\r\n\r\n"Not stay at Oileymead?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I\'ll let the place, and go and travel somewheres. What\'s\r\nthe use of my hanging on there without the woman of my heart? I\r\ncouldn\'t do it, Mrs. Greenow; I couldn\'t, indeed. Of course I\'ve got\r\neverything there that money can buy,--but it\'s all of no use to a man\r\nthat\'s in love. Do you know, I\'ve come quite to despise money and\r\nstock, and all that sort of thing. I haven\'t had my banker\'s book\r\nhome these last three months. Only think of that now."\r\n\r\n"But how can I help you, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Just say one word, and the thing\'ll be done. Say you\'ll be my wife?\r\nI\'ll be so good to you. I will, indeed. As for your fortune, I don\'t\r\ncare that for it! I\'m not like somebody else; it\'s yourself I want.\r\nYou shall be my pet, and my poppet, and my dearest little duck all\r\nthe days of your life."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Cheesacre; it cannot be."\r\n\r\n"And why not? Look here, Arabella!" At these words he rose from his\r\nchair, and coming immediately before her, went down on both knees\r\nso close to her as to prevent the possibility of her escaping from\r\nhim. There could be no doubt as to the efficacy of the cherry-brandy.\r\nThere he was, well down on his knees; but he had not got down so\r\nlow without some little cracking and straining on the part of the\r\ngaiters with which his legs were encompassed. He, in his passion, had\r\nprobably omitted to notice this; but Mrs. Greenow, who was more cool\r\nin her present temperament, was painfully aware that he might not be\r\nable to rise with ease.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre, don\'t make a fool of yourself. Get up," said she.\r\n\r\n"Never, till you have told me that you will be mine!"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll remain there for ever, which will be inconvenient. I\r\nwon\'t have you take hold of my hand, Mr. Cheesacre. I tell you to have\r\ndone." Whereupon his grasp upon her hand was released; but he made no\r\nattempt to rise.\r\n\r\n"I never saw a man look so much like a fool in my life," said she.\r\n"If you don\'t get up, I\'ll push you over. There; don\'t you hear?\r\nThere\'s somebody coming."\r\n\r\nBut Cheesacre, whose senses were less acute than the lady\'s, did not\r\nhear. "I\'ll never get up," said he, "till you have bid me hope."\r\n\r\n"Bid you play the fiddle. Get away from my knees, at any rate.\r\nThere;--he\'ll be in the room now before--"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Cheesacre disturbed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCheesacre now did hear a sound of steps, and the door was opened\r\nwhile he made his first futile attempt to get back to a standing\r\nposition. The door was opened, and Captain Bellfield entered. "I\r\nbeg ten thousand pardons," said he, "but as I did not see Jeannette,\r\nI ventured to come in. May I venture to congratulate my friend\r\nCheesacre on his success?"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cheesacre had risen; but he had done so slowly, and\r\nwith evident difficulty. "I\'ll trouble you to leave the room, Captain\r\nBellfield," said he. "I\'m particularly engaged with Mrs. Greenow, as\r\nany gentleman might have seen."\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t the slightest difficulty in seeing it, old fellow,"\r\nsaid the Captain. "Shall I wish you joy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll trouble you to leave the room, sir," said Cheesacre, walking up\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if Mrs. Greenow will desire me to do so," said the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Greenow felt herself called upon to speak.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I must beg that you will not make my drawing-room a\r\nplace for quarrelling. Captain Bellfield, lest there should be any\r\nmisconception, I must beg you to understand that the position in\r\nwhich you found Mr. Cheesacre was one altogether of his own seeking.\r\nIt was not with my consent that he was there."\r\n\r\n"I can easily believe that, Mrs. Greenow," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"Who cares what you believe, sir?" said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen! gentlemen! this is really unkind. Captain Bellfield, I\r\nthink I had better ask you to withdraw."\r\n\r\n"By all means," said Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"As it is absolutely necessary that I should give Mr. Cheesacre a\r\ndefinite answer after what has occurred--"\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Captain Bellfield, preparing to go. "I\'ll take\r\nanother opportunity of paying my respects to you. Perhaps I might be\r\nallowed to come this evening?"\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Greenow half assented with an uncertain nod, and then\r\nthe Captain went. As soon as the door was closed behind his back, Mr.\r\nCheesacre again prepared to throw himself into his former position,\r\nbut to this Mrs. Greenow decidedly objected. If he were allowed to\r\ngo down again, there was no knowing what force might be necessary to\r\nraise him. "Mr. Cheesacre," she said, "let there be an end to this\r\nlittle farce between us."\r\n\r\n"Farce!" said he, standing with his hand on his heart, and his legs\r\nand knickerbockers well displayed.\r\n\r\n"It is certainly either a farce or a mistake. If the latter,--and I\r\nhave been at all to blame,--I ask your pardon most sincerely."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll be Mrs. Cheesacre; won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Cheesacre; no. One husband is enough for any woman, and mine\r\nlies buried at Birmingham."\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn it!" said he, in utter disgust at this further reference\r\nto Mr. Greenow. The expression, at such a moment, militated against\r\ncourtesy; but even Mrs. Greenow herself felt that the poor man had\r\nbeen subjected to provocation.\r\n\r\n"Let us part friends," said she, offering him her hand.\r\n\r\nBut he turned his back upon her, for there was something in his eye\r\nthat he wanted to hide. I believe that he really did love her, and\r\nthat at this moment he would have taken her, even though he had\r\nlearned that her fortune was gone.\r\n\r\n"Will you not give me your hand," said she, "in token that there is\r\nno anger between us?"\r\n\r\n"Do think about it again--do!" said he. "If there\'s anything you\r\nlike to have changed, I\'ll change it at once. I\'ll give up Oileymead\r\naltogether, if you don\'t like being so near the farm-yard. I\'ll give\r\nup anything; so I will. Mrs. Greenow, if you only knew how I\'ve set my\r\nheart upon it!" And now, though his back was turned, the whimpering\r\nof his voice told plainly that tears were in his eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was a little touched. No woman would feel disposed to marry a man\r\nsimply because he cried, and perhaps few women would be less likely\r\nto give way to such tenderness than Mrs. Greenow. She understood men\r\nand women too well, and had seen too much both of the world\'s rough\r\nside and of its smooth side to fall into such a blunder as that; but\r\nshe was touched. "My friend," she said, putting her hand upon his\r\narm, "think no more of it."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t help thinking of it," said he, almost blubbering in his\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said she, still touching him with her hand. "Why, Mr.\r\nCheesacre, how can you bring yourself to care for an old woman like\r\nme, when so many pretty young ladies would give their eyes to get a\r\nkind word from you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any young lady," said he.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Charlie Fairstairs, who would make as good a wife as any\r\ngirl I know."\r\n\r\n"Psha! Charlie Fairstairs, indeed!" The very idea of having such a\r\nbride palmed off upon him did something to restore him to his manly\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n"Or my niece, Kate Vavasor, who has a nice little fortune of her own,\r\nand who is as accomplished as she is good-looking."\r\n\r\n"She\'s nothing to me, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you never asked her to be anything. If I get her to\r\ncome back to Yarmouth next summer, will you think about it? You want\r\na wife, and you couldn\'t do better if you searched all England over.\r\nIt would be so pleasant for us to be such near friends; wouldn\'t it?"\r\nAnd again she put her hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow, just at present there\'s only one woman in the world\r\nthat I can think of."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s my niece."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s yourself. I\'m a broken-hearted man,--I am, indeed. I\r\ndidn\'t ever think I should feel so much about a thing of the kind--I\r\ndidn\'t, really. I hardly know what to do with myself; but I suppose\r\nI\'d better go back to Oileymead." He had become so painfully\r\nunconscious of his new coat and his knickerbockers that it was\r\nimpossible not to pity him. "I shall always hate the place now," he\r\nsaid,--"always."\r\n\r\n"That will pass away. You\'d be as happy as a king there, if you\'d\r\ntake Kate for your queen."\r\n\r\n"And what\'ll you do, Mrs. Greenow?"\r\n\r\n"What shall I do?"--"Yes; what will you do?"\r\n\r\n"That is, if you marry Kate? Why, I\'ll come and stay with you half my\r\ntime, and nurse the children, as an old grand-aunt should."\r\n\r\n"But about--." Then he hesitated, and she asked him of what he was\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to take that man Bellfield, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Cheesacre, that\'s rank jealousy. What right can you have to\r\nask me whether I shall take any man or no man? The chances are that I\r\nshall remain as I am till I\'m carried to my grave; but I\'m not going\r\nto give any pledge about it to you or to any one."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know that man, Mrs. Greenow; you don\'t, indeed. I tell\r\nit you as your friend. Does not it stand to reason, when he has got\r\nnothing in the world, that he must be a beggar? It\'s all very well\r\nsaying that when a man is courting a lady, he shouldn\'t say much\r\nabout his money; but you won\'t make me believe that any man will make\r\na good husband who hasn\'t got a shilling. And for lies, there\'s no\r\nbeating him!"\r\n\r\n"Why, then, has he been such a friend of yours?"\r\n\r\n"Well, because I\'ve been foolish. I took up with him just because he\r\nlooked pleasant, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"And you want to prevent me from doing the same thing."\r\n\r\n"If you were to marry him, Mrs. Greenow, it\'s my belief I should do\r\nhim a mischief; it is, really. I don\'t think I could stand it;--a\r\nmean, skulking beggar! I suppose I\'d better go now?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if that\'s the way you choose to talk about my friends."\r\n\r\n"Friends, indeed! Well, I won\'t say any more at present. I suppose if\r\nI was to talk for ever it wouldn\'t be any good?"\r\n\r\n"Come and talk to Kate Vavasor for ever, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\nTo this he made no reply, but went forth from the house, and got\r\nhis gig, and drove himself home to Oileymead, thinking of his\r\ndisappointment with all the bitterness of a young lover. "I didn\'t\r\never think I should ever care so much about anything," he said, as he\r\ntook himself up to bed that night.\r\n\r\nThat evening Captain Bellfield did call in the Close, as he had said\r\nhe would do, but he was not admitted. "Her mistress was very bad with\r\na headache," Jeannette said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nPreparations for Lady Monk\'s Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in April, the Easter recess being all over, Lady Monk gave\r\na grand party in London. Lady Monk\'s town house was in Gloucester\r\nSquare. It was a large mansion, and Lady Monk\'s parties in London\r\nwere known to be very great affairs. She usually gave two or three in\r\nthe season, and spent a large portion of her time and energy in so\r\narranging matters that her parties should be successful. As this was\r\nher special line in life, a failure would have been very distressing\r\nto her;--and we may also say very disgraceful, taking into\r\nconsideration, as we should do in forming our judgement on the\r\nsubject, the very large sums of Sir Cosmo\'s money which she spent in\r\nthis way. But she seldom did fail. She knew how to select her days,\r\nso as not to fall foul of other events. It seldom happened that\r\npeople could not come to her because of a division which occupied\r\nall the Members of Parliament, or that they were drawn away by the\r\nsuperior magnitude of some other attraction in the world of fashion.\r\nThis giving of parties was her business, and she had learned it\r\nthoroughly. She worked at it harder than most men work at their\r\ntrades, and let us hope that the profits were consolatory.\r\n\r\nIt was generally acknowledged to be the proper thing to go to Lady\r\nMonk\'s parties. There were certain people who were asked, and who\r\nwent as a matter of course,--people who were by no means on intimate\r\nterms with Lady Monk, or with Sir Cosmo; but they were people to have\r\nwhom was the proper thing, and they were people who understood that\r\nto go to Lady Monk\'s was the proper thing for them. The Duchess of\r\nSt. Bungay was always there, though she hated Lady Monk, and Lady Monk\r\nalways abused her; but a card was sent to the Duchess in the same way\r\nas the Lord Mayor invites a Cabinet Minister to dinner, even though\r\nthe one man might believe the other to be a thief. And Mrs. Conway\r\nSparkes was generally there; she went everywhere. Lady Monk did not\r\nat all know why Mrs. Conway Sparkes was so favoured by the world;\r\nbut there was the fact, and she bowed to it. Then there were another\r\nset, the members of which were or were not invited, according to\r\ncircumstances, at the time; and these were the people who were\r\nprobably the most legitimate recipients of Lady Monk\'s hospitality.\r\nOld family friends of her husband were among the number. Let the\r\nTuftons come in April, and perhaps again in May; then they will not\r\nfeel their exclusion from that seventh heaven of glory,--the great\r\nculminating crush in July. Scores of young ladies who really loved\r\nparties belonged to this set. The mothers and aunts knew Lady Monk\'s\r\nsisters and cousins. They accepted so much of Lady Monk\'s good\r\nthings as she vouchsafed them, and were thankful. Then there was\r\nanother lot, which generally became, especially on that great July\r\noccasion, the most numerous of the three. It comprised all those\r\nwho made strong interest to obtain admittance within her ladyship\'s\r\nhouse,--who struggled and fought almost with tooth and nail to get\r\ninvitations. Against these people Lady Monk carried on an internecine\r\nwar. Had she not done so she would have been swamped by them, and\r\nher success would have been at an end; but yet she never dreamed of\r\nshutting her doors against them altogether, or of saying boldly that\r\nnone such should hamper her staircases. She knew that she must yield,\r\nbut her effort was made to yield to as few as might be possible. When\r\nshe was first told by her factotum in these operations that Mr. Bott\r\nwanted to come, she positively declined to have him. When it was\r\nafterwards intimated to her that the Duchess of St. Bungay had made a\r\npoint of it, she sneered at the Duchess, and did not even then yield.\r\nBut when at last it was brought home to her understanding that Mr.\r\nPalliser wished it, and that Mr. Palliser probably would not come\r\nhimself unless his wishes were gratified, she gave way. She was\r\nespecially anxious that Lady Glencora should come to her gathering,\r\nand she knew that Lady Glencora could not be had without Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nIt was very much desired by her that Lady Glencora should be there.\r\n"Burgo," said she to her nephew, one morning, "look here." Burgo was\r\nat the time staying with his aunt, in Gloucester Square, much to the\r\nannoyance of Sir Cosmo, who had become heartily tired of his nephew.\r\nThe aunt and the nephew had been closeted together more than once\r\nlately, and perhaps they understood each other better now than they\r\nhad done down at Monkshade. The aunt had handed a little note to\r\nBurgo, which he read and then threw back to her. "You see that she is\r\nnot afraid of coming," said Lady Monk.\r\n\r\n"I suppose she doesn\'t think much about it," said Burgo.\r\n\r\n"If that\'s what you really believe, you\'d better give it up. Nothing\r\non earth would justify such a step on your part except a thorough\r\nconviction that she is attached to you."\r\n\r\nBurgo looked at the fireplace, almost savagely, and his aunt looked\r\nat him very keenly. "Well," she said, "if there\'s to be an end of it,\r\nlet there be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'d better hang myself," he said.\r\n\r\n"Burgo, I will not have you here if you talk to me in that way. I am\r\ntrying to help you once again; but if you look like that, and talk\r\nlike that, I will give it up."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'d better give it up."\r\n\r\n"Are you becoming cowardly at last? With all your faults I never\r\nexpected that of you."\r\n\r\n"No; I am not a coward. I\'d go out and fight him at two paces\'\r\ndistance with the greatest pleasure in the world."\r\n\r\n"You know that\'s nonsense, Burgo. It\'s downright braggadocio. Men do\r\nnot fight now; nor at any time would a man be called upon to fight,\r\nbecause you simply wanted to take his wife from him. If you had done\r\nit, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"How am I to do it? I\'d do it to-morrow if it depended on me. No one\r\ncan say that I\'m afraid of anybody or of anything."\r\n\r\n"I suppose something in the matter depends on her?"\r\n\r\n"I believe she loves me,--if you mean that?"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Burgo," and the considerate aunt gave to the impoverished\r\nand ruined nephew such counsel as she, in accordance with her lights,\r\nwas enabled to bestow. "I think you were much wronged in that matter.\r\nAfter what had passed I thought that you had a right to claim Lady\r\nGlencora as your wife. Mr. Palliser, in my mind, behaved very wrongly\r\nin stepping in between you and--you and such a fortune as hers, in\r\nthat way. He cannot expect that his wife should have any affection\r\nfor him. There is nobody alive who has a greater horror of anything\r\nimproper in married women than I have. I have always shown it. When\r\nLady Madeline Madtop left her husband, I would never allow her to\r\ncome inside my doors again,--though I have no doubt he ill-used her\r\ndreadfully, and there was nothing ever proved between her and Colonel\r\nGraham. One can\'t be too particular in such matters. But here,\r\nif you,--if you can succeed, you know, I shall always regard the\r\nPalliser episode in Lady Glencora\'s life as a tragical accident. I\r\nshall indeed. Poor dear! It was done exactly as they make nuns of\r\ngirls in Roman Catholic countries; and as I should think no harm\r\nof helping a nun out of her convent, so I should think no harm of\r\nhelping her now. If you are to say anything to her, I think you might\r\nhave an opportunity at the party."\r\n\r\nBurgo was still looking at the fireplace; and he sat on, looking and\r\nstill looking, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"You can think of what I have said, Burgo," continued his aunt,\r\nmeaning that he should get up and go. But he did not go. "Have you\r\nanything more that you wish to say to me?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got no money," said Burgo, still looking at the fireplace.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora\'s property was worth not less than fifty thousand\r\na year. He was a young man ambitious of obtaining that almost\r\nincredible amount of wealth, and who once had nearly reached it, by\r\nmeans of her love. His present obstacle consisted in his want of a\r\ntwenty-pound note! "I\'ve got no money." The words were growled out\r\nrather than spoken, and his eyes were never turned even for a moment\r\ntowards his aunt\'s face.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve never got any money," said she, speaking almost with passion.\r\n\r\n"How can I help it? I can\'t make money. If I had a couple of hundred\r\npounds, so that I could take her, I believe that she would go with\r\nme. It should not be my fault if she did not. It would have been all\r\nright if she had come to Monkshade."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got no money for you, Burgo. I have not five pounds belonging\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got--?"\r\n\r\n"What?" said Lady Monk, interrupting him sharply.\r\n\r\n"Would Cosmo lend it me?" said he, hesitating to go on with that\r\nsuggestion which he had been about to make. The Cosmo of whom he\r\nspoke was not his uncle, but his cousin. No eloquence could have\r\ninduced his uncle, Sir Cosmo, to lend him another shilling. But the\r\nson of the house was a man rich with his own wealth, and Burgo had\r\nnot taxed him for some years.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Lady Monk. "I never see him. Probably not."\r\n\r\n"It is hard," said Burgo. "Fancy that a man should be ruined for two\r\nhundred pounds, just at such a moment of his life as this!" He was\r\na man bold by nature, and he did make his proposition. "You have\r\njewels, aunt;--could you not raise it for me? I would redeem them\r\nwith the very first money that I got."\r\n\r\nLady Monk rose in a passion when the suggestion was first made,\r\nbut before the interview was over she had promised that she would\r\nendeavour to do something in the way of raising money for him yet,\r\nonce again. He was her favourite nephew, and the same almost to\r\nher as a child of her own. With one of her own children indeed she\r\nhad quarrelled, and of the other, a married daughter, she rarely\r\nsaw much. Such love as she had to give she gave to Burgo, and she\r\npromised him the money though she knew that she must raise it by some\r\nvillanous falsehood to her husband.\r\n\r\nOn the same morning Lady Glencora went to Queen Anne Street with the\r\npurpose of inducing Alice to go to Lady Monk\'s party; but Alice would\r\nnot accede to the proposition, though Lady Glencora pressed it with\r\nall her eloquence. "I don\'t know her," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lady Glencora, "that\'s absurd. Half the people there\r\nwon\'t know her."\r\n\r\n"But they know her set, or know her friends,--or, at any rate, will\r\nmeet their own friends at her house. I should only bother you, and\r\nshould not in the least gratify myself."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, everybody will go who can, and I should have no sort\r\nof trouble in getting a card for you. Indeed I should simply write a\r\nnote and say I meant to bring you."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t do any such thing, for I certainly shall not go. I can\'t\r\nconceive why you should wish it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald will be there," said Lady Glencora, altering her voice\r\naltogether, and speaking in that low tone with which she used to win\r\nAlice\'s heart down at Matching. She was sitting close over the fire,\r\nleaning low, holding up her little hands as a screen to her face, and\r\nlooking at her companion earnestly. "I\'m sure that he will be there,\r\nthough nobody has told me."\r\n\r\n"That may be a reason for your staying away," said Alice, slowly,\r\n"but hardly a reason for my going with you."\r\n\r\nLady Glencora would not condescend to tell her friend in so many\r\nwords that she wanted her protection. She could not bring herself to\r\nsay that, though she wished it to be understood. "Ah! I thought you\r\nwould have gone," said she.\r\n\r\n"It would be contrary to all my habits," said Alice: "I never go to\r\npeople\'s houses when I don\'t know them. It\'s a kind of society which\r\nI don\'t like. Pray do not ask me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! very well. If it must be so, I won\'t press it." Lady Glencora\r\nhad moved the position of one of her hands so as to get it to her\r\npocket, and there had grasped a letter, which she still carried; but\r\nwhen Alice said those last cold words, "Pray do not ask me," she\r\nreleased the grasp, and left the letter where it was. "I suppose he\r\nwon\'t bite me, at any rate," she said, and she assumed that look of\r\nchildish drollery which she would sometimes put on, almost with a\r\ngrimace, but still with so much prettiness that no one who saw her\r\nwould regret it.\r\n\r\n"He certainly can\'t bite you, if you will not let him."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Alice, though they all say that Plantagenet is one of\r\nthe wisest men in London, I sometimes think that he is one of the\r\ngreatest fools. Soon after we came to town I told him that we had\r\nbetter not go to that woman\'s house. Of course he understood me. He\r\nsimply said that he wished that I should do so. \'I hate anything out\r\nof the way,\' he said. \'There can be no reason why my wife should not\r\ngo to Lady Monk\'s house as well as to any other.\' There was an end of\r\nit, you know, as far as anything I could do was concerned. But there\r\nwasn\'t an end of it with him. He insists that I shall go, but he\r\nsends my duenna with me. Dear Mrs. Marsham is to be there!"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll do you no harm, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that, Alice. In the first place, one doesn\'t like\r\nto be followed everywhere by a policeman, even though one isn\'t going\r\nto pick a pocket. And then, the devil is so strong within me, that I\r\nshould like to dodge the policeman. I can fancy a woman being driven\r\nto do wrong simply by a desire to show her policeman that she can be\r\ntoo many for him."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, you make me so wretched when you talk like that."\r\n\r\n"Will you go with me, then, so that I may have a policeman of my own\r\nchoosing? He asked me if I would mind taking Mrs. Marsham with me in\r\nmy carriage. So I up and spoke, very boldly, like the proud young\r\nporter, and told him I would not; and when he asked why not, I said\r\nthat I preferred taking a friend of my own,--a young friend, I said,\r\nand I then named you or my cousin, Lady Jane. I told him I should\r\nbring one or the other."\r\n\r\n"And was he angry?"\r\n\r\n"No; he took it very quietly,--saying something, in his calm way,\r\nabout hoping that I should get over a prejudice against one of\r\nhis earliest and dearest friends. He twits at me because I don\'t\r\nunderstand Parliament and the British Constitution, but I know more\r\nof them than he does about a woman. You are quite sure you won\'t go,\r\nthen?" Alice hesitated a moment. "Do," said Lady Glencora; and there\r\nwas an amount of persuasion in her accent which should, I think, have\r\novercome her cousin\'s scruples.\r\n\r\n"It is against the whole tenor of my life\'s way," she said, "And,\r\nGlencora, I am not happy myself. I am not fit for parties. I\r\nsometimes think that I shall never go into society again."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, you know."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is, but I cannot go now. I would if I really thought--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Lady Glencora, interrupting her. "I suppose I\r\nshall get through it. If he asks me to dance, I shall stand up with\r\nhim, just as though I had never seen him before." Then she remembered\r\nthe letter in her pocket,--remembered that at this moment she bore\r\nabout with her a written proposition from this man to go off with him\r\nand leave her husband\'s house. She had intended to show it to Alice\r\non this occasion; but as Alice had refused her request, she was glad\r\nthat she had not done so. "You\'ll come to me the morning after," said\r\nLady Glencora, as she went. This Alice promised to do; and then she\r\nwas left alone.\r\n\r\nAlice regretted,--regretted deeply that she had not consented to go\r\nwith her cousin. After all, of what importance had been her objection\r\nwhen compared with the cause for which her presence had been desired?\r\nDoubtless she would have been uncomfortable at Lady Monk\'s house;\r\nbut could she not have borne some hour or two of discomfort on her\r\nfriend\'s behalf? But, in truth, it was only after Lady Glencora had\r\nleft her that she began to understand the subject fully, and to feel\r\nthat she might possibly have been of service in a great danger. But\r\nit was too late now. Then she strove to comfort herself with the\r\nreflection that a casual meeting at an evening party in London could\r\nnot be perilous in the same degree as a prolonged sojourn together in\r\na country house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nHow Lady Glencora Went to Lady Monk\'s Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Monk\'s house in Gloucester Square was admirably well adapted for\r\nthe giving of parties. It was a large house, and seemed to the eyes\r\nof guests to be much larger than it was. The hall was spacious, and\r\nthe stairs went up in the centre, facing you as you entered the inner\r\nhall. Round the top of the stairs there was a broad gallery, with an\r\nornamented railing, and from this opened the doors into the three\r\nreception-rooms. There were two on the right, the larger of which\r\nlooked out backwards, and these two were connected by an archway, as\r\nthough made for folding-doors; but the doors, I believe, never were\r\nthere. Fronting the top of the staircase there was a smaller room,\r\nlooking out backwards, very prettily furnished, and much used by Lady\r\nMonk when alone. It was here that Burgo had held that conference with\r\nhis aunt of which mention has been made. Below stairs there was the\r\ngreat dining-room, on which, on these occasions, a huge buffet was\r\nerected for refreshments,--what I may call a masculine buffet, as it\r\nwas attended by butlers and men in livery,--and there was a smaller\r\nroom looking out into the square, in which there was a feminine\r\nbattery for the dispensing of tea and such like smaller good things,\r\nand from which female aid could be attained for the arrangement or\r\nmending of dresses in a further sanctum within it. For such purposes\r\nas that now on foot the house was most commodious. Lady Monk, on\r\nthese occasions, was moved by a noble ambition to do something\r\ndifferent from that done by her neighbours in similar circumstances,\r\nand therefore she never came forward to receive her guests. She\r\nensconced herself, early in the evening, in that room at the head of\r\nthe stairs, and there they who chose to see her made their way up to\r\nher, and spoke their little speeches. They who thought her to be a\r\ngreat woman,--and many people did think her to be great,--were wont\r\nto declare that she never forgot those who did come, or those who did\r\nnot. And even they who desired to describe her as little,--for even\r\nLady Monk had enemies,--would hint that though she never came out\r\nof the room, she would rise from her chair and make a step towards\r\nthe door whenever any name very high in fashionable life greeted\r\nher ears. So that a mighty Cabinet Minister, or a duchess in great\r\nrepute, or any special wonder of the season, could not fail of\r\nentering her precincts and being seen there for a few moments. It\r\nwould, of course, happen that the doorway of her chamber would become\r\nblocked; but there were precautions taken to avoid this inconvenience\r\nas far as possible, and one man in livery was employed to go\r\nbackwards and forwards between his mistress and the outer world, so\r\nas to keep the thread of a passage open.\r\n\r\nBut though Lady Monk was in this way enabled to rest herself during\r\nher labours, there was much in her night\'s work which was not\r\naltogether exhilarating. Ladies would come into her small room and\r\nsit there by the hour, with whom she had not the slightest wish\r\nto hold conversation. The Duchess of St. Bungay would always be\r\nthere,--so that there was a special seat in one corner of the room\r\nwhich was called the Duchess\' stool. "I shouldn\'t care a straw about\r\nher," Lady Monk had been heard to complain, "if she would talk\r\nto anybody. But nobody will talk to her, and then she listens to\r\neverything."\r\n\r\nThere had been another word or two between Burgo Fitzgerald and his\r\naunt before the evening came, a word or two in the speaking of which\r\nshe had found some difficulty. She was prepared with the money,--with\r\nthat two hundred pounds for which he had asked,--obtained with what\r\nwiles, and lies, and baseness of subterfuge I need not stop here to\r\ndescribe. But she was by no means willing to give this over into her\r\nnephew\'s hands without security. She was willing to advance him this\r\nmoney; she had been willing even to go through unusual dirt to get\r\nit for him; but she was desirous that he should have it only for a\r\ncertain purpose. How could she bind him down to spend it as she would\r\nhave it spent? Could she undertake to hand it to him as soon as Lady\r\nGlencora should be in his power? Even though she could have brought\r\nherself to say as much,--and I think she might also have done so\r\nafter what she had said,--she could not have carried out such a\r\nplan. In that case the want would be instant, and the action must be\r\nrapid. She therefore had no alternative but to entrust him with the\r\nbank-notes at once. "Burgo," she said, "if I find that you deceive me\r\nnow, I will never trust you again." "All right," said Burgo, as he\r\nbarely counted the money before he thrust it into his breast-pocket.\r\n"It is lent to you for a certain purpose, should you happen to want\r\nit," she said, solemnly. "I do happen to want it very much," he\r\nanswered. She did not dare to say more; but as her nephew turned away\r\nfrom her with a step that was quite light in its gaiety, she almost\r\nfelt that she was already cozened. Let Burgo\'s troubles be as heavy\r\nas they might be, there was something to him ecstatic in the touch of\r\nready money which always cured them for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "All right," said Burgo, as he thrust the money\r\ninto his breast-pocket.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Lady Monk\'s party a few very uncomfortable words\r\npassed between Mr. Palliser and his wife.\r\n\r\n"Your cousin is not going, then?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Alice is not going."\r\n\r\n"Then you can give Mrs. Marsham a seat in your carriage?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible, Plantagenet. I thought I had told you that I had\r\npromised my cousin Jane."\r\n\r\n"But you can take three."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I can\'t,--unless you would like me to sit out with the\r\ncoachman."\r\n\r\nThere was something in this,--a tone of loudness, a touch of what he\r\ncalled to himself vulgarity,--which made him very angry. So he turned\r\naway from her, and looked as black as a thundercloud.\r\n\r\n"You must know, Plantagenet," she went on, "that it is impossible for\r\nthree women dressed to go out in one carriage. I am sure you wouldn\'t\r\nlike to see me afterwards if I had been one of them."\r\n\r\n"You need not have said anything to Lady Jane when Miss Vavasor\r\nrefused. I had asked you before that."\r\n\r\n"And I had told you that I liked going with young women, and not with\r\nold ones. That\'s the long and the short of it."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, I wish you would not use such expressions."\r\n\r\n"What! not the long and the short? It\'s good English. Quite as good\r\nas Mr. Bott\'s, when he said in the House the other night that the\r\nGovernment kept their accounts in a higgledy-piggledy way. You see, I\r\nhave been studying the debates, and you shouldn\'t be angry with me."\r\n\r\n"I am not angry with you. You speak like a child to say so. Then,\r\nI suppose, the carriage must go for Mrs. Marsham after it has taken\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"It shall go before. Jane will not be in a hurry, and I am sure I\r\nshall not."\r\n\r\n"She will think you very uncivil; that is all. I told her that she\r\ncould go with you when I heard that Miss Vavasor was not to be\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Then, Plantagenet, you shouldn\'t have told her so, and that\'s the\r\nlong--; but I mustn\'t say that. The truth is this, if you give me any\r\norders I\'ll obey them,--as far as I can. If I can\'t I\'ll say so. But\r\nif I\'m left to go by my own judgement, it\'s not fair that I should be\r\nscolded afterwards."\r\n\r\n"I have never scolded you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have. You have told me that I was uncivil."\r\n\r\n"I said that she would think you so."\r\n\r\n"Then, if it\'s only what she thinks, I don\'t care two straws about\r\nit. She may have the carriage to herself if she likes, but she shan\'t\r\nhave me in it,--not unless I\'m ordered to go. I don\'t like her, and I\r\nwon\'t pretend to like her. My belief is that she follows me about to\r\ntell you if she thinks that I do wrong."\r\n\r\n"Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"And that odious baboon with the red bristles does the same\r\nthing,--only he goes to her because he doesn\'t dare to go to you."\r\n\r\nPlantagenet Palliser was struck wild with dismay. He understood well\r\nwho it was whom his wife intended to describe; but that she should\r\nhave spoken of any man as a baboon with red bristles, was terrible to\r\nhis mind! He was beginning to think that he hardly knew how to manage\r\nhis wife. And the picture she had drawn was very distressing to him.\r\nShe had no mother; neither had he; and he had wished that Mrs. Marsham\r\nshould give to her some of that matronly assistance and guidance\r\nwhich a mother does give to her young married daughter. It was true,\r\ntoo, as he knew, that a word or two as to some socially domestic\r\nmatters had filtered through to him from Mr. Bott, down at Matching\r\nPriory, but only in such a way as to enable him to see what counsel\r\nit was needful that he should give. As for espionage over his\r\nwife,--no man could despise it more than he did! No man would be less\r\nwilling to resort to it! And now his wife was accusing him of keeping\r\nspies, both male and female.\r\n\r\n"Glencora!" he said again; and then he stopped, not knowing what to\r\nsay to her.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, it\'s better you should know at once what I feel about\r\nit. I don\'t suppose I\'m very good; indeed I dare say I\'m bad enough,\r\nbut these people about me won\'t make me any better. The duennas don\'t\r\nmake the Spanish ladies worth much."\r\n\r\n"Duennas!" After that, Lady Glencora sat herself down, and Mr.\r\nPalliser stood for some moments looking at her.\r\n\r\nIt ended in his making her a long speech, in which he said a good\r\ndeal of his own justice and forbearance, and something also of her\r\nfrivolity and childishness. He told her that his only complaint of\r\nher was that she was too young, and, as he did so, she made a little\r\ngrimace,--not to him, but to herself, as though saying to herself\r\nthat that was all he knew about it. He did not notice it, or, if he\r\ndid, his notice did not stop his eloquence. He assured her that he\r\nwas far from keeping any watch over her, and declared that she had\r\naltogether mistaken Mrs. Marsham\'s character. Then there was another\r\nlittle grimace. "There\'s somebody has mistaken it worse than I have,"\r\nthe grimace said. Of the bristly baboon he condescended to say\r\nnothing, and he wound up by giving her a cold kiss, and saying that\r\nhe would meet her at Lady Monk\'s.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came,--or rather the night,--the carriage went\r\nfirst for Mrs. Marsham, and having deposited her at Lady Monk\'s, went\r\nback to Park Lane for Lady Glencora. Then she had herself driven to\r\nSt. James\'s Square, to pick up Lady Jane, so that altogether the\r\ncoachman and horses did not have a good time of it. "I wish he\'d\r\nkeep a separate carriage for her," Lady Glencora said to her cousin\r\nJane,--having perceived that her servants were not in a good humour.\r\n"That would be expensive," said Lady Jane. "Yes, it would be\r\nexpensive," said Lady Glencora. She would not condescend to make any\r\nremark as to the non-importance of such expense to a man so wealthy\r\nas her husband, knowing that his wealth was, in fact, hers. Never to\r\nhim or to any other,--not even to herself,--had she hinted that much\r\nwas due to her because she had been magnificent as an heiress. There\r\nwere many things about this woman that were not altogether what a\r\nhusband might wish. She was not softly delicate in all her ways; but\r\nin disposition and temper she was altogether generous. I do not know\r\nthat she was at all points a lady, but had Fate so willed it she\r\nwould have been a thorough gentleman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham was by no means satisfied with the way in which she was\r\ntreated. She would not have cared to go at all to Lady Monk\'s party\r\nhad she supposed that she would have to make her entry there alone.\r\nWith Lady Glencora she would have seemed to receive some of that\r\nhomage which would certainly have been paid to her companion. The\r\ncarriage called, moreover, before she was fully ready, and the\r\nfootman, as he stood at the door to hand her in, had been very sulky.\r\nShe understood it all. She knew that Lady Glencora had positively\r\ndeclined her companionship; and if she resolved to be revenged, such\r\nresolution on her part was only natural. When she reached Lady Monk\'s\r\nhouse, she had to make her way up stairs all alone. The servants\r\ncalled her Mrs. Marsh, and under that name she got passed on into the\r\nfront drawing-room. There she sat down, not having seen Lady Monk,\r\nand meditated over her injuries.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven before Lady Glencora arrived, and Burgo Fitzgerald\r\nhad begun to think that his evil stars intended that he should never\r\nsee her again. He had been wickedly baulked at Monkshade, by what\r\ninfluence he had never yet ascertained; and now he thought that the\r\nsame influence must be at work to keep her again away from his aunt\'s\r\nhouse. He had settled in his mind no accurate plan of a campaign; he\r\nhad in his thoughts no fixed arrangement by which he might do the\r\nthing which he meditated. He had attempted to make some such plan;\r\nbut, as is the case with all men to whom thinking is an unusual\r\noperation, concluded at last that he had better leave it to the\r\ncourse of events. It was, however, obviously necessary that he should\r\nsee Lady Glencora before the course of events could be made to do\r\nanything for him. He had written to her, making his proposition in\r\nbold terms, and he felt that if she were utterly decided against him,\r\nher anger at his suggestion, or at least her refusal, would have\r\nbeen made known to him in some way. Silence did not absolutely give\r\nconsent, but it seemed to show that consent was not impossible. From\r\nten o\'clock to past eleven he stood about on the staircase of his\r\naunt\'s house, waiting for the name which he was desirous of hearing,\r\nand which he almost feared to hear. Men spoke to him, and women also,\r\nbut he hardly answered. His aunt once called him into her room, and\r\nwith a cautionary frown on her brow, bade him go dance. "Don\'t look\r\nso dreadfully preoccupied," she said to him in a whisper. But he\r\nshook his head at her, almost savagely, and went away, and did not\r\ndance. Dance! How was he to dance with such an enterprise as that\r\nupon his mind? Even to Burgo Fitzgerald the task of running away\r\nwith another man\'s wife had in it something which prevented dancing.\r\nLady Monk was older, and was able to regulate her feelings with more\r\nexactness. But Burgo, though he could not dance, went down into the\r\ndining-room and drank. He took a large beer-glass full of champagne\r\nand soon after that another. The drink did not flush his cheeks or\r\nmake his forehead red, or bring out the sweat-drops on his brow, as\r\nit does with some men; but it added a peculiar brightness to his blue\r\neyes. It was by the light of his eyes that men knew when Burgo had\r\nbeen drinking.\r\n\r\nAt last, while he was still in the supper room, he heard Lady\r\nGlencora\'s name announced. He had already seen Mr. Palliser come in\r\nand make his way up-stairs some quarter of an hour before; but as\r\nto that he was indifferent. He had known that the husband was to be\r\nthere. When the long-expected name reached his ears, his heart seemed\r\nto jump within him. What, on the spur of the moment, should he do?\r\nAs he had resolved that he would be doing,--that something should be\r\ndone, let it be what it might,--he hurried to the dining-room door,\r\nand was just in time to see and be seen as Lady Glencora was passing\r\nup the stairs. She was just above him as he got himself out into the\r\nhall, so that he could not absolutely greet her with his hand; but\r\nhe looked up at her, and caught her eye. He looked up, and moved his\r\nhand to her in token of salutation. She looked down at him, and the\r\nexpression of her face altered visibly as her glance met his. She\r\nbarely bowed to him,--with her eyes rather than with her head, but\r\nhe flattered himself that there was, at any rate, no anger in her\r\ncountenance. How beautiful he was as he gazed up at her, leaning\r\nagainst the wall as he stood, and watching her as she made her slow\r\nway up the stairs! She felt that his eyes were on her, and where the\r\nstairs turned she could not restrain herself from one other glance.\r\nAs her eyes fell on his again, his mouth opened, and she fancied that\r\nshe could hear the faint sigh that he uttered. It was a glorious\r\nmouth, such as the old sculptors gave to their marble gods! And\r\nBurgo, if it was so that he had not heart enough to love truly, could\r\nlook as though he loved. It was not in him deceit,--or what men call\r\nacting. The expression came to him naturally, though it expressed so\r\nmuch more than there was within; as strong words come to some men who\r\nhave no knowledge that they are speaking strongly. At this moment\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald looked as though it were possible that he might die\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora was met at the top of the stairs by Lady Monk, who came\r\nout to her, almost into the gallery, with her sweetest smile,--so\r\nthat the newly-arrived guest, of course, entered into the small\r\nroom. There sat the Duchess of St. Bungay on her stool in the corner,\r\nand there, next to the Duchess, but at the moment engaged in no\r\nconversation, stood Mr. Bott. There was another lady there, who\r\nstood very high in the world, and whom Lady Monk was very glad to\r\nwelcome--the young Marchioness of Hartletop. She was in slight\r\nmourning; for her father-in-law, the late Marquis, had died no\r\nt yet quite six months since. Very beautiful she was, and one whose\r\npresence at their houses ladies and gentlemen prized alike. She never\r\nsaid silly things, like the Duchess, never was troublesome as to\r\npeople\'s conduct to her, was always gracious, yet was never led away\r\ninto intimacies, was without peer the best-dressed woman in London,\r\nand yet gave herself no airs;--and then she was so exquisitely\r\nbeautiful. Her smile was loveliness itself. There were, indeed,\r\npeople who said that it meant nothing; but then, what should the\r\nsmile of a young married woman mean? She had not been born in the\r\npurple, like Lady Glencora, her father being a country clergyman who\r\nhad never reached a higher grade than that of an archdeacon; but she\r\nknew the ways of high life, and what an exigeant husband would demand\r\nof her, much better than poor Glencora. She would have spoken of no\r\nman as a baboon with a bristly beard. She never talked of the long\r\nand the short of it. She did not wander out o\' nights in winter among\r\nthe ruins. She made no fast friendship with ladies whom her lord did\r\nnot like. She had once, indeed, been approached by a lover since she\r\nhad been married,--Mr. Palliser himself having been the offender,--but\r\nshe had turned the affair to infinite credit and profit, had gained\r\nher husband\'s closest confidence by telling him of it all, had yet\r\nnot brought on any hostile collision, and had even dismissed her\r\nlover without annoying him. But then Lady Hartletop was a miracle of\r\na woman!\r\n\r\nLady Glencora was no miracle. Though born in the purple, she was\r\nmade of ordinary flesh and blood, and as she entered Lady Monk\'s\r\nlittle room, hardly knew how to recover herself sufficiently for\r\nthe purposes of ordinary conversation. "Dear Lady Glencora, do come\r\nin for a moment to my den. We were so sorry not to have you at\r\nMonkshade. We heard such terrible things about your health." Lady\r\nGlencora said that it was only a cold,--a bad cold. "Oh, yes; we\r\nheard,--something about moonlight and ruins. So like you, you know.\r\nI love that sort of thing, above all people; but it doesn\'t do;\r\ndoes it? Circumstances are so exacting. I think you know Lady\r\nHartletop;--and there\'s the Duchess of St. Bungay. Mr. Palliser was\r\nhere five minutes since." Then Lady Monk was obliged to get to her\r\ndoor again and Lady Glencora found herself standing close to Lady\r\nHartletop.\r\n\r\n"We saw Mr. Palliser just pass through," said Lady Hartletop, who was\r\nable to meet and speak of the man who had dared to approach her with\r\nhis love, without the slightest nervousness.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he said he should be here," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a great crowd," said Lady Hartletop. "I didn\'t think London\r\nwas so full."\r\n\r\n"Very great." said Lady Glencora, and then they had said to each\r\nother all that society required. Lady Glencora, as we know, could\r\ntalk with imprudent vehemence by the hour together if she liked her\r\ncompanion; but the other lady seldom committed herself by more words\r\nthan she had uttered now,--unless it was to her tirewoman.\r\n\r\n"How very well you are looking," said the Duchess. "And I heard you\r\nhad been so ill." Of that midnight escapade among the ruins it was\r\nfated that Lady Glencora should never hear the last.\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, Lady Glencowrer?" sounded in her ear, and there was a\r\ngreat red paw stuck out for her to take. But after what had passed\r\nbetween Lady Glencora and her husband to-day about Mr. Bott, she was\r\ndetermined that she would not take Mr. Bott\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"How are you, Mr. Bott?" she said. "I think I\'ll look for Mr. Palliser\r\nin the back room."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Glencora," whispered the Duchess, in an ecstasy of agony.\r\nLady Glencora turned and bowed her head to her stout friend. "Do let\r\nme go away with you. There\'s that woman, Mrs. Conway Sparkes, coming,\r\nand you know how I hate her." She had nothing to do but to take the\r\nDuchess under her wing, and they passed into the large room together.\r\nIt is, I think, more than probable that Mrs. Conway Sparkes had been\r\nbrought in by Lady Monk as the only way of removing the Duchess from\r\nher stool.\r\n\r\nJust within the dancing-room Lady Glencora found her husband,\r\nstanding in a corner, looking as though he were making calculations.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going away," said he, coming up to her. "I only just came\r\nbecause I said I would. Shall you be late?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"Shall you dance?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps once,--just to show that I\'m not an old woman."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t heat yourself. Good-bye." Then he went, and in the crush of\r\nthe doorway he passed Burgo Fitzgerald, whose eye was intently fixed\r\nupon his wife. He looked at Burgo, and some thought of that young\r\nman\'s former hopes flashed across his mind,--some remembrance, too,\r\nof a caution that had been whispered to him; but for no moment did a\r\nsuspicion come to him that he ought to stop and watch by his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nHow Lady Glencora Came Back from Lady Monk\'s Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald remained for a minute or two leaning where we\r\nlast saw him,--against the dining-room wall at the bottom of the\r\nstaircase; and as he did so some thoughts that were almost solemn\r\npassed across his mind, This thing that he was about to do, or to\r\nattempt,--was it in itself a good thing, and would it be good for her\r\nwhom he pretended to love? What would be her future if she consented\r\nnow to go with him, and to divide herself from her husband? Of his\r\nown future he thought not at all. He had never done so. Even when he\r\nhad first found himself attracted by the reputation of her wealth, he\r\ncannot be said to have looked forward in any prudential way to coming\r\nyears. His desire to put himself in possession of so magnificent\r\na fortune had simply prompted him, as he might have been prompted\r\nto play for a high stake at a gaming-table. But now, during these\r\nmoments, he did think a little of her. Would she be happy, simply\r\nbecause he loved her, when all women should cease to acknowledge\r\nher; when men would regard her as one degraded and dishonoured; when\r\nsociety should be closed against her; when she would be driven to\r\nlive loudly because the softness and graces of quiet life would be\r\ndenied to her? Burgo knew well what must be the nature of such a\r\nwoman\'s life in such circumstances. Would Glencora be happy with him\r\nwhile living such a life simply because he loved her? And, under such\r\ncircumstances, was it likely that he would continue to love her? Did\r\nhe not know himself to be the most inconstant of men, and the least\r\ntrustworthy? Leaning thus against the wall at the bottom of the\r\nstairs he did ask himself all these questions with something of true\r\nfeeling about his heart, and almost persuaded himself that he had\r\nbetter take his hat and wander forth anywhere into the streets. It\r\nmattered little what might become of himself. If he could drink\r\nhimself out of the world, it might be an end of things that would be\r\nnot altogether undesirable.\r\n\r\nBut then the remembrance of his aunt\'s two hundred pounds came upon\r\nhim, which money he even now had about him on his person, and a\r\ncertain idea of honour told him that he was bound to do that for\r\nwhich the money had been given to him. As to telling his aunt that he\r\nhad changed his mind, and, therefore, refunding the money--no such\r\nthought as that was possible to him! To give back two hundred pounds\r\nentire,--two hundred pounds which were already within his clutches,\r\nwas not within the compass of Burgo\'s generosity. Remembering the\r\ncash, he told himself that hesitation was no longer possible to\r\nhim. So he gathered himself up, stretched his hands over his head,\r\nuttered a sigh that was audible to all around him, and took himself\r\nup-stairs.\r\n\r\nHe looked in at his aunt\'s room, and then he saw her and was seen by\r\nher. "Well, Burgo," she said, with her sweetest smile, "have you been\r\ndancing?" He turned away from her without answering her, muttering\r\nsomething between his teeth about a cold-blooded Jezebel,--which, if\r\nshe had heard it, would have made her think him the most ungrateful\r\nof men. But she did not hear him, and smiled still as he went away,\r\nsaying something to Mrs. Conway Sparkes as to the great change for the\r\nbetter which had taken place in her nephew\'s conduct.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing who may not reform," said Mrs. Sparkes, with an\r\nemphasis which seemed to Lady Monk to be almost uncourteous.\r\n\r\nBurgo made his way first into the front room and then into the\r\nlarger room where the dancing was in progress, and there he saw Lady\r\nGlencora standing up in a quadrille with the Marquis of Hartletop.\r\nLord Hartletop was a man not much more given to conversation than\r\nhis wife, and Lady Glencora seemed to go through her work with very\r\nlittle gratification either in the dancing or in the society of her\r\npartner. She was simply standing up to dance, because, as she had\r\ntold Mr. Palliser, ladies of her age generally do stand up on such\r\noccasions. Burgo watched her as she crossed and re-crossed the room,\r\nand at last she was aware of his presence. It made no change in her,\r\nexcept that she became even somewhat less animated than she had been\r\nbefore. She would not seem to see him, nor would she allow herself to\r\nbe driven into a pretence of a conversation with her partner because\r\nhe was there. "I will go up to her at once, and ask her to waltz,"\r\nBurgo said to himself, as soon as the last figure of the quadrille\r\nwas in action. "Why should I not ask her as well as any other woman?"\r\nThen the music ceased, and after a minute\'s interval Lord Hartletop\r\ntook away his partner on his arm into another room. Burgo, who had\r\nbeen standing near the door, followed them at once. The crowd was\r\ngreat, so that he could not get near them or even keep them in sight,\r\nbut he was aware of the way in which they were going.\r\n\r\nIt was five minutes after this when he again saw her, and then she\r\nwas seated on a cane bench in the gallery, and an old woman was\r\nstanding close to her, talking to her. It was Mrs. Marsham cautioning\r\nher against some petty imprudence, and Lady Glencora was telling that\r\nlady that she needed no such advice, in words almost as curt as those\r\nI have used. Lord Hartletop had left her, feeling that, as far as\r\nthat was concerned, he had done his duty for the night. Burgo knew\r\nnothing of Mrs. Marsham,--had never seen her before, and was quite\r\nunaware that she had any special connection with Mr. Palliser. It was\r\nimpossible, he thought, to find Lady Glencora in a better position\r\nfor his purpose, so he made his way up to her through the crowd, and\r\nmuttering some slight inaudible word, offered her his hand.\r\n\r\n"That will do very well thank you, Mrs. Marsham," Lady Glencora said\r\nat this moment. "Pray, do not trouble yourself," and then she gave\r\nher hand to Fitzgerald. Mrs. Marsham, though unknown to him, knew with\r\nquite sufficient accuracy who he was, and all his history, as far as\r\nit concerned her friend\'s wife. She had learned the whole story of\r\nthe loves of Burgo and Lady Glencora. Though Mr. Palliser had never\r\nmentioned that man\'s name to her, she was well aware that her duty\r\nas a duenna would make it expedient that she should keep a doubly\r\nwary eye upon him should he come near the sheepfold. And there he was,\r\nclose to them, almost leaning over them, with the hand of his late\r\nlady love,--the hand of Mr. Palliser\'s wife,--within his own! How Lady\r\nGlencora might have carried herself at this moment had Mrs. Marsham\r\nnot been there, it is bootless now to surmise; but it may be well\r\nunderstood that under Mrs. Marsham\'s immediate eye all her resolution\r\nwould be in Burgo\'s favour. She looked at him softly and kindly, and\r\nthough she uttered no articulate word, her countenance seemed to show\r\nthat the meeting was not unpleasant to her.\r\n\r\n"Will you waltz?" said Burgo,--asking it not at all as though it were\r\na special favour,--asking it exactly as he might have done had they\r\nbeen in the habit of dancing with each other every other night for\r\nthe last three months.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Lady Glencora will waltz to-night," said Mrs. Marsham,\r\nvery stiffly. She certainly did not know her business as a duenna, or\r\nelse the enormity of Burgo\'s proposition had struck her so forcibly\r\nas to take away from her all her presence of mind. Otherwise, she\r\nmust have been aware that such an answer from her would surely drive\r\nher friend\'s wife into open hostility.\r\n\r\n"And why not, Mrs. Marsham?" said Lady Glencora rising from her seat.\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I waltz to-night? I rather think I shall, the more\r\nespecially as Mr. Fitzgerald waltzes very well." Thereupon she put her\r\nhand upon Burgo\'s arm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsham made still a little effort,--a little effort that was\r\nprobably involuntary. She put out her hand, and laid it on Lady\r\nGlencora\'s left shoulder, looking into her face as she did so with\r\nall the severity of caution of which she was mistress. Lady Glencora\r\nshook her duenna off angrily. Whether she would put her fate into\r\nthe hands of this man who was now touching her, or whether she would\r\nnot, she had not as yet decided; but of this she was very sure,\r\nthat nothing said or done by Mrs. Marsham should have any effect in\r\nrestraining her.\r\n\r\nWhat could Mrs. Marsham do? Mr. Palliser was gone. Some rumour of\r\nthat proposed visit to Monkshade, and the way in which it had been\r\nprevented, had reached her ear. Some whispers had come to her that\r\nFitzgerald still dared to love, as married, the woman whom he had\r\nloved before she was married. There was a rumour about that he still\r\nhad some hope. Mrs. Marsham had never believed that Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nwife would really be false to her vows. It was not in fear of any such\r\ncatastrophe as a positive elopement that she had taken upon herself\r\nthe duty of duenna. Lady Glencora would, no doubt, require to be\r\npressed down into that decent mould which it would become the wife\r\nof a Mr. Palliser to assume as her form; and this pressing down, and\r\nthis moulding, Mrs. Marsham thought that she could accomplish. It had\r\nnot hitherto occurred to her that she might be required to guard Mr.\r\nPalliser from positive dishonour; but now--now she hardly knew what\r\nto think about it. What should she do? To whom should she go? And\r\nthen she saw Mr. Bott looming large before her on the top of the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Bott on the watch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lady Glencora went off towards the dancers, leaning\r\non Burgo\'s arm. "Who is that woman?" said Burgo. They were the first\r\nwords he spoke to her, though since he had last seen her he had\r\nwritten to her that letter which even now she carried about her. His\r\nvoice in her ears sounded as it used to sound when their intimacy\r\nhad been close, and questions such as that he had asked were common\r\nbetween them. And her answer was of the same nature. "Oh, such an\r\nodious woman!" she said. "Her name is Mrs. Marsham; she is my bete\r\nnoire." And then they were actually dancing, whirling round the room\r\ntogether, before a word had been said of that which was Burgo\'s\r\nsettled purpose, and which at some moments was her settled purpose\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nBurgo waltzed excellently, and in old days, before her marriage, Lady\r\nGlencora had been passionately fond of dancing. She seemed to give\r\nherself up to it now as though the old days had come back to her.\r\nLady Monk, creeping to the intermediate door between her den and\r\nthe dancing-room, looked in on them, and then crept back again. Mrs.\r\nMarsham and Mr. Bott standing together just inside the other door,\r\nnear to the staircase, looked on also--in horror.\r\n\r\n"He shouldn\'t have gone away and left her," said Mr. Bott, almost\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n"But who could have thought it?" said Mrs. Marsham. "I\'m sure I\r\ndidn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'d better tell him?" said Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know where to find him," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean now at once," said Mr. Bott;--and then he added, "Do\r\nyou think it is as bad as that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to think," said Mrs. Marsham.\r\n\r\nThe waltzers went on till they were stopped by want of breath. "I\r\nam so much out of practice," said Lady Glencora; "I didn\'t think--I\r\nshould have been able--to dance at all." Then she put up her face,\r\nand slightly opened her mouth, and stretched her nostrils,--as ladies\r\ndo as well as horses when the running has been severe and they want\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll take another turn," said he.\r\n\r\n"Presently," said she, beginning to have some thought in her mind\r\nas to whether Mrs. Marsham was watching her. Then there was a little\r\npause, after which he spoke in an altered voice.\r\n\r\n"Does it put you in mind of old days?" said he.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, necessary for him that he should bring her to some\r\nthought of the truth. It was all very sweet, that dancing with her,\r\nas they used to dance, without any question as to the reason why it\r\nwas so; that sudden falling into the old habits, as though everything\r\nbetween this night and the former nights had been a dream; but this\r\nwould not further his views. The opportunity had come to him which\r\nhe must use, if he intended ever to use such opportunity. There was\r\nthe two hundred pounds in his pocket, which he did not intend to give\r\nback. "Does it put you in mind of \'old days?\'" he said.\r\n\r\nThe words roused her from her sleep at once, and dissipated her\r\ndream. The facts all rushed upon her in an instant; the letter in her\r\npocket; the request which she had made to Alice, that Alice might be\r\ninduced to guard her from this danger; the words which her husband\r\nhad spoken to her in the morning, and her anger against him in that\r\nhe had subjected her to the eyes of a Mrs. Marsham; her own unsettled\r\nmind--quite unsettled whether it would be best for her to go or to\r\nstay! It all came upon her now at the first word of tenderness which\r\nBurgo spoke to her.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said of woman that she who doubts is lost,--so\r\noften that they who say it now, say it simply because others have\r\nsaid it before them, never thinking whether or no there be any truth\r\nin the proverb. But they who have said so, thinking of their words as\r\nthey were uttered, have known but little of women. Women doubt every\r\nday, who solve their doubts at last on the right side, driven to\r\ndo so, some by fear, more by conscience, but most of them by that\r\nhalf-prudential, half-unconscious knowledge of what is fitting,\r\nuseful, and best under the cirumstances, which rarely deserts\r\neither men or women till they have brought themselves to the Burgo\r\nFitzgerald state of recklessness. Men when they have fallen even to\r\nthat, will still keep up some outward show towards the world; but\r\nwomen in this condition defy the world, and declare themselves to be\r\nchildren of perdition. Lady Glencora was doubting sorely; but, though\r\ndoubting, she was not as yet lost.\r\n\r\n"Does it put you in mind of old days?" said Burgo.\r\n\r\nShe was driven to answer, and she knew that much would be decided by\r\nthe way in which she might now speak. "You must not talk of that,"\r\nshe said, very softly.\r\n\r\n"May I not?" And now his tongue was unloosed, so that he began to\r\nspeak quickly. "May I not? And why not? They were happy days,--so\r\nhappy! Were not you happy when you thought--? Ah, dear! I suppose it\r\nis best not even to think of them?"\r\n\r\n"Much the best."\r\n\r\n"Only it is impossible. I wish I knew the inside of your heart, Cora,\r\nso that I could see what it is that you really wish."\r\n\r\nIn the old days he had always called her Cora, and now the name\r\ncame from his lips upon her ears as a thing of custom, causing no\r\nsurprise. They were standing back, behind the circle, almost in a\r\ncorner, and Burgo knew well how to speak at such moments so that his\r\nwords should be audible to none but her whom he addressed.\r\n\r\n"You should not have come to me at all," she said.\r\n\r\n"And why not? Who has a better right to come to you? Who has ever\r\nloved you as I have done? Cora, did you get my letter?"\r\n\r\n"Come and dance," she said; "I see a pair of eyes looking at us."\r\nThe pair of eyes which Lady Glencora saw were in the possession of\r\nMr. Bott, who was standing alone, leaning against the side of the\r\ndoorway, every now and then raising his heels from the ground, so\r\nthat he might look down upon the sinners as from a vantage ground.\r\nHe was quite alone. Mrs. Marsham had left him, and had gotten herself\r\naway in Lady Glencora\'s own carriage to Park Lane, in order that she\r\nmight find Mr. Palliser there, if by chance he should be at home.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it be making mischief?" Mrs. Marsham had said when Mr. Bott had\r\nsuggested this line of conduct.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be worse mischief if you don\'t," Mr. Bott had answered. "He\r\ncan come back, and then he can do as he likes. I\'ll keep my eyes upon\r\nthem." And so he did keep his eyes upon them.\r\n\r\nAgain they went round the room,--or that small portion of the room\r\nwhich the invading crowd had left to the dancers,--as though they\r\nwere enjoying themselves thoroughly, and in all innocence. But there\r\nwere others besides Mr. Bott who looked on and wondered. The Duchess\r\nof St. Bungay saw it, and shook her head sorrowing,--for the Duchess\r\nwas good at heart. Mrs. Conway Sparkes saw it, and drank it down with\r\nkeen appetite,--as a thirsty man with a longing for wine will drink\r\nchampagne,--for Mrs. Conway Sparkes was not good at heart. Lady\r\nHartletop saw it, and just raised her eyebrows. It was nothing to\r\nher. She liked to know what was going on, as such knowledge was\r\nsometimes useful; but, as for heart,--what she had was, in such a\r\nmatter, neither good nor bad. Her blood circulated with its ordinary\r\nprecision, and, in that respect, no woman ever had a better heart.\r\nLady Monk saw it, and a frown gathered on her brow. "The fool!" she\r\nsaid to herself. She knew that Burgo would not help his success by\r\ndrawing down the eyes of all her guests upon his attempt. In the\r\nmeantime Mr. Bott stood there, mounting still higher on his toes,\r\nstraightening his back against the wall.\r\n\r\n"Did you get my letter?" Burgo said again, as soon as a moment\'s\r\npause gave him breath to speak. She did not answer him. Perhaps her\r\nbreath did not return to her as rapidly as his. But, of course, he\r\nknew that she had received it. She would have quickly signified to\r\nhim that no letter from him had come to her hands had it not reached\r\nher. "Let us go out upon the stairs," he said, "for I must speak to\r\nyou. Oh, if you could know what I suffered when you did not come to\r\nMonkshade! Why did you not come?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I had not come here," she said.\r\n\r\n"Because you have seen me? That, at any rate, is not kind of you."\r\n\r\nThey were now making their way slowly down the stairs, in the crowd,\r\ntowards the supper-room. All the world was now intent on food and\r\ndrink, and they were only doing as others did. Lady Glencora was not\r\nthinking where she went, but, glancing upwards, as she stood for a\r\nmoment wedged upon the stairs, her eyes met those of Mr. Bott. "A man\r\nthat can treat me like that deserves that I should leave him." That\r\nwas the thought that crossed her mind at the moment.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get you some champagne with water in it," said Burgo. "I know\r\nthat is what you like."\r\n\r\n"Do not get me anything," she said. They had now got into the\r\nroom, and had therefore escaped Mr. Bott\'s eyes for the moment. "Mr.\r\nFitzgerald,"--and now her words had become a whisper in his ear,--"do\r\nwhat I ask you. For the sake of the old days of which you spoke, the\r\ndear old days which can never come again--"\r\n\r\n"By G----! they can," said he. "They can come back, and they shall."\r\n\r\n"Never. But you can still do me a kindness. Go away, and leave me.\r\nGo to the sideboard, and then do not come back. You are doing me an\r\ninjury while you remain with me."\r\n\r\n"Cora," he said,\r\n\r\nBut she had now recovered her presence of mind, and understood what\r\nwas going on. She was no longer in a dream, but words and things\r\nbore to her again their proper meaning. "I will not have it, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald," she answered, speaking almost passionately. "I will not\r\nhave it. Do as I bid you. Go and leave me, and do not return. I tell\r\nyou that we are watched." This was still true, for Mr. Bott had now\r\nagain got his eyes on them, round the supper-room door. Whatever was\r\nthe reward for which he was working, private secretaryship or what\r\nelse, it must be owned that he worked hard for it. But there are\r\nlabours which are labours of love.\r\n\r\n"Who is watching us?" said Burgo; "and what does it matter? If you\r\nare minded to do as I have asked you--"\r\n\r\n"But I am not so minded. Do you not know that you insult me by\r\nproposing it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is an insult, Cora,--unless such an offer be a joy to you.\r\nIf you wish to be my wife instead of his, it is no insult."\r\n\r\n"How can I be that?" Her face was not turned to him, and her words\r\nwere half-pronounced, and in the lowest whisper, but, nevertheless,\r\nhe heard them.\r\n\r\n"Come with me,--abroad, and you shall yet be my wife. You got my\r\nletter? Do what I asked you, then. Come with me--to-night."\r\n\r\nThe pressing instance of the suggestion, the fixing of a present\r\nhour, startled her back to her propriety. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said,\r\n"I asked you to go and leave me. If you do not do so, I must get up\r\nand leave you. It will be much more difficult."\r\n\r\n"And is that to be all?"\r\n\r\n"All;--at any rate, now." Oh, Glencora! how could you be so weak? Why\r\ndid you add that word, "now"? In truth, she added it then, at that\r\nmoment, simply feeling that she could thus best secure an immediate\r\ncompliance with her request.\r\n\r\n"I will not go," he said, looking at her sternly, and leaning before\r\nher, with earnest face, with utter indifference as to the eyes of any\r\nthat might see them. "I will not go till you tell me that you will\r\nsee me again."\r\n\r\n"I will," she said in that low, all-but-unuttered whisper.\r\n\r\n"When,--when,--when?" he asked.\r\n\r\nLooking up again towards the doorway, in fear of Mr. Bott\'s eyes, she\r\nsaw the face of Mr. Palliser as he entered the room. Mr. Bott had also\r\nseen him, and had tried to clutch him by the arm; but Mr. Palliser\r\nhad shaken him off, apparently with indifference,--had got rid of\r\nhim, as it were, without noticing him. Lady Glencora, when she saw\r\nher husband, immediately recovered her courage. She would not cower\r\nbefore him, or show herself ashamed of what she had done. For the\r\nmatter of that, if he pressed her on the subject, she could bring\r\nherself to tell him that she loved Burgo Fitzgerald much more easily\r\nthan she could whisper such a word to Burgo himself. Mr. Bott\'s eyes\r\nwere odious to her as they watched her; but her husband\'s glance\r\nshe could meet without quailing before it. "Here is Mr. Palliser,"\r\nsaid she, speaking again in her ordinary clear-toned voice. Burgo\r\nimmediately rose from his seat with a start, and turned quickly\r\ntowards the door; but Lady Glencora kept her chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser made his way as best he could through the crowd up to\r\nhis wife. He, too, kept his countenance without betraying his secret.\r\nThere was neither anger nor dismay in his face, nor was there any\r\nuntoward hurry in his movement. Burgo stood aside as he came up, and\r\nLady Glencora was the first to speak. "I thought you were gone home\r\nhours ago," she said.\r\n\r\n"I did go home," he answered, "but I thought I might as well come\r\nback for you."\r\n\r\n"What a model of a husband! Well; I am ready. Only, what shall we do\r\nabout Jane? Mr. Fitzgerald, I left a scarf in your aunt\'s room,--a\r\nlittle black and yellow scarf,--would you mind getting it for me?"\r\n\r\n"I will fetch it," said Mr. Palliser; "and I will tell your cousin\r\nthat the carriage shall come back for her."\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me--" said Burgo.\r\n\r\n"I will do it," said Mr. Palliser; and away he went, making his slow\r\nprogress up through the crowd, ordering his carriage as he passed\r\nthrough the hall, and leaving Mr. Bott still watching at the door.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora resolved that she would say nothing to Burgo while her\r\nhusband was gone. There was a touch of chivalry in his leaving them\r\nagain together, which so far conquered her. He might have bade her\r\nleave the scarf, and come at once. She had seen, moreover, that he\r\nhad not spoken to Mr. Bott, and was thankful to him also for that.\r\nBurgo also seemed to have become aware that his chance for that\r\ntime was over. "I will say good-night," he said. "Good-night, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald," she answered, giving him her hand. He pressed it for a\r\nmoment, and then turned and went. When Mr. Palliser came back he was\r\nno more to be seen.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora was at the dining-room door when her husband returned,\r\nstanding close to Mr. Bott. Mr. Bott had spoken to her, but she made\r\nno reply. He spoke again, but her face remained as immovable as though\r\nshe had been deaf. "And what shall we do about Mrs. Marsham?" she\r\nsaid, quite out loud, as soon as she put her hand on her husband\'s\r\narm. "I had forgotten her."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Marsham has gone home," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"When did you see her?"\r\n\r\n"She came to Park Lane."\r\n\r\n"What made her do that?"\r\n\r\nThese questions were asked and answered as he was putting her into\r\nthe carriage. She got in just as she asked the last, and he, as he\r\ntook his seat, did not find it necessary to answer it. But that would\r\nnot serve her turn. "What made Mrs. Marsham go to you at Park Lane\r\nafter she left Lady Monk\'s?" she asked again. Mr. Palliser sat silent,\r\nnot having made up his mind what he would say on the subject. "I\r\nsuppose she went," continued Lady Glencora, "to tell you that I was\r\ndancing with Mr. Fitzgerald. Was that it?"\r\n\r\n"I think, Glencora, we had better not discuss it now."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to discuss it now, or ever. If you did not wish me\r\nto see Mr. Fitzgerald you should not have sent me to Lady Monk\'s.\r\nBut, Plantagenet, I hope you will forgive me if I say that no\r\nconsideration shall induce me to receive again as a guest, in my own\r\nhouse, either Mrs. Marsham or Mr. Bott."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser absolutely declined to say anything on the subject on\r\nthat occasion, and the evening of Lady Monk\'s party in this way came\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nBold Speculations on Murder.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor was not in a very happy mood when he left Queen Anne\r\nStreet, after having flung his gift ring under the grate. Indeed\r\nthere was much in his condition, as connected with the house which\r\nhe was leaving, which could not but make him unhappy. Alice was\r\nengaged to be his wife, and had as yet said nothing to show that she\r\nmeditated any breach of that engagement, but she had treated him in\r\na way which made him long to throw her promise in her teeth. He was\r\na man to whom any personal slight from a woman was unendurable. To\r\nslights from men, unless they were of a nature to provoke offence,\r\nhe was indifferent. There was no man living for whose liking or\r\ndisliking George Vavasor cared anything. But he did care much for the\r\ngood opinion, or rather for the personal favour, of any woman to whom\r\nhe had endeavoured to make himself agreeable. "I will marry you,"\r\nAlice had said to him,--not in words, but in acts and looks, which\r\nwere plainer than words,--"I will marry you for certain reasons of my\r\nown, which in my present condition make it seem that that arrangement\r\nwill be more convenient to me than any other that I can make; but\r\npray understand that there is no love mixed up with this. There is\r\nanother man whom I love;--only, for those reasons above hinted, I\r\ndo not care to marry him." It was thus that he read Alice\'s present\r\ntreatment of him, and he was a man who could not endure this\r\ntreatment with ease.\r\n\r\nBut though he could throw his ring under the grate in his passion, he\r\ncould not so dispose of her. That he would have done so had his hands\r\nbeen free, we need not doubt. And he would have been clever enough\r\nto do so in some manner that would have been exquisitely painful to\r\nAlice, willing as she might be to be released from her engagement.\r\nBut he could not do this to a woman whose money he had borrowed, and\r\nwhose money he could not repay;--to a woman, more of whose money he\r\nintended to borrow immediately. As to that latter part of it, he did\r\nsay to himself over and over again, that he would have no more of\r\nit. As he left the house in Queen Anne Street, on that occasion, he\r\nswore, that under no circumstances would he be indebted to her for\r\nanother shilling. But before he had reached Great Marlborough Street,\r\nto which his steps took him, he had reminded himself that everything\r\ndepended on a further advance. He was in Parliament, but Parliament\r\nwould be dissolved within three months. Having sacrificed so much\r\nfor his position, should he let it all fall from him now,--now, when\r\nsuccess seemed to be within his reach? That wretched old man in\r\nWestmoreland, who seemed gifted almost with immortality,--why could\r\nhe not die and surrender his paltry acres to one who could use them?\r\nHe turned away from Regent Street into Hanover Square before he\r\ncrossed to Great Marlborough Street, giving vent to his passion\r\nrather than arranging his thoughts. As he walked the four sides of\r\nthe square he considered how good it would be if some accident should\r\nbefall the old man. How he would rejoice were he to hear to-morrow\r\nthat one of the trees of the "accursed place," had fallen on the\r\n"obstinate old idiot," and put an end to him! I will not say that he\r\nmeditated the murder of his grandfather. There was a firm conviction\r\non his mind, as he thought of all this, that such a deed as that\r\nwould never come in his way. But he told himself, that if he chose\r\nto make the attempt, he would certainly be able to carry it through\r\nwithout detection. Then he remembered Rush and Palmer--the openly\r\nbold murderer and the secret poisoner. Both of them, in Vavasor\'s\r\nestimation, were great men. He had often said so in company. He had\r\ndeclared that the courage of Rush had never been surpassed. "Think of\r\nhim," he would say with admiration, "walking into a man\'s house, with\r\npistols sufficient to shoot every one there, and doing it as though\r\nhe were killing rats! What was Nelson at Trafalgar to that? Nelson\r\nhad nothing to fear!" And of Palmer he declared that he was a man\r\nof genius as well as courage. He had "looked the whole thing in the\r\nface," Vavasor would say, "and told himself that all scruples and\r\nsqueamishness are bosh,--child\'s tales. And so they are. Who lives\r\nas though they fear either heaven or hell? And if we do live without\r\nsuch fear or respect, what is the use of telling lies to ourselves?\r\nTo throw it all to the dogs, as Palmer did, is more manly." "And\r\nbe hanged," some hearer of George\'s doctrine replied. "Yes, and be\r\nhanged,--if such is your destiny. But you hear of the one who is\r\nhanged, but hear nothing of the twenty who are not."\r\n\r\nVavasor walked round Hanover Square, nursing his hatred against the\r\nold Squire. He did not tell himself that he would like to murder his\r\ngrandfather. But he suggested to himself, that if he desired to do\r\nso, he would have courage enough to make his way into the old man\'s\r\nroom, and strangle him; and he explained to himself how he would be\r\nable to get down into Westmoreland without the world knowing that he\r\nhad been there,--how he would find an entrance into the house by a\r\nwindow with which he was acquainted,--how he could cause the man to\r\ndie as though, those around him should think, it was apoplexy,--he,\r\nGeorge Vavasor, having read something on that subject lately. All\r\nthis he considered very fully, walking rapidly round Hanover Square\r\nmore than once or twice. If he were to become an active student in\r\nthe Rush or Palmer school, he would so study the matter that he would\r\nnot be the one that should be hung. He thought that he could, so far,\r\ntrust his own ingenuity. But yet he did not meditate murder. "Beastly\r\nold idiot!" he said to himself, "he must have his chance as other\r\nmen have, I suppose," And then he went across Regent Street to Mr.\r\nScruby\'s office in Great Marlborough Street, not having, as yet, come\r\nto any positive conclusion as to what he would do in reference to\r\nAlice\'s money.\r\n\r\nBut he soon found himself talking to Mr. Scruby as though there were\r\nno doubts as to the forthcoming funds for the next elections. And\r\nMr. Scruby talked to him very plainly, as though those funds must\r\nbe forthcoming before long. "A stitch in time saves nine," said Mr.\r\nScruby, meaning to insinuate that a pound in time might have the\r\nsame effect. "And I\'ll tell you what, Mr. Vavasor,--of course I\'ve my\r\noutstanding bills for the last affair. That\'s no fault of yours, for\r\nthe things came so sharp one on another that my fellows haven\'t had\r\ntime to make it out. But if you\'ll put me in funds for what I must be\r\nout of pocket in June--"\r\n\r\n"Will it be so soon as June?"\r\n\r\n"They are talking of June. Why, then, I\'ll lump the two bills\r\ntogether when it\'s all over."\r\n\r\nIn their discussion respecting money Mr. Scruby injudiciously\r\nmentioned the name of Mr. Tombe. No precise caution had been given\r\nto him, but he had become aware that the matter was being managed\r\nthrough an agency that was not recognized by his client; and as that\r\nagency was simply a vehicle of money which found its way into Mr.\r\nScruby\'s pocket, he should have held his tongue. But Mr. Tombe\'s name\r\nescaped from him, and Vavasor immediately questioned him. Scruby, who\r\ndid not often make such blunders, readily excused himself, shaking\r\nhis head, and declaring that the name had fallen from his lips\r\ninstead of that of another man. Vavasor accepted the excuse without\r\nfurther notice, and nothing more was said about Mr. Tombe while he\r\nwas in Mr. Scruby\'s office. But he had not heard the name in vain,\r\nand had unfortunately heard it before. Mr. Tombe was a remarkable\r\nman in his way. He wore powder to his hair,--was very polite in his\r\nbearing,--was somewhat asthmatic, and wheezed in his talking,--and\r\nwas, moreover, the most obedient of men, though it was said of him\r\nthat he managed the whole income of the Ely Chapter just as he\r\npleased. Being in these ways a man of note, John Grey had spoken of\r\nhim to Alice, and his name had filtered through Alice and her cousin\r\nKate to George Vavasor. George seldom forgot things or names, and\r\nwhen he heard Mr. Tombe\'s name mentioned in connection with his own\r\nmoney matters, he remembered that Mr. Tombe was John Grey\'s lawyer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could escape out into the street he endeavoured to put\r\nall these things together, and after a while resolved that he would\r\ngo to Mr. Tombe. What if there should be an understanding between John\r\nGrey and Alice, and Mr. Tombe should be arranging his money matters\r\nfor him! Would not anything be better than this,--even that little\r\ntragedy down in Westmoreland, for which his ingenuity and courage\r\nwould be required? He could endure to borrow money from Alice. He\r\nmight even endure it still,--though that was very difficult after\r\nher treatment of him; but he could not endure to be the recipient of\r\nJohn Grey\'s money. By heavens, no! And as he got into a cab, and had\r\nhimself driven off to the neighbourhood of Doctors\' Commons, he gave\r\nhimself credit for much fine manly feeling. Mr. Tombe\'s chambers were\r\nfound without difficulty, and, as it happened, Mr. Tombe was there.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer rose from his chair as Vavasor entered, and bowed his\r\npowdered head very meekly as he asked his visitor to sit down. "Mr.\r\nVavasor;--oh, yes. He had heard the name. Yes; he was in the habit of\r\nacting for his very old friend Mr. John Grey. He had acted for Mr. John\r\nGrey, and for Mr. John Grey\'s father,--he or his partner,--he believed\r\nhe might say, for about half a century. There could not be a nicer\r\ngentleman than Mr. John Grey;--and such a pretty child as he used to\r\nbe!" At every new sentence Mr. Tombe caught his poor asthmatic breath,\r\nand bowed his meek old head, and rubbed his hands together as though\r\nhe hardly dared to keep his seat in Vavasor\'s presence without the\r\nsupport of some such motion; and wheezed apologetically, and seemed\r\nto ask pardon of his visitor for not knowing intuitively what was the\r\nnature of that visitor\'s business. But he was a sly old fox was Mr.\r\nTombe, and was considering all this time how much it would be well\r\nthat he should tell Mr. Vavasor, and how much it would be well that he\r\nshould conceal. "The fat had got into the fire," as he told his old\r\nwife when he got home that evening. He told his old wife everything,\r\nand I don\'t know that any of his clients were the worse for his doing\r\nso. But while he was wheezing, and coughing, and apologizing, he made\r\nup his mind that if George Vavasor were to ask him certain questions,\r\nit would be best that he should answer them truly. If Vavasor did ask\r\nthose questions, he would probably do so upon certain knowledge, and\r\nif so, why, in that case, lying would be of no use. Lying would not\r\nput the fat back into the frying pan. And even though such questions\r\nmight be asked without any absolute knowledge, they would, at any\r\nrate, show that the questioner had the means of ascertaining the\r\ntruth. He would tell as little as he could; but he decided during his\r\nlast wheeze, that he could not lie in the matter with any chance of\r\nbenefiting his client. "The prettiest child I ever saw, Mr. Vavasor!"\r\nsaid Mr. Tombe, and then he coughed violently. Some people who knew\r\nMr. Tombe declared that he nursed his cough.\r\n\r\n"I dare say," said George.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed,--ugh--ugh--ugh."\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me, Mr. Tombe, whether either you or he have anything to\r\ndo with the payment of certain sums to my credit at Messrs. Hock and\r\nBlock\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Messrs. Hock and Block\'s, the bankers,--in Lom--bard Street?" said Mr.\r\nTombe, taking a little more time.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I bank there," said Vavasor, sharply.\r\n\r\n"A most respectable house."\r\n\r\n"Has any money been paid there to my credit, by you, Mr. Tombe?"\r\n\r\n"May I ask you why you put the question to me, Mr. Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think you may. That is to say, my reason for asking it\r\ncan have nothing to do with yours for replying to it. If you have had\r\nno hand in any such payment, there is an end of it, and I need not\r\ntake up your time by saying anything more on the subject."\r\n\r\n"I am not prepared to go that length, Mr. Vavasor,--not altogether to\r\ngo that length,--ugh--ugh--ugh."\r\n\r\n"Then, will you tell me what you have done in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--upon my word, you\'ve taken me a little by surprise. Let me\r\nsee. Pinkle,--Pinkle." Pinkle was a clerk who sat in an inner room,\r\nand Mr. Tombe\'s effort to call him seemed to be most ineffectual. But\r\nPinkle understood the sound, and came. "Pinkle, didn\'t we pay some\r\nmoney into Hock and Block\'s a few weeks since, to the credit of Mr.\r\nGeorge Vavasor?"\r\n\r\n"Did we, sir?" said Pinkle, who probably knew that his employer was\r\nan old fox, and who, perhaps, had caught something of the fox nature\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"I think we did. Just look Pinkle;--and, Pinkle,--see the date, and\r\nlet me know all about it. It\'s fine bright weather for this time of\r\nyear, Mr. Vavasor; but these easterly winds!--ugh--ugh--ugh!"\r\n\r\nVavasor found himself sitting for an apparently interminable number\r\nof minutes in Mr. Tombe\'s dingy chamber, and was coughed at, and\r\nwheezed at, till he begun to be tired of his position; moreover, when\r\ntired, he showed his impatience. "Perhaps you\'ll let us write you a\r\nline when we have looked into the matter?" suggested Mr. Tombe.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather know at once," said Vavasor. "I don\'t suppose it can take\r\nyou very long to find out whether you have paid money to my account,\r\nby order of Mr. Grey. At any rate, I must know before I go away."\r\n\r\n"Pinkle, Pinkle!" screamed the old man through his coughing; and\r\nagain Pinkle came. "Well, Pinkle, was anything of the kind done, or\r\nis my memory deceiving me?" Mr. Tombe was, no doubt, lying shamefully,\r\nfor, of course, he remembered all about it; and, indeed, George\r\nVavasor had learned already quite enough for his own purposes.\r\n\r\n"I was going to look," said Pinkle; and Pinkle again went away.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to give your clerk so much trouble," said Vavasor, in an\r\nangry voice; "and I think it must be unnecessary. Surely you know\r\nwhether Mr. Grey has commissioned you to pay money for me?"\r\n\r\n"We have so many things to do, Mr. Vavasor; and so many clients. We\r\nhave, indeed. You see, it isn\'t only one gentleman\'s affairs. But I\r\nthink there was something done. I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"What is Mr. John Grey\'s address?" asked Vavasor, very sharply.\r\n\r\n"Number 5, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall East," said Mr. Tombe. Herein\r\nMr. Tombe somewhat committed himself. His client, Mr. Grey, was, in\r\nfact, in town, but Vavasor had not known or imagined that such was\r\nthe case. Had Mr. Tombe given the usual address of Nethercoats, nothing\r\nfurther would have been demanded from him on that subject. But he\r\nhad foolishly presumed that the question had been based on special\r\ninformation as to his client\'s visit to London, and he had told the\r\nplain truth in a very simple way.\r\n\r\n"Number 5, Suffolk Street," said Vavasor, writing down the address.\r\n"Perhaps it will be better that I should go to him, as you do not\r\nseem inclined to give me any information." Then he took up his hat,\r\nand hardly bowing to Mr. Tombe, left the chambers. Mr. Tombe, as he\r\ndid so, rose from his chair, and bent his head meekly down upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Pinkle, Pinkle," wheezed Mr. Tombe. "Never mind; never mind." Pinkle\r\ndidn\'t mind; and we may say that he had not minded; for up to that\r\nmoment he had taken no steps towards a performance of the order which\r\nhad been given him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nWhat Occurred in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Tombe had gained nothing for the cause by his crafty silence.\r\nGeorge Vavasor felt perfectly certain, as he walked out from the\r\nlittle street which runs at the back of Doctors\' Commons, that the\r\nmoney which he had been using had come, in some shape, through the\r\nhands of John Grey. He did not care much to calculate whether the\r\npayments had been made from the personal funds of his rival, or\r\nwhether that rival had been employed to dispense Alice\'s fortune.\r\nUnder either view of the case his position was sufficiently bitter.\r\nThe truth never for a moment occurred to him. He never dreamed that\r\nthere might be a conspiracy in the matter, of which Alice was as\r\nignorant as he himself had been. He never reflected that his uncle\r\nJohn, together with John, the lover, whom he so hated, might be the\r\nconspirators. To him it seemed to be certain that Alice and Mr. Grey\r\nwere in league;--and if they were in league, what must he think of\r\nAlice, and of her engagement with himself!\r\n\r\nThere are men who rarely think well of women,--who hardly think\r\nwell of any woman. They put their mothers and sisters into the\r\nbackground,--as though they belonged to some sex or race apart,--and\r\nthen declare to themselves and to their friends that all women are\r\nfalse,--that no woman can be trusted unless her ugliness protect\r\nher; and that every woman may be attacked as fairly as may game in\r\na cover, or deer on a mountain, What man does not know men who have\r\nso thought? I cannot say that such had been Vavasor\'s creed,--not\r\nentirely such. There had been periods of his life when he had\r\nbelieved implicitly in his cousin Alice;--but then there had been\r\nother moments in which he had ridiculed himself for his Quixotism\r\nin believing in any woman. And as he had grown older the moments of\r\nhis Quixotism had become more rare. There would have been no such\r\nQuixotism left with him now, had not the various circumstances which\r\nI have attempted to describe, filled him, during the last twelve\r\nmonths, with a renewed desire to marry his cousin. Every man tries to\r\nbelieve in the honesty of his future wife; and, therefore, Vavasor\r\nhad tried, and had in his way, believed. He had flattered himself,\r\ntoo, that Alice\'s heart had, in truth, been more prone to him than to\r\nthat other suitor. Grey, as he thought, had been accepted by her cold\r\nprudence; but he thought, also, that she had found her prudence to\r\nbe too cold, and had therefore returned where she had truly loved.\r\nVavasor, though he did not love much himself, was willing enough to\r\nbe the object of love.\r\n\r\nThis idea of his, however, had been greatly shaken by Alice\'s\r\ntreatment of himself personally; but still he had not, hitherto,\r\nbelieved that she was false to him. Now, what could he believe of\r\nher? What was there within the compass of such a one to believe?\r\nAs he walked out into St. Paul\'s Churchyard he called her by every\r\nname which is most offensive to a woman\'s ears. He hated her at this\r\nmoment with even a more bitter hatred than that which he felt towards\r\nJohn Grey. She must have deceived him with unparalleled hypocrisy,\r\nand lied to him and to his sister Kate as hardly any woman had ever\r\nlied before. Or could it be that Kate, also, was lying to him? If so,\r\nKate also should be included in the punishment.\r\n\r\nBut why should they have conspired to feed him with these moneys?\r\nThere had been no deceit, at any rate, in reference to the pounds\r\nsterling which Scruby had already swallowed. They had been supplied,\r\nwhatever had been the motives of the suppliers; and he had no doubt\r\nthat more would be supplied if he would only keep himself quiet. He\r\nwas still walking westward as he thought of this, down Ludgate Hill,\r\non his direct line towards Suffolk Street; and he tried to persuade\r\nhimself that it would be well that he should hide his wrath till\r\nafter provision should have been made for this other election. They\r\nwere his enemies,--Alice and Mr. Grey,--and why should he keep any\r\nterms with his enemies? It was still a trouble to him to think\r\nthat he should have been in any way beholden to John Grey; but the\r\nterrible thing had been done, the evil had occurred. What would he\r\ngain by staying his hand now? Still, however, he walked on quickly\r\nalong Fleet Street, and along the Strand, and was already crossing\r\nunder the Picture Galleries towards Pall Mall East before he had\r\ndefinitely decided what steps he would take on this very day. Exactly\r\nat the corner of Suffolk Street he met John Grey.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Grey," he said, stopping himself suddenly, "I was this moment\r\ngoing to call on you at your lodgings."\r\n\r\n"At my lodgings, were you? Shall I return with you?"\r\n\r\n"If you please," said Vavasor, leading the way up Suffolk Street.\r\nThere had been no other greeting than this between them. Mr. Grey\r\nhimself, though a man very courteous in his general demeanour, would\r\nprobably have passed Vavasor in the street with no more than the\r\nbarest salutation. Situated as they were towards each other there\r\ncould hardly be any show of friendship between them; but when Vavasor\r\nhad spoken to him, he had dressed his face in that guise of civility\r\nwhich men always use who do not intend to be offensive;--but Vavasor\r\ndressed his as men dress theirs who do mean to be offensive; and Mr.\r\nGrey had thoroughly appreciated the dressing.\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me, I have the key," said Grey. Then they both\r\nentered the house, and Vavasor followed his host up-stairs. Mr. Grey,\r\nas he went up, felt almost angry with himself in having admitted his\r\nenemy into his lodgings. He was sure that no good could come of it,\r\nand remembered, when it was too late, that he might easily have saved\r\nhimself from giving the invitation while he was still in the street.\r\nThere they were, however, together in the sitting-room, and Grey had\r\nnothing to do but to listen. "Will you take a chair, Mr. Vavasor?" he\r\nsaid. "No," said Vavasor; "I will stand up." And he stood up, holding\r\nhis hat behind his back with his left hand, with his right leg\r\nforward, and the thumb of his right hand in his waistcoat-pocket. He\r\nlooked full into Grey\'s face, and Grey looked full into his; and as\r\nhe looked the great cicatrice seemed to open itself and to become\r\npurple with fresh blood stains.\r\n\r\n"I have come here from Mr. Tombe\'s office in the City," said Vavasor,\r\n"to ask you of what nature has been the interference which you have\r\ntaken in my money matters?"\r\n\r\nThis was a question which Mr. Grey could not answer very quickly. In\r\nthe first place it was altogether unexpected; in the next place he\r\ndid not know what Mr. Tombe had told, and what he had not told; and\r\nthen, before he replied, he must think how much of the truth he was\r\nbound to tell in answer to a question so put to him.\r\n\r\n"Do you say that you have come from Mr. Tombe?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I think you heard me say so. I have come here direct from Mr. Tombe\'s\r\nchambers. He is your lawyer, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"He is so."\r\n\r\n"And I have come from him to ask you what interference you have\r\nlately taken in my money matters. When you have answered that, I\r\nshall have other questions to ask you."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Vavasor, has it occurred to you that I may not be disposed\r\nto answer questions so asked?"\r\n\r\n"It has not occurred to me to think that you will prevaricate. If\r\nthere has been no such interference, I will ask your pardon, and go\r\naway; but if there has been such interference on your part, I have a\r\nright to demand that you shall explain to me its nature."\r\n\r\nGrey had now made up his mind that it would be better that he should\r\ntell the whole story,--better not only for himself, but for all the\r\nVavasors, including this angry man himself. The angry man evidently\r\nknew something, and it would be better that he should know the truth.\r\n"There has been such interference, Mr. Vavasor, if you choose to call\r\nit so. Money, to the extent of two thousand pounds, I think, has by\r\nmy directions been paid to your credit by Mr. Tombe."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Vavasor, taking his right hand away from his waistcoat,\r\nand tapping the round table with his fingers impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to explain all the circumstances under which this\r\nhas been done."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not; but, nevertheless, you must explain them."\r\n\r\nGrey was a man tranquil in temperament, very little prone to\r\nquarrelling, with perhaps an exaggerated idea of the evil results\r\nof a row,--a man who would take infinite trouble to avoid any such\r\nscene as that which now seemed to be imminent; but he was a man whose\r\ncourage was quite as high as that of his opponent. To bully or be\r\nbullied were alike contrary to his nature. It was clear enough now\r\nthat Vavasor intended to bully him, and he made up his mind at once\r\nthat if the quarrel were forced upon him it should find him ready\r\nto take his own part. "My difficulty in explaining it comes from\r\nconsideration for you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Then I beg that your difficulty will cease, and that you will have\r\nno consideration for me. We are so circumstanced towards each other\r\nthat any consideration must be humbug and nonsense. At any rate, I\r\nintend to have none for you. Now, let me know why you have meddled\r\nwith my matters."\r\n\r\n"I think I might, perhaps, better refer you to your uncle."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; Mr. Tombe is not my uncle\'s lawyer. My uncle never heard his\r\nname, unless he heard of it from you."\r\n\r\n"But it was by agreement with your uncle that I commissioned Mr. Tombe\r\nto raise for you the money you were desirous of borrowing from your\r\ncousin. We thought it better that her fortune should not be for the\r\nmoment disturbed."\r\n\r\n"But what had you to do with it? Why should you have done it? In the\r\nfirst place, I don\'t believe your story; it is altogether improbable.\r\nBut why should he come to you of all men to raise money on his\r\ndaughter\'s behalf?"\r\n\r\n"Unless you can behave yourself with more discretion, Mr. Vavasor, you\r\nmust leave the room," said Mr. Grey. Then, as Vavasor simply sneered\r\nat him, but spoke nothing, he went on. "It was I who suggested to\r\nyour uncle that this arrangement should be made. I did not wish to\r\nsee Miss Vavasor\'s fortune squandered."\r\n\r\n"And what was her fortune to you, sir? Are you aware that she is\r\nengaged to me as my wife? I ask you, sir, whether you are aware that\r\nMiss Vavasor is to be my wife?"\r\n\r\n"I must altogether decline to discuss with you Miss Vavasor\'s present\r\nor future position."\r\n\r\n"By heavens, then, you shall hear me discuss it! She was engaged to\r\nyou, and she has given you your dismissal. If you had understood\r\nanything of the conduct which is usual among gentlemen, or if you\r\nhad had any particle of pride in you, sir, you would have left her\r\nand never mentioned her name again. I now find you meddling with her\r\nmoney matters, so as to get a hold upon her fortune."\r\n\r\n"I have no hold upon her fortune."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, you have. You do not advance two thousand pounds without\r\nknowing that you have security. She has rejected you; and in order\r\nthat you may be revenged, or that you may have some further hold\r\nupon her,--that she may be in some sort within your power, you have\r\ncontrived this rascally pettifogging way of obtaining power over her\r\nincome. The money shall be repaid at once, with any interest that can\r\nbe due; and if I find you interfering again, I will expose you."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vavasor," said Grey very slowly, in a low tone of voice, but with\r\nsomething in his eye which would have told any bystander that he was\r\nmuch in earnest, "you have used words in your anger which I cannot\r\nallow to pass. You must recall them."\r\n\r\n"What were the words? I said that you were a pettifogging rascal. I\r\nnow repeat them." As he spoke he put on his hat, so as to leave both\r\nhis hands ready for action if action should be required.\r\n\r\nGrey was much the larger man and much the stronger. It may be doubted\r\nwhether he knew himself the extent of his own strength, but such as\r\nit was he resolved that he must now use it. "There is no help for\r\nit," he said, as he also prepared for action. The first thing he did\r\nwas to open the door, and as he did so he became conscious that his\r\nmouth was full of blood from a sharp blow upon his face. Vavasor\r\nhad struck him with his fist, and had cut his lip against his teeth.\r\nThen there came a scramble, and Grey was soon aware that he had his\r\nopponent in his hands. I doubt whether he had attempted to strike a\r\nblow, or whether he had so much as clenched his fist. Vavasor had\r\nstruck him repeatedly, but the blows had fallen on his body or his\r\nhead, and he was unconscious of them. He had but one object now in\r\nhis mind, and that object was the kicking his assailant down the\r\nstairs. Then came a scramble, as I have said, and Grey had a hold of\r\nthe smaller man by the nape of his neck. So holding him he forced\r\nhim back through the door on to the landing, and there succeeded in\r\npushing him down the first flight of steps. Grey kicked at him as\r\nhe went, but the kick was impotent. He had, however, been so far\r\nsuccessful that he had thrust his enemy out of the room, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing him sprawling on the landing-place.\r\n\r\nVavasor, when he raised himself, prepared to make another rush at\r\nthe room, but before he could do so a man from below, hearing the\r\nnoise, had come upon him and interrupted him. "Mr. Jones," said Grey,\r\nspeaking from above, "if that gentleman does not leave the house, I\r\nmust get you to search for a policeman."\r\n\r\nVavasor, though the lodging-house man had hold of the collar of his\r\ncoat, made no attempt to turn upon his new enemy. When two dogs are\r\nfighting, any bystander may attempt to separate them with impunity.\r\nThe brutes are so anxious to tear each other that they have no\r\nenergies left for other purposes. It never occurs to them to turn\r\ntheir teeth upon newcomers in the quarrel. So it was with George\r\nVavasor. Jones was sufficient to prevent his further attack upon the\r\nfoe up-stairs, and therefore he had no alternative but to relinquish\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it all about, sir?" said Jones, who kept a tailor\'s\r\nestablishment, and, as a tailor, was something of a fighting man\r\nhimself. Of all tradesmen in London the tailors are, no doubt, the\r\nmost combative,--as might be expected from the necessity which lies\r\nupon them of living down the general bad character in this respect\r\nwhich the world has wrongly given them. "What\'s it all about, sir?"\r\nsaid Jones, still holding Vavasor by his coat.\r\n\r\n"That man has ill-used me, and I\'ve punished him; that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about punishing," said the tailor. "It seems to me\r\nhe pitched you down pretty clean out of the room above. I think the\r\nbest thing you can do now is to walk yourself off."\r\n\r\nIt was the only thing that Vavasor could do, and he did walk himself\r\noff. He walked himself off, and went home to his own lodgings in\r\nCecil Street, that he might smooth his feathers after the late\r\nencounter before he went down to Westminster to take his seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons. I do not think that he was comfortable when he got\r\nthere, or that he felt himself very well able to fight another battle\r\nthat night on behalf of the River Bank. He had not been hurt, but he\r\nhad been worsted. Grey had probably received more personal damage\r\nthan had fallen to his share; but Grey had succeeded in expelling him\r\nfrom the room, and he knew that he had been found prostrate on the\r\nlanding-place when the tailor first saw him.\r\n\r\nBut he might probably have got over the annoyance of this feeling\r\nhad he not been overwhelmed by a consciousness that everything was\r\ngoing badly with him. He was already beginning to hate his seat in\r\nParliament. What good had it done for him, or was it likely to do\r\nfor him? He found himself to be associated there with Mr. Bott, and\r\na few others of the same class,--men whom he despised; and even they\r\ndid not admit him among them without a certain show of superiority\r\non their part. Who has not ascertained by his own experience the\r\ndifferent lights through which the same events may be seen, according\r\nto the success, or want of success, which pervades the atmosphere\r\nat the moment? At the present time everything was unsuccessful with\r\nGeorge Vavasor; and though he told himself, almost from hour to hour,\r\nthat he would go on with the thing which he had begun,--that he would\r\npersevere in Parliament till he had obtained a hearing there and\r\ncreated for himself success, he could not himself believe in the\r\npromises which he had made to himself. He had looked forward to his\r\nentrance into that Chamber as the hour of his triumph; but he had\r\nentered it with Mr. Bott, and there had been no triumph to him in\r\ndoing so. He had sworn to himself that when there he would find men\r\nto hear him. Hitherto, indeed, he could not accuse himself of having\r\nmissed his opportunities; his election had been so recent that he\r\ncould hardly yet have made the attempt. But he had been there long\r\nenough to learn to fancy that there was no glory in attempting. This\r\nart of speaking in Parliament, which had appeared to him to be so\r\ngrand, seemed already to be a humdrum, homely, dull affair. No one\r\nseemed to listen much to what was said. To such as himself,--Members\r\nwithout an acquired name,--men did not seem to listen at all. Mr.\r\nPalliser had once, in his hearing, spoken for two hours together, and\r\nall the House had treated his speech with respect,--had declared that\r\nit was useful, solid, conscientious, and what not; but more than half\r\nthe House had been asleep more than half the time that he was on his\r\nlegs. Vavasor had not as yet commenced his career as an orator; but\r\nnight after night, as he sat there, the chance of commencing it with\r\nbrilliance seemed to be further from him, and still further. Two\r\nthousand pounds of his own money, and two thousand more of Alice\'s\r\nmoney,--or of Mr. Grey\'s,--he had already spent to make his way into\r\nthat assembly. He must spend, at any rate, two thousand more if he\r\nintended that his career should be prolonged beyond a three months\'\r\nsitting;--and how was he to get this further sum after what had taken\r\nplace to-day?\r\n\r\nHe would get it. That was his resolve as he walked in by the\r\napple-woman\'s stall, under the shadow of the great policeman, and\r\nbetween the two august lamps. He would get it;--as long as Alice had\r\na pound over which he could obtain mastery by any act or violence\r\nwithin his compass. He would get it; even though it should come\r\nthrough the hands of John Grey and Mr. Tombe. He would get it; though\r\nin doing so he might destroy his cousin Alice and ruin his sister\r\nKate. He had gone too far to stick at any scruples. Had he not often\r\ndeclared how great had been that murderer who had been able to divest\r\nhimself of all such scruples,--who had scoured his bosom free from\r\nall fears of the hereafter, and, as regarded the present, had dared\r\nto trust for everything to success? He would go to Alice and demand\r\nthe money from her with threats, and with that violence in his eyes\r\nwhich he knew so well how to assume. He believed that when he so\r\ndemanded it, the money would be forthcoming so as to satisfy, at any\r\nrate, his present emergencies.\r\n\r\nThat wretched old man in Westmoreland! If he would but die, there\r\nmight yet be a hope remaining of permanent success! Even though\r\nthe estate might be entailed so as to give him no more than a\r\nlife-interest, still money might be raised on it. His life-interest\r\nin it would be worth ten or twelve years\' purchase. He had an idea\r\nthat his grandfather had not as yet made any such will when he left\r\nthe place in Westmoreland. What a boon it would be if death could be\r\nmade to overtake the old man before he did so! On this very night he\r\nwalked about the lobbies of the House, thinking of all this. He went\r\nby himself from room to room, roaming along passages, sitting now for\r\nten minutes in the gallery, and then again for a short space in the\r\nbody of the House,--till he would get up and wander again out into\r\nthe lobby, impatient of the neighbourhood of Mr. Bott. Certainly just\r\nat this time he felt no desire to bring before the House the subject\r\nof the River Embankment.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Grey much happier when he was left alone, than was his\r\nassailant. To give Vavasor his due, the memory of the affray itself\r\ndid not long trouble him much. The success between the combatants had\r\nbeen nearly equal, and he had, at any rate, spoken his mind freely.\r\nHis misery had come from other sources. But the reflection that he\r\nhad been concerned in a row was in itself enough to make John Grey\r\nwretched for the time. Such a misfortune had never hitherto befallen\r\nhim. In all his dealings with men words had been sufficient, and\r\ngenerally words of courtesy had sufficed. To have been personally\r\nengaged in a fighting scramble with such a man as George Vavasor was\r\nto him terrible. When ordering that his money might be expended with\r\nthe possible object of saving Alice from her cousin, he had never\r\nfelt a moment\'s regret; he had never thought that he was doing more\r\nthan circumstances fairly demanded of him. But now he was almost\r\ndriven to utter reproach. "Oh, Alice! that this thing should have\r\ncome upon me through thy fault!"\r\n\r\nWhen Vavasor was led away down stairs by the tailor, and Grey found\r\nthat no more actual fighting would be required of him, he retired\r\ninto his bedroom, that he might wash his mouth and free himself from\r\nthe stains of the combat. He had heard the front door closed, and\r\nknew that the miscreant was gone,--the miscreant who had disturbed\r\nhis quiet. Then he began to think what was the accusation with which\r\nVavasor had charged him. He had been told that he had advanced\r\nmoney on behalf of Alice, in order that he might obtain some power\r\nover Alice\'s fortune, and thus revenge himself upon Alice for her\r\ntreatment of him. Nothing could be more damnably false than this\r\naccusation. Of that he was well aware. But were not the circumstances\r\nof a nature to make it appear that the accusation was true? Security\r\nfor the money advanced by him, of course, he had none;--of course\r\nhe had desired none;--of course the money had been given out of his\r\nown pocket with the sole object of saving Alice, if that might be\r\npossible; but of all those who might hear of this affair, how many\r\nwould know or even guess the truth?\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this wretched state of mind, washing his mouth, and\r\ndisturbing his spirit, Mr. Jones, his landlord, came up to him. Mr.\r\nJones had known him for some years, and entertained a most profound\r\nrespect for his character. A rather sporting man than otherwise was\r\nMr. Jones. His father had been a tradesman at Cambridge, and in this\r\nway Jones had become known to Mr. Grey. But though given to sport,\r\nby which he meant modern prize-fighting and the Epsom course on the\r\nDerby day, Mr. Jones was a man who dearly loved respectable customers\r\nand respectable lodgers. Mr. Grey, with his property at Nethercoats,\r\nand his august manners, and his reputation at Cambridge, was a most\r\nrespectable lodger, and Mr. Jones could hardly understand how any one\r\ncould presume to raise his hand against such a man.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, sir--this is a terrible affair!" he said, as he made his\r\nway into the room.\r\n\r\n"It was very disagreeable, certainly," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"Was the gentleman known to you?" asked the tailor.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know who he is."\r\n\r\n"Any quarrel, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes. I should not have pushed him down stairs had he not\r\nquarrelled with me."\r\n\r\n"We can have the police after him if you wish it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish it at all."\r\n\r\n"Or we might manage to polish him off in any other way, you know."\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Mr. Grey could get rid of the tailor, but he\r\ndid so at last without having told any part of the story to that\r\nwarlike, worthy, and very anxious individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nThe Last Will of the Old Squire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Kate Vavasor was living down in Westmoreland, with no\r\nother society than that of her grandfather, and did not altogether\r\nhave a very pleasant life of it. George had been apt to represent the\r\nold man to himself as being as strong as an old tower, which, though\r\nit be but a ruin, shows no sign of falling. To his eyes the Squire\r\nhad always seemed to be full of life and power. He could be violent\r\non occasions, and was hardly ever without violence in his eyes and\r\nvoice. But George\'s opinion was formed by his wish, or rather by\r\nthe reverses of his wish. For years he had been longing that his\r\ngrandfather should die,--had been accusing Fate of gross injustice in\r\nthat she did not snap the thread; and with such thoughts in his mind\r\nhe had grudged every ounce which the Squire\'s vigour had been able to\r\nsustain. He had almost taught himself to believe that it would be a\r\ngood deed to squeeze what remained of life out of that violent old\r\nthroat. But, indeed, the embers of life were burning low; and had\r\nGeorge known all the truth, he would hardly have inclined his mind to\r\nthoughts of murder.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, very weak with age, and tottering with unsteady steps\r\non the brink of his grave, though he would still come down early from\r\nhis room, and would, if possible, creep out about the garden and into\r\nthe farmyard. He would still sit down to dinner, and would drink his\r\nallotted portion of port wine, in the doctor\'s teeth. The doctor by\r\nno means desired to rob him of his last luxury, or even to stint\r\nhis quantity; but he recommended certain changes in the mode and\r\ntime of taking it. Against this, however, the old Squire indignantly\r\nrebelled, and scolded Kate almost off her legs when she attempted\r\nto enforce the doctor\'s orders. "What the mischief does it signify,"\r\nthe old man said to her one evening;--"what difference will it make\r\nwhether I am dead or alive, unless it is that George would turn you\r\nout of the house directly he gets it."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of any one but yourself, sir," said Kate, with a\r\ntear in her eye.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be troubled to think of me much longer," said the Squire;\r\nand then he gulped down the remaining half of his glass of wine.\r\n\r\nKate was, in truth, very good to him. Women always are good under\r\nsuch circumstances; and Kate Vavasor was one who would certainly\r\nstick to such duties as now fell to her lot. She was eminently true\r\nand loyal to her friends, though she could be as false on their\r\nbehalf as most false people can be on their own. She was very good\r\nto the old man, tending all his wants, taking his violence with\r\ngood-humour rather than with submission, not opposing him with direct\r\ncontradiction when he abused his grandson, but saying little words\r\nto mitigate his wrath, if it were possible. At such times the Squire\r\nwould tell her that she also would learn to know her brother\'s\r\ncharacter some day. "You\'ll live to be robbed by him, and turned out\r\nas naked as you were born," he said to her one day. Then Kate fired\r\nup and declared that she fully trusted her brother\'s love. Whatever\r\nfaults he might have, he had been staunch to her, So she said, and\r\nthe old man sneered at her for saying so.\r\n\r\nOne morning, soon after this, when she brought him up to his bedroom\r\nsome mixture of thin porridge, which he still endeavoured to swallow\r\nfor his breakfast, he bade her sit down, and began to talk to her\r\nabout the property. "I know you are a fool," he said, "about all\r\nmatters of business;--more of a fool than even women generally are."\r\nTo this Kate acceded with a little smile,--acknowledging that her\r\nunderstanding was limited. "I want to see Gogram," he said. "Do you\r\nwrite to him a line, telling him to come here to-day,--he or one of\r\nhis men,--and send it at once by Peter." Gogram was an attorney who\r\nlived at Penrith, and who was never summoned to Vavasor Hall unless\r\nthe Squire had something to say about his will. "Don\'t you think\r\nyou\'d better put it off till you are a little stronger?" said Kate.\r\nWhereupon the Squire fired at her such a volley of oaths that she\r\nsprang off the chair on which she was sitting, and darted across to a\r\nlittle table at which there was pen and ink, and wrote her note to Mr.\r\nGogram, before she had recovered from the shaking which the battery\r\nhad given her. She wrote the note, and ran away with it to Peter,\r\nand saw Peter on the pony on his way to Penrith, before she dared to\r\nreturn to her grandfather\'s bedside.\r\n\r\n"What should you do with the estate if I left it you?" the Squire\r\nsaid to her the first moment she was again back with him.\r\n\r\nThis was a question she could not answer instantly. She stood by\r\nhis bedside for a while thinking,--holding her grandfather\'s hand\r\nand looking down upon the bed. He, with his rough watery old eyes,\r\nwas gazing up into her face, as though he were trying to read her\r\nthoughts. "I think I should give it to my brother," she said.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m d---- if I\'ll leave it to you," said he.\r\n\r\nShe did not jump now, though he had sworn at her. She still stood,\r\nholding his hand softly, and looking down upon the bed. "If I were\r\nyou, grandfather," she said almost in a whisper, "I would not trust\r\nmyself to alter family arrangements whilst I was ill. I\'m sure you\r\nwould advise any one else against doing so."\r\n\r\n"And if I were to leave it to Alice, she\'d give it to him too," he\r\nsaid, speaking his thoughts out loud. "What it is you see in him, I\r\nnever could even guess. He\'s as ugly as a baboon, with his scarred\r\nface. He has never done anything to show himself a clever fellow.\r\nKate, give me some of that bottle the man sent." Kate handed him his\r\nmedicine, and then stood again by his bedside.\r\n\r\n"Where did he get the money to pay for his election?" the Squire\r\nasked, as soon as he had swallowed the draught. "They wouldn\'t give\r\nsuch a one as him credit a yard further than they could see him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where he got it," said Kate, lying.\r\n\r\n"He has not had yours; has he?"\r\n\r\n"He would not take it, sir."\r\n\r\n"And you offered it to him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And he has not had it?"\r\n\r\n"Not a penny of it, sir."\r\n\r\n"And what made you offer it to him after what I said to you?"\r\n\r\n"Because it was my own," said Kate, stoutly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re the biggest idiot that ever I heard of, and you\'ll know it\r\nyourself some day. Go away now, and let me know when Gogram comes."\r\n\r\nShe went away, and for a time employed herself about her ordinary\r\nhousehold work. Then she sat down alone in the dingy old dining-room,\r\nto think what had better be done in her present circumstances. The\r\ncarpet of the room was worn out, as were also the covers of the\r\nold chairs and the horsehair sofa which was never moved from its\r\naccustomed place along the wall. It was not a comfortable Squire\'s\r\nresidence, this old house at Vavasor. In the last twenty years no\r\nmoney had been spent on furniture or embellishments, and for the last\r\nten years there had been no painting, either inside or out. Twenty\r\nyears ago the Squire had been an embarrassed man, and had taken a\r\nturn in his life and had lived sparingly. It could not be said that\r\nhe had become a miser. His table was kept plentifully, and there had\r\nnever been want in his house. In some respects, too, he had behaved\r\nliberally to Kate and to others, and he had kept up the timber and\r\nfences on the property. But the house had become wretched in its\r\ndull, sombre, dirty darkness, and the gardens round it were as bad.\r\n\r\nWhat ought she now to do? She believed that her grandfather\'s last\r\ndays were coming, and she knew that others of the family should be\r\nwith him besides herself. For their sakes, for his, and for her own,\r\nit would be proper that she should not be alone there when he died.\r\nBut for whom should she send? Her brother was the natural heir, and\r\nwould be the head of the family. Her duty to him was clear, and the\r\nmore so as her grandfather was at this moment speaking of changes in\r\nhis will. But it was a question to her whether George\'s presence at\r\nVavasor, even if he would come, would not at this moment do more harm\r\nthan good to his own interests. It would make some prejudicial change\r\nin the old man\'s will more probable instead of less so. George would\r\nnot become soft and mild-spoken even by a death-bed side, and it\r\nwould be likely enough that the Squire would curse his heir with his\r\ndying breath. She might send for her uncle John; but if she did so\r\nwithout telling George she would be treating George unfairly; and she\r\nknew that it was improbable that her uncle and her brother should act\r\ntogether in anything. Her aunt Greenow, she thought, would come to\r\nher, and her presence would not influence the Squire in any way with\r\nreference to the property. So she made up her mind at last that she\r\nwould ask her aunt to come to Vavasor, and that she would tell her\r\nbrother accurately all that she could tell,--leaving him to come or\r\nstay, as he might think. Alice would, no doubt, learn all the facts\r\nfrom him, and her uncle John would hear them from Alice. Then they\r\ncould do as they pleased. As soon as Mr. Gogram had been there she\r\nwould write her letters, and they should be sent over to Shap early\r\non the following morning.\r\n\r\nMr. Gogram came and was closeted with the Squire, and the doctor\r\nalso came. The doctor saw Kate, and, shaking his head, told her that\r\nher grandfather was sinking lower and lower every hour. It would be\r\ninfinitely better for him if he would take that port wine at four\r\ndoses in the day, or even at two, instead of taking it all together.\r\nKate promised to try again, but stated her conviction that the\r\ntrial would be useless. The doctor, when pressed on the matter,\r\nsaid that his patient might probably live a week, not improbably a\r\nfortnight,--perhaps a month, if he would be obedient,--and so forth.\r\nGogram went away without seeing Kate; and Kate, who looked upon a\r\nwill as an awful and somewhat tedious ceremony, was in doubt whether\r\nher grandfather would live to complete any new operation. But, in\r\ntruth, the will had been made and signed and witnessed,--the parish\r\nclerk and one of the tenants having been had up into the room as\r\nwitnesses. Kate knew that the men had been there, but still did not\r\nthink that a new will had been perfected.\r\n\r\nThat evening when it was dusk the Squire came into the dining-room,\r\nhaving been shuffling about the grand sweep before the house for a\r\nquarter of an hour. The day was cold and the wind bleak, but still\r\nhe would go out, and Kate had wrapped him up carefully in mufflers\r\nand great-coats. Now he came in to what he called dinner, and Kate\r\nsat down with him. He had drank no wine that day, although she had\r\nbrought it to him twice during the morning. Now he attempted to\r\nswallow a little soup, but failed; and after that, while Kate was\r\neating her bit of chicken, had the decanter put before him. "I can\'t\r\neat, and I suppose it won\'t hurt you if I take my wine at once," he\r\nsaid. It went against the grain with him, even yet, that he could not\r\nwait till the cloth was gone from the table, but his impatience for\r\nthe only sustenance that he could take was too much for him.\r\n\r\n"But you should eat something, sir; will you have a bit of toast to\r\nsop in your wine?"\r\n\r\nThe word "sop" was badly chosen, and made the old Squire angry.\r\n"Sopped toast! why am I to spoil the only thing I can enjoy?"\r\n\r\n"But the wine would do you more good if you would take something with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Good! Nothing will do me any good any more. As for eating, you know\r\nI can\'t eat. What\'s the use of bothering me?" Then he filled his\r\nsecond glass, and paused awhile before he put it to his lips. He\r\nnever exceeded four glasses, but the four he was determined that he\r\nwould have, as long as he could lift them to his mouth.\r\n\r\nKate finished, or pretended to finish, her dinner within five\r\nminutes, in order that the table might be made to look comfortable\r\nfor him. Then she poked the fire, and brushed up the hearth, and\r\nclosed the old curtains with her own hands, moving about silently. As\r\nshe moved his eye followed her, and when she came behind his chair,\r\nand pushed the decanter a little more within his reach, he put out\r\nhis rough, hairy hand, and laid it upon one of hers which she had\r\nrested on the table, with a tenderness that was unusual with him.\r\n"You are a good girl, Kate. I wish you had been a boy, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"If I had, I shouldn\'t, perhaps, have been here to take care of you,"\r\nshe said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"No; you\'d have been like your brother, no doubt. Not that I think\r\nthere could have been two so bad as he is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, grandfather, if he has offended you, you should try to forgive\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Try to forgive him! How often have I forgiven him without any\r\ntrying? Why did he come down here the other day, and insult me for\r\nthe last time? Why didn\'t he keep away, as I had bidden him?"\r\n\r\n"But you gave him leave to see you, sir."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t give him leave to treat me like that. Never mind; he will\r\nfind that, old as I am, I can punish an insult."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t done anything, sir, to injure him?" said Kate.\r\n\r\n"I have made another will, that\'s all. Do you suppose I had that man\r\nhere all the way from Penrith for nothing?"\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t done yet?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you it is done. If I left him the whole property it would be\r\ngone in two years\' time. What\'s the use of doing it?"\r\n\r\n"But for his life, sir! You had promised him that he should have it\r\nfor his life."\r\n\r\n"How dare you tell me that? I never promised him. As my heir, he\r\nwould have had it all, if he would have behaved himself with common\r\ndecency. Even though I disliked him, as I always have done, he should\r\nhave had it."\r\n\r\n"And you have taken it from him altogether?"\r\n\r\n"I shall answer no questions about it, Kate." Then a fit of coughing\r\ncame upon him, his four glasses of wine having been all taken, and\r\nthere was no further talk about business. During the evening Kate\r\nread a chapter of the Bible out loud. But the Squire was very\r\nimpatient under the reading, and positively refused permission for\r\na second. "There isn\'t any good in so much of it, all at once," he\r\nsaid, using almost exactly the same words which Kate had used to him\r\nabout the port wine. There may have been good produced by the small\r\nquantity to which he listened, as there is good from the physic which\r\nchildren take with wry faces, most unwillingly. Who can say?\r\n\r\nFor many weeks past Kate had begged her uncle to allow the clergyman\r\nof Vavasor to come to him; but he had positively declined. The vicar\r\nwas a young man to whom the living had lately been given by the\r\nChancellor, and he had commenced his career by giving instant offence\r\nto the Squire. This vicar\'s predecessor had been an old man, almost\r\nas old as the Squire himself, and had held the living for forty\r\nyears. He had been a Westmoreland man, had read the prayers and\r\npreached his one Sunday sermon in a Westmoreland dialect, getting\r\nthrough the whole operation rather within an hour and a quarter. He\r\nhad troubled none of his parishioners by much advice, and had been\r\nmeek and obedient to the Squire. Knowing the country well, and being\r\nused to its habits, he had lived, and been charitable too, on the\r\nproceeds of his living, which had never reached two hundred a year.\r\nBut the new comer was a close-fisted man, with higher ideas of\r\npersonal comfort, who found it necessary to make every penny go as\r\nfar as possible, who made up in preaching for what he could not\r\ngive away in charity; who established an afternoon service, and who\r\nhad rebuked the Squire for saying that the doing so was trash and\r\nnonsense. Since that the Squire had never been inside the church,\r\nexcept on the occasion of Christmas-day. For this, indeed, the state\r\nof his health gave ample excuse; but he had positively refused to\r\nsee the vicar, though that gentleman had assiduously called, and had\r\nat last desired the servant to tell the clergyman not to come again\r\nunless he were sent for. Kate\'s task was, therefore, difficult, both\r\nas regarded the temporal and spiritual wants of her grandfather.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading was finished, the old man dozed in his chair for\r\nhalf an hour. He would not go up to bed before the enjoyment of that\r\nluxury. He was daily implored to do so, because that sleep in the\r\nchair interfered so fatally with his chance of sleeping in bed. But\r\nsleep in his chair he would and did. Then he woke, and after a fit\r\nof coughing, was induced, with much ill-humour, to go up to his room.\r\nKate had never seen him so weak. He was hardly able, even with her\r\nassistance and that of the old servant, to get up the broad stairs.\r\nBut there was still some power left to him for violence of language\r\nafter he got to his room, and he rated Kate and the old woman loudly,\r\nbecause his slippers were not in the proper place. "Grandfather,"\r\nsaid Kate, "would you like me to stay in the room with you to-night?"\r\nHe rated her again for this proposition, and then, with assistance\r\nfrom the nurse, he was gotten into bed and was left alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The last of the old squire.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that Kate went to her own room and wrote her letters. The first\r\nshe wrote was to her aunt Greenow. That was easily enough written. To\r\nMrs. Greenow it was not necessary that she should say anything about\r\nmoney. She simply stated her belief that her grandfather\'s last day\r\nwas near at hand, and begged her aunt to come and pay a last visit to\r\nthe old man. "It will be a great comfort to me in my distress," she\r\nsaid; "and it will be a satisfaction to you to have seen your father\r\nagain." She knew that her aunt would come, and that task was soon\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nBut her letter to her brother was much more difficult. What should\r\nshe tell him, and what should she not tell him? She began by\r\ndescribing her grandfather\'s state, and by saying to him, as she\r\nhad done to Mrs. Greenow, that she believed the old man\'s hours were\r\nwell-nigh come to a close. She told him that she had asked her aunt\r\nto come to her; "not," she said, "that I think her coming will be\r\nof material service, but I feel the loneliness of the house will be\r\ntoo much for me at such a time. I must leave it for you to decide,"\r\nshe said, "whether you had better be here. If anything should\r\nhappen,"--people when writing such letters are always afraid to speak\r\nof death by its proper name,--"I will send you a message, and no\r\ndoubt you would come at once." Then came the question of the will.\r\nHad it not occurred to her that her own interests were involved\r\nshe would have said nothing on the subject; but she feared her\r\nbrother,--feared even his misconstruction of her motives, even though\r\nshe was willing to sacrifice so much on his behalf,--and therefore\r\nshe resolved to tell him all that she knew. He might turn upon her\r\nhereafter if she did not do so, and accuse her of a silence which had\r\nbeen prejudicial to him.\r\n\r\nSo she told it all, and the letter became long in the telling. "I\r\nwrite with a heavy heart," she said, "because I know it will be a\r\ngreat blow to you. He gave me to understand that in this will he left\r\neverything away from you. I cannot declare that he said so directly.\r\nIndeed I cannot remember his words; but that was the impression he\r\nleft on me. The day before he had asked me what I should do if he\r\ngave me the estate; but of course I treated that as a joke. I have no\r\nidea what he put into his will. I have not even attempted to guess.\r\nBut now I have told you all that I know." The letter was a very long\r\none, and was not finished till late; but when it was completed she\r\nhad the two taken out into the kitchen, as the boy was to start with\r\nthem before daylight.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning she crept silently into her grandfather\'s\r\nroom, as was her habit; but he was apparently sleeping, and then she\r\ncrept back again. The old servant told her that the Squire had been\r\nawake at four, and at five, and at six, and had called for her. Then\r\nhe had seemed to go to sleep. Four or five times in the course of the\r\nmorning Kate went into the room, but her grandfather did not notice\r\nher. At last she feared he might already have passed away, and she\r\nput her hand upon his shoulder, and down his arm. He then gently\r\ntouched her hand with his, showing her plainly that he was not\r\nonly alive, but conscious. She then offered him food,--the thin\r\nporridge,--which he was wont to take, and the medicine. She offered\r\nhim some wine too, but he would take nothing.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock a letter was brought to her, which had come by the\r\npost. She saw that it was from Alice, and opening it found that it\r\nwas very long. At that moment she could not read it, but she saw\r\nwords in it that made her wish to know its contents as quickly as\r\npossible. But she could not leave her grandfather then. At two\r\no\'clock the doctor came to him, and remained there till the dusk of\r\nthe evening had commenced. At eight o\'clock the old man was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nShowing How Alice Was Punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Kate\'s condition at the old Hall on that night was very sad.\r\nThe presence of death is always a source of sorrow, even though the\r\ncircumstances of the case are of a kind to create no agony of grief.\r\nThe old man who had just passed away up-stairs was fully due to go.\r\nHe had lived his span all out, and had himself known that to die was\r\nthe one thing left for him to do. Kate also had expected his death,\r\nand had felt that the time had come in which it would be foolish even\r\nto wish that it should be arrested. But death close to one is always\r\nsad as it is solemn.\r\n\r\nAnd she was quite alone at Vavasor Hall. She had no acquaintance\r\nwithin some miles of her. From the young vicar, though she herself\r\nhad not quarrelled with him, she could receive no comfort, as she\r\nhardly knew him; nor was she of a temperament which would dispose her\r\nto turn to a clergyman at such a time for comfort, unless to one who\r\nmight have been an old friend. Her aunt and brother would probably\r\nboth come to her, but they could hardly be with her for a day or two,\r\nand during that day or two it would be needful that orders should\r\nbe given which it is disagreeable for a woman to have to give. The\r\nservants, moreover, in the house were hardly fit to assist her much.\r\nThere was an old butler, or footman, who had lived at the Hall for\r\nmore than fifty years, but he was crippled with rheumatism, and so\r\nladen with maladies, that he rarely crept out of his own room. He was\r\nsimply an additional burden on the others. There was a boy who had\r\nlately done all the work which the other should have done, and ever\r\nso much more beside. There is no knowing how much work such a boy\r\nwill do when properly drilled, and he was now Kate\'s best minister in\r\nher distress. There was the old nurse,--but she had been simply good\r\nfor nursing, and there were two rough Westmoreland girls who called\r\nthemselves cook and housemaid.\r\n\r\nOn that first evening,--the very day on which her grandfather had\r\ndied,--Kate would have been more comfortable had she really found\r\nsomething that she could do. But there was in truth nothing. She\r\nhovered for an hour or two in and out of the room, conscious of the\r\nletter which she had in her pocket, and very desirous in heart of\r\nreading it, but restrained by a feeling that at such a moment she\r\nought to think only of the dead. In this she was wrong. Let the\r\nliving think of the dead, when their thoughts will travel that way\r\nwhether the thinker wish it or no. Grief taken up because grief is\r\nsupposed to be proper, is only one degree better than pretended\r\ngrief. When one sees it, one cannot but think of the lady who asked\r\nher friend, in confidence, whether hot roast fowl and bread-sauce\r\nwere compatible with the earliest state of weeds; or of that other\r\nlady,--a royal lady she,--who was much comforted in the tedium of her\r\ntrouble when assured by one of the lords about the Court that piquet\r\nwas mourning.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night, near eleven, before Kate took out her letter\r\nand read it. As something of my story hangs upon it, I will give it\r\nat length, though it was a long letter. It had been written with\r\ngreat struggles, and with many tears, and Kate, as she read it to the\r\nend, almost forgot that her grandfather was lying dead in the room\r\nabove her.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Queen Anne Street, April, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST KATE,\r\n\r\n   I hardly know how to write to you--what I have to tell,\r\n   and yet I must tell it. I must tell it to you, but I shall\r\n   never repeat the story to any one else. I should have\r\n   written yesterday, when it occurred, but I was so ill that\r\n   I felt myself unable to make the exertion. Indeed, at one\r\n   time, after your brother had left me, I almost doubted\r\n   whether I should ever be able to collect my thoughts\r\n   again. My dismay was at first so great that my reason for\r\n   a time deserted me, and I could only sit and cry like an\r\n   idiot.\r\n\r\n   Dear Kate, I hope you will not be angry with me for\r\n   telling you. I have endeavoured to think about it as\r\n   calmly as I can, and I believe that I have no alternative.\r\n   The fact that your brother has quarrelled with me cannot\r\n   be concealed from you, and I must not leave him to tell\r\n   you of the manner of it. He came to me yesterday in great\r\n   anger. His anger then was nothing to what it became\r\n   afterwards; but even when he first came in he was full of\r\n   wrath. He stood up before me, and asked me how it had come\r\n   to pass that I had sent him the money which he had asked\r\n   of me through the hands of Mr. Grey. Of course I had not\r\n   done this, and so I told him at once. I had spoken of\r\n   the matter to no one but papa, and he had managed it for\r\n   me. Even now I know nothing of it, and as I have not yet\r\n   spoken to papa I cannot understand it. George at once told\r\n   me that he disbelieved me, and when I sat quiet under\r\n   this insult, he used harsher words, and said that I had\r\n   conspired to lower him before the world.\r\n\r\n   He then asked me whether I loved him. Oh, Kate, I must\r\n   tell it you all, though it is dreadful to me that I should\r\n   have to write it. You remember how it came to pass when we\r\n   were in Westmoreland together at Christmas? Do not think\r\n   that I am blaming you, but I was very rash then in the\r\n   answers which I made to him. I thought that I could be\r\n   useful to him as his wife, and I had told myself that it\r\n   would be good that I should be of use in some way. When\r\n   he asked me that question yesterday, I sat silent. Indeed,\r\n   how could I have answered it in the affirmative, when he\r\n   had just used such language to me,--while he was standing\r\n   opposite to me, looking at me in that way which he has\r\n   when he is enraged? Then he spoke again and demanded of me\r\n   that I should at once send back to Mr. Grey all presents\r\n   of his which I had kept, and at the same time took up and\r\n   threw across the table on to the sofa near me, a little\r\n   paper knife which Mr. Grey once gave me. I could not allow\r\n   myself to be so ordered by him; so I said nothing, but put\r\n   the knife back upon the table. He then took it again and\r\n   threw it beneath the grate. "I have a right to look upon\r\n   you as my wife," he said, "and, as such, I will not allow\r\n   you to keep that man\'s things about you." I think I told\r\n   him then that I should never become his wife, but though\r\n   I remember many of his words, I remember none of my own.\r\n   He swore, I know, with a great oath, that if I went back\r\n   a second time from my word to him he would leave me no\r\n   peace,--that he would punish me for my perfidy with some\r\n   fearful punishment. Oh, Kate, I cannot tell you what he\r\n   looked like. He had then come quite close to me, and I\r\n   know that I trembled before him as though he were going\r\n   to strike me. Of course I said nothing. What could I say\r\n   to a man who behaved to me in such a manner? Then, as far\r\n   as I can remember it, he sat down and began to talk about\r\n   money. I forget what he said at first, but I know that I\r\n   assured him that he might take what he wanted so long as\r\n   enough was left to prevent my being absolutely a burden\r\n   on papa. "That, madam, is a matter of course," he said. I\r\n   remember those words so well. Then he explained that after\r\n   what had passed between us, I had no right to ruin him by\r\n   keeping back from him money which had been promised to\r\n   him, and which was essential to his success. In this, dear\r\n   Kate, I think he was mainly right. But he could not have\r\n   been right in putting it to me in that hard, cruel manner,\r\n   especially as I had never refused anything that he had\r\n   asked of me in respect of money. The money he may have\r\n   while it lasts; but then there must be an end of it all\r\n   between us, even though he should have the power of\r\n   punishing me, as he says he will do. Punishing me, indeed!\r\n   What punishment can be so hard as that which he has\r\n   already inflicted?\r\n\r\n   He then desired me to write a letter to him which he\r\n   might show to the lawyer,--to our own lawyer, I think he\r\n   meant,--in order that money might be raised to pay back\r\n   what Mr. Grey had advanced, and give him what he now\r\n   required. I think he said it was to be five thousand\r\n   pounds. When he asked this I did not move. Indeed, I was\r\n   unable to move. Then he spoke very loud, and swore at me\r\n   again, and brought me pen and ink, demanding that I should\r\n   write the letter. I was so frightened that I thought of\r\n   running to the door to escape, and I would have done so\r\n   had I not distrusted my own power. Had it been to save my\r\n   life I could not have written the letter. I believe I was\r\n   now crying,--at any rate I threw myself back and covered\r\n   my face with my hands. Then he came and sat by me, and\r\n   took hold of my arms. Oh, Kate; I cannot tell it you all.\r\n   He put his mouth close to my ear, and said words which\r\n   were terrible, though I did not understand them. I do\r\n   not know what it was he said, but he was threatening me\r\n   with his anger if I did not obey him. Before he left me,\r\n   I believe I found my voice to tell him that he should\r\n   certainly have the money which he required. And so he\r\n   shall. I will go to Mr. Round myself, and insist on its\r\n   being done. My money is my own, and I may do with it as\r\n   I please. But I hope,--I am obliged to hope, that I may\r\n   never be made to see my cousin again.\r\n\r\n   I will not pretend to express any opinion as to the cause\r\n   of all this. It is very possible that you will not believe\r\n   all I say,--that you will think that I am mad and have\r\n   deluded myself. Of course your heart will prompt you to\r\n   accuse me rather than him. If it is so, and if there must\r\n   therefore be a division between us, my grief will be\r\n   greatly increased; but I do not know that I can help it.\r\n   I cannot keep all this back from you. He has cruelly\r\n   ill-used me and insulted me. He has treated me as I\r\n   should have thought no man could have treated a woman. As\r\n   regards money, I did all that I could do to show that I\r\n   trusted him thoroughly, and my confidence has only led\r\n   to suspicion. I do not know whether he understands that\r\n   everything must be over between us; but, if not, I must\r\n   ask you to tell him so. And I must ask you to explain to\r\n   him that he must not come again to Queen Anne Street. If\r\n   he does, nothing shall induce me to see him. Tell him also\r\n   that the money that he wants shall assuredly be sent to\r\n   him as soon as I can make Mr. Round get it.\r\n\r\n   Dearest Kate, good-bye. I hope you will feel for me.\r\n   If you do not answer me I shall presume that you think\r\n   yourself bound to support his side, and to believe me to\r\n   have been wrong. It will make me very unhappy; but I shall\r\n   remember that you are his sister, and I shall not be angry\r\n   with you.\r\n\r\n   Yours always affectionately,\r\n\r\n   ALICE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate, as she read her letter through, at first quickly, and then\r\nvery slowly, came by degrees almost to forget that death was in the\r\nhouse. Her mind, and heart, and brain, were filled with thoughts and\r\nfeelings that had exclusive reference to Alice and her brother, and\r\nat last she found herself walking the room with quick, impetuous\r\nsteps, while her blood was hot with indignation.\r\n\r\nAll her sympathies in the matter were with Alice. It never occurred\r\nto her to disbelieve a word of the statement made to her, or to\r\nsuggest to herself that it had been coloured by any fears or\r\nexaggerations on the part of her correspondent. She knew that Alice\r\nwas true. And, moreover, much as she loved her brother,--willing as\r\nshe had been and would still be to risk all that she possessed, and\r\nherself also, on his behalf,--she knew that it would be risking and\r\nnot trusting. She loved her brother, such love having come to her\r\nby nature, and having remained with her from of old; and in his\r\nintellect she still believed. But she had ceased to have belief in\r\nhis conduct. She feared everything that he might do, and lived with\r\na consciousness that though she was willing to connect all her own\r\nfortunes with his, she had much reason to expect that she might\r\nencounter ruin in doing so. Her sin had been in this,--that she had\r\nbeen anxious to subject Alice to the same danger,--that she had\r\nintrigued, sometimes very meanly, to bring about the object which\r\nshe had at heart,--that she had used all her craft to separate Alice\r\nfrom Mr. Grey. Perhaps it may be alleged in her excuse that she had\r\nthought,--had hoped rather than thought,--that the marriage which she\r\ncontemplated would change much in her brother that was wrong, and\r\nbring him into a mode of life that would not be dangerous. Might not\r\nshe and Alice together so work upon him, that he should cease to\r\nstand ever on the brink of some half-seen precipice? To risk herself\r\nfor her brother was noble. But when she used her cunning in inducing\r\nher cousin to share that risk she was ignoble. Of this she had\r\nherself some consciousness, as she walked up and down the old\r\ndining-room at midnight, holding her cousin\'s letter in her hand.\r\n\r\nHer cheeks became tinged with shame as she thought of the scene\r\nwhich Alice had described,--the toy thrown beneath the grate, the\r\nloud curses, the whispered threats, which had been more terrible\r\nthan curses, the demand for money, made with something worse than a\r\ncut-throat\'s violence, the strong man\'s hand placed upon the woman\'s\r\narm in anger and in rage, those eyes glaring, and the gaping horror\r\nof that still raw cicatrice, as he pressed his face close to that\r\nof his victim! Not for a moment did she think of defending him. She\r\naccused him to herself vehemently of a sin over and above those\r\nsins which had filled Alice with dismay. He had demanded money\r\nfrom the girl whom he intended to marry! According to Kate\'s idea,\r\nnothing could excuse or palliate this sin. Alice had accounted\r\nit as nothing,--had expressed her opinion that the demand was\r\nreasonable;--even now, after the ill-usage to which she had been\r\nsubjected, she had declared that the money should be forthcoming, and\r\ngiven to the man who had treated her so shamefully. It might be well\r\nthat Alice should so feel and so act, but it behoved Kate to feel\r\nand act very differently. She would tell her brother, even in the\r\nhouse of death, should he come there, that his conduct was mean and\r\nunmanly. Kate was no coward. She declared to herself that she would\r\ndo this even though he should threaten her with all his fury,--though\r\nhe should glare upon her with all the horrors of his countenance.\r\n\r\nOne o\'clock, and two o\'clock, still found her in the dark sombre\r\nparlour, every now and then pacing the floor of the room. The fire\r\nhad gone out, and, though it was now the middle of April, she began\r\nto feel the cold. But she would not go to bed before she had written\r\na line to Alice. To her brother a message by telegraph would of\r\ncourse be sent the next morning; as also would she send a message\r\nto her aunt. But to Alice she would write, though it might be but a\r\nline. Cold as she was, she found her pens and paper, and wrote her\r\nletter that night. It was very short. "Dear Alice, to-day I received\r\nyour letter, and to-day our poor old grandfather died. Tell my uncle\r\nJohn, with my love, of his father\'s death. You will understand that\r\nI cannot write much now about that other matter; but I must tell you,\r\neven at such a moment as this, that there shall be no quarrel between\r\nyou and me. There shall be none at least on my side. I cannot say\r\nmore till a few days shall have passed by. He is lying up-stairs,\r\na corpse. I have telegraphed to George, and I suppose he will come\r\ndown. I think my aunt Greenow will come also, as I had written to her\r\nbefore, seeing that I wanted the comfort of having her here. Uncle\r\nJohn will of course come or not as he thinks fitting. I don\'t know\r\nwhether I am in a position to say that I shall be glad to see him;\r\nbut I should be very glad. He and you will know that I can, as yet,\r\ntell you nothing further. The lawyer is to see the men about the\r\nfuneral. Nothing, I suppose, will be done till George comes. Your own\r\ncousin and friend, KATE VAVASOR." And then she added a line below,\r\n"My own Alice,--If you will let me, you shall be my sister, and be\r\nthe nearest to me and the dearest."\r\n\r\nAlice, when she received this, was at the first moment so much\r\nstruck, and indeed surprised, by the tidings of her grandfather\'s\r\ndeath, that she was forced, in spite of the still existing violence\r\nof her own feelings, to think and act chiefly with reference to that\r\nevent. Her father had not then left his room. She therefore went to\r\nhim, and handed him Kate\'s letter. "Papa," she said, "there is news\r\nfrom Westmoreland; bad news, which you hardly expected yet." "My\r\nfather is dead," said John Vavasor. Whereupon Alice gave him Kate\'s\r\nletter, that he might read it. "Of course I shall go down," he said,\r\nas he came to that part in which Kate had spoken of him. "Does she\r\nthink I shall not follow my father to the grave, because I dislike\r\nher brother? What does she mean by saying that there shall be no\r\nquarrel between you and her?" "I will explain that at another time,"\r\nsaid Alice. John Vavasor asked no further questions then, but\r\ndeclared at first that he should go to Westmoreland on the following\r\nday. Then he altered his purpose. "I\'ll go by the mail train\r\nto-night," he said. "It will be very disagreeable, but I ought to\r\nbe there when the will is opened." There was very little more said\r\nin Queen Anne Street on the subject till the evening,--till a few\r\nmoments before Mr. Vavasor left his house. He indeed had thought\r\nnothing more about that quarrelling, or rather that promise that\r\nthere should be no quarrelling, between the girls. He still regarded\r\nhis nephew George as the man who, unfortunately, was to be his\r\nson-in-law, and now, during this tedious sad day, in which he felt\r\nhimself compelled to remain at home, he busied his mind in thinking\r\nof George and Alice, as living together at the old Hall. At six, the\r\nfather and daughter dined, and soon after dinner Mr. Vavasor went up\r\nto his own room to prepare himself for his journey. After a while\r\nAlice followed him,--but she did not do so till she knew that if\r\nanything was to be told before the journey no further time could be\r\nlost. "Papa," she said, as soon as she had shut the door behind her,\r\n"I think I ought to tell you before you go that everything is over\r\nbetween me and George."\r\n\r\n"Have you quarrelled with him too?" said her father, with\r\nuncontrolled surprise.\r\n\r\n"I should perhaps say that he has quarrelled with me. But, dear papa,\r\npray do not question me at present. I will tell you all when you come\r\nback, but I thought it right that you should know this before you\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"It has been his doing then?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot explain it to you in a hurry like this. Papa, you may\r\nunderstand something of the shame which I feel, and you should not\r\nquestion me now."\r\n\r\n"And John Grey?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing different in regard to him."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be shot if I can understand you. George, you know, has had\r\ntwo thousand pounds of your money,--of yours or somebody else\'s.\r\nWell, we can\'t talk about it now, as I must be off. Thinking as I\r\ndo of George, I\'m glad of it,--that\'s all." Then he went, and Alice\r\nwas left alone, to comfort herself as best she might by her own\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor had received the message on the day previous to that\r\non which Alice\'s letter had reached her, but it had not come to him\r\ntill late in the day. He might have gone down by the mail train of\r\nthat night, but there were one or two persons, his own attorney\r\nespecially, whom he wished to see before the reading of his\r\ngrandfather\'s will. He remained in town, therefore, on the following\r\nday, and went down by the same train as that which took his uncle.\r\nWalking along the platform, looking for a seat, he peered into a\r\ncarriage and met his uncle\'s eye. The two saw each other, but did not\r\nspeak, and George passed on to another carriage. On the following\r\nmorning, before the break of day, they met again in the refreshment\r\nroom, at the station at Lancaster. "So my father has gone, George,"\r\nsaid the uncle, speaking to the nephew. They must go to the same\r\nhouse, and Mr. Vavasor felt that it would be better that they should\r\nbe on speaking terms when they reached it. "Yes," said George; "he\r\nhas gone at last. I wonder what we shall find to have been his latest\r\nact of injustice." The reader will remember that he had received\r\nKate\'s first letter, in which she had told him of the Squire\'s\r\naltered will. John Vavasor turned away disgusted. His finer feelings\r\nwere perhaps not very strong, but he had no thoughts or hopes in\r\nreference to the matter which were mean. He expected nothing himself,\r\nand did not begrudge his nephew the inheritance. At this moment he\r\nwas thinking of the old Squire as a father who had ever been kind\r\nto him. It might be natural that George should have no such old\r\naffection at his heart, but it was unnatural that he should express\r\nhimself as he had done at such a moment.\r\n\r\nThe uncle turned away, but said nothing. George followed him with\r\na little proposition of his own. "We shan\'t get any conveyance at\r\nShap," he said. "Hadn\'t we better go over in a chaise from Kendal?"\r\nTo this the uncle assented, and so they finished their journey\r\ntogether. George smoked all the time that they were in the carriage,\r\nand very few words were spoken. As they drove up to the old house,\r\nthey found that another arrival had taken place before them,--Mrs.\r\nGreenow having reached the house in some vehicle from the Shap\r\nstation. She had come across from Norwich to Manchester, where she\r\nhad joined the train which had brought the uncle and nephew from\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nThe Will.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of Mrs. Greenow at this very moment was a great comfort\r\nto Kate. Without her she would hardly have known how to bear herself\r\nwith her uncle and her brother. As it was, they were all restrained\r\nby something of the courtesy which strangers are bound to show to\r\neach other. George had never seen his aunt since he was a child, and\r\nsome sort of introduction was necessary between them.\r\n\r\n"So you are George," said Mrs. Greenow, putting out her hand and\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'m George," said he.\r\n\r\n"And a Member of Parliament!" said Mrs. Greenow. "It\'s quite an\r\nhonour to the family. I felt so proud when I heard it!" She said this\r\npleasantly, meaning it to be taken for truth, and then turned away to\r\nher brother. "Papa\'s time was fully come," she said, "though, to tell\r\nthe truth, I had no idea that he was so weak as Kate describes him to\r\nhave been."\r\n\r\n"Nor I, either," said John Vavasor. "He went to church with us here\r\non Christmas-day."\r\n\r\n"Did he, indeed? Dear, dear! He seems at last to have gone off just\r\nlike poor Greenow." Here she put her handkerchief up to her face. "I\r\nthink you didn\'t know Greenow, John?"\r\n\r\n"I met him once," said her brother.\r\n\r\n"Ah! he wasn\'t to be known and understood in that way. I\'m aware\r\nthere was a little prejudice, because of his being in trade, but\r\nwe won\'t talk of that now. Where should I have been without him,\r\ntradesman or no tradesman?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt he was an excellent man."\r\n\r\n"You may say that, John. Ah, well! we can\'t keep everything in this\r\nlife for ever." It may, perhaps, be as well to explain now that Mrs.\r\nGreenow had told Captain Bellfield at their last meeting before\r\nshe left Norwich, that, under certain circumstances, if he behaved\r\nhimself well, there might possibly be ground of hope. Whereupon\r\nCaptain Bellfield had immediately gone to the best tailor in that\r\ncity, had told the man of his coming marriage, and had given an\r\nextensive order. But the tailor had not as yet supplied the goods,\r\nwaiting for more credible evidence of the Captain\'s good fortune.\r\n"We\'re all grass of the field," said Mrs. Greenow, lightly brushing\r\na tear from her eye, "and must be cut down and put into the oven in\r\nour turns." Her brother uttered a slight sympathetic groan, shaking\r\nhis head in testimony of the uncertainty of human affairs, and then\r\nsaid that he would go out and look about the place. George, in the\r\nmeantime, had asked his sister to show him his room, and the two were\r\nalready together up-stairs.\r\n\r\nKate had made up her mind that she would say nothing about Alice at\r\nthe present moment,--nothing, if it could be avoided, till after the\r\nfuneral. She led the way up-stairs, almost trembling with fear, for\r\nshe knew that that other subject of the will would also give rise to\r\ntrouble and sorrow,--perhaps, also, to determined quarrelling.\r\n\r\n"What has brought that woman here?" was the first question that\r\nGeorge asked.\r\n\r\n"I asked her to come," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"And why did you ask her to come here?" said George, angrily. Kate\r\nimmediately felt that he was speaking as though he were master of\r\nthe house, and also as though he intended to be master of her. As\r\nregarded the former idea, she had no objection to it. She thoroughly\r\nand honestly wished that he might be the master; and though she\r\nfeared that he might find himself mistaken in his assumption, she\r\nherself was not disposed to deny any appearance of right that he\r\nmight take upon himself in that respect. But she had already begun to\r\ntell herself that she must not submit herself to his masterdom. She\r\nhad gradually so taught herself since he had compelled her to write\r\nthe first letter in which Alice had been asked to give her money.\r\n\r\n"I asked her, George, before my poor grandfather\'s death, when I\r\nthought that he would linger perhaps for weeks. My life here alone\r\nwith him, without any other woman in the house beside the servants,\r\nwas very melancholy."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not ask Alice to come to you?"\r\n\r\n"Alice could not have come," said Kate, after a short pause.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why she shouldn\'t have come. I won\'t have that woman\r\nabout the place. She disgraced herself by marrying a blacksmith--."\r\n\r\n"Why, George, it was you yourself who advised me to go and stay with\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very different thing. Now that he\'s dead, and she\'s got his\r\nmoney, it\'s all very well that you should go to her occasionally; but\r\nI won\'t have her here."\r\n\r\n"It\'s natural that she should come to her father\'s house at her\r\nfather\'s death-bed."\r\n\r\n"I hate to be told that things are natural. It always means humbug.\r\nI don\'t suppose she cared for the old man any more than I did,--or\r\nthan she cared for the other old man who married her. People are\r\nsuch intense hypocrites. There\'s my uncle John, pulling a long face\r\nbecause he has come into this house, and he will pull it as long as\r\nthe body lies up there; and yet for the last twenty years there\'s\r\nnothing on earth he has so much hated as going to see his father.\r\nWhen are they going to bury him?"\r\n\r\n"On Saturday, the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t they do it to-morrow, so that we could get away before\r\nSunday?"\r\n\r\n"He only died on Monday, George," said Kate, solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Psha! Who has got the will?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gogram. He was here yesterday, and told me to tell you and uncle\r\nJohn that he would have it with him when he came back from the\r\nfuneral."\r\n\r\n"What has my uncle John to do with it?" said George, sharply. "I\r\nshall go over to Penrith this afternoon and make Gogram give it up to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'ll do that, George."\r\n\r\n"What right has he to keep it? What right has he to it at all? How do\r\nI know that he has really got the old man\'s last will? Where did my\r\ngrandfather keep his papers?"\r\n\r\n"In that old secretary, as he used to call it; the one that stands in\r\nthe dining-room. It is sealed up."\r\n\r\n"Who sealed it?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gogram did,--Mr. Gogram and I together."\r\n\r\n"What the deuce made you meddle with it?"\r\n\r\n"I merely assisted him. But I believe he was quite right. I think it\r\nis usual in such cases."\r\n\r\n"Balderdash! You are thinking of some old trumpery of former days.\r\nTill I know to the contrary, everything here belongs to me as\r\nheir-at-law, and I do not mean to allow of any interference till I\r\nknow for certain that my rights have been taken from me. And I won\'t\r\naccept a death-bed will. What a man chooses to write when his fingers\r\nwill hardly hold the pen, goes for nothing."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t suppose that I wish to interfere with your rights?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, George!"\r\n\r\n"Well; I say, I hope not. But I know there are those who would. Do\r\nyou think my uncle John would not interfere with me if he could?\r\nBy ----! if he does, he shall find that he does it to his cost. I\'ll\r\nlead him such a life through the courts, for the next two or three\r\nyears, that he\'ll wish that he had remained in Chancery Lane, and\r\nhad never left it."\r\n\r\nA message was now brought up by the nurse, saying that Mrs. Greenow\r\nand Mr. Vavasor were going into the room where the old Squire was\r\nlying, "Would Miss Kate and Mr. George go with them?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Vavasor!" shouted out George, making the old woman jump. She did\r\nnot understand his meaning in the least. "Yes, sir; the old Squire,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"Will you come, George?" Kate asked.\r\n\r\n"No; what should I go there for? Why should I pretend an interest in\r\nthe dead body of a man whom I hated and who hated me;--whose very\r\nlast act, as far as I know as yet, was an attempt to rob me? I won\'t\r\ngo and see him."\r\n\r\nKate went, and was glad of an opportunity of getting away from her\r\nbrother. Every hour the idea was becoming stronger in her mind that\r\nshe must in some way separate herself from him. There had come upon\r\nhim of late a hard ferocity which made him unendurable. And then he\r\ncarried to such a pitch that hatred, as he called it, of conventional\r\nrules, that he allowed himself to be controlled by none of the\r\nordinary bonds of society. She had felt this heretofore, with a\r\nnervous consciousness that she was doing wrong in endeavouring to\r\nbring about a marriage between him and Alice; but this demeanour and\r\nmode of talking had now so grown upon him that Kate began to feel\r\nherself thankful that Alice had been saved.\r\n\r\nKate went up with her uncle and aunt, and saw the face of her\r\ngrandfather for the last time. "Poor, dear old man!" said Mrs.\r\nGreenow, as the easy tears ran down her face. "Do you remember, John,\r\nhow he used to scold me, and say that I should never come to good. He\r\nhas said the same thing to you, Kate, I dare say?"\r\n\r\n"He has been very kind to me," said Kate, standing at the foot of the\r\nbed. She was not one of those whose tears stand near their eyes.\r\n\r\n"He was a fine old gentleman," said John Vavasor;--"belonging to days\r\nthat are now gone by, but by no means the less of a gentleman on that\r\naccount. I don\'t know that he ever did an unjust or ungenerous act to\r\nany one. Come, Kate, we may as well go down." Mrs. Greenow lingered to\r\nsay a word or two to the nurse, of the manner in which Greenow\'s body\r\nwas treated when Greenow was lying dead, and then she followed her\r\nbrother and niece.\r\n\r\nGeorge did not go into Penrith, nor did he see Mr. Gogram till that\r\nworthy attorney came out to Vavasor Hall on the morning of the\r\nfuneral. He said nothing more on the subject, nor did he break the\r\nseals on the old upright desk that stood in the parlour. The two\r\ndays before the funeral were very wretched for all the party, except,\r\nperhaps, for Mrs. Greenow, who affected not to understand that her\r\nnephew was in a bad humour. She called him "poor George," and treated\r\nall his incivility to herself as though it were the effect of his\r\ngrief. She asked him questions about Parliament, which, of course, he\r\ndidn\'t answer, and told him little stories about poor dear Greenow,\r\nnot heeding his expressions of unmistakable disgust.\r\n\r\nThe two days at last went by, and the hour of the funeral came. There\r\nwas the doctor and Gogram, and the uncle and the nephew, to follow\r\nthe corpse,--the nephew taking upon himself ostentatiously the\r\nforemost place, as though he could thereby help to maintain his\r\npretensions as heir. The clergyman met them at the little wicket-gate\r\nof the churchyard, having, by some reasoning, which we hope was\r\nsatisfactory to himself, overcome a resolution which he at first\r\nformed, that he would not read the burial service over an unrepentant\r\nsinner. But he did read it, having mentioned his scruples to none but\r\none confidential clerical friend in the same diocese.\r\n\r\n"I\'m told that you have got my grandfather\'s will," George said to\r\nthe attorney as soon as he saw him.\r\n\r\n"I have it in my pocket," said Mr. Gogram, "and purpose to read it as\r\nsoon as we return from church."\r\n\r\n"Is it usual to take a will away from a man\'s house in that way?"\r\nGeorge asked.\r\n\r\n"Quite usual," said the attorney; "and in this case it was done at\r\nthe express desire of the testator."\r\n\r\n"I think it is the common practice," said John Vavasor.\r\n\r\nGeorge upon this turned round at his uncle as though about to attack\r\nhim, but he restrained himself and said nothing, though he showed his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was very plain, and not a word was spoken by George\r\nVavasor during the journey there and back. John Vavasor asked a few\r\nquestions of the doctor as to the last weeks of his father\'s life;\r\nand it was incidentally mentioned, both by the doctor and by the\r\nattorney, that the old Squire\'s intellect had remained unimpaired\r\nup to the last moment that he had been seen by either of them. When\r\nthey returned to the hall Mrs. Greenow met them with an invitation to\r\nlunch. They all went to the dining-room, and drank each a glass of\r\nsherry. George took two or three glasses. The doctor then withdrew,\r\nand drove himself back to Penrith, where he lived.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go into the other room now?" said the attorney.\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen then rose up, and went across to the\r\ndrawing-room, George leading the way. The attorney followed him, and\r\nJohn Vavasor closed the door behind them. Had any observer been there\r\nto watch them he might have seen by the faces of the two latter that\r\nthey expected an unpleasant meeting. Mr. Gogram, as he had walked\r\nacross the hall, had pulled a document out of his pocket, and held\r\nit in his hand as he took a chair. John Vavasor stood behind one of\r\nthe chairs which had been placed at the table, and leaned upon it,\r\nlooking across the room, up at the ceiling. George stood on the rug\r\nbefore the fire, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and\r\nhis coat tails over his arms.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, will you sit down?" said Mr. Gogram.\r\n\r\nJohn Vavasor immediately sat down.\r\n\r\n"I prefer to stand here," said George.\r\n\r\nMr. Gogram then opened the document before him.\r\n\r\n"Before that paper is read," said George, "I think it right to say\r\na few words. I don\'t know what it contains, but I believe it to\r\nhave been executed by my grandfather only an hour or two before his\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"On the day before he died,--early in the day," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"Well,--the day before he died; it is the same thing,--while he was\r\ndying, in fact. He never got out of bed afterwards."\r\n\r\n"He was not in bed at the time, Mr. Vavasor. Not that it would have\r\nmattered if he had been. And he came down to dinner on that day. I\r\ndon\'t understand, however, why you make these observations."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll listen to me you will understand. I make them because I\r\ndeny my grandfather\'s fitness to make a will in the last moments of\r\nhis existence, and at such an age. I saw him a few weeks ago, and he\r\nwas not fit to be trusted with the management of property then."\r\n\r\n"I do not think this is the time, George, to put forward such\r\nobjections," said the uncle.\r\n\r\n"I think it is," said George. "I believe that that paper purports to\r\nbe an instrument by which I should be villanously defrauded if it\r\nwere allowed to be held as good. Therefore I protest against it now,\r\nand shall question it at law if action be taken on it. You can read\r\nit now, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I shall read," said Mr. Gogram; "and I say that it is as\r\nvalid a will as ever a man signed."\r\n\r\n"And I say it\'s not. That\'s the difference between us."\r\n\r\nThe will was read amidst sundry interjections and expressions of\r\nanger from George, which it is not necessary to repeat. Nor need I\r\ntrouble my readers with the will at length. It began by expressing\r\nthe testator\'s great desire that his property might descend in his\r\nown family, and that the house might be held and inhabited by some\r\none bearing the name of Vavasor. He then declared that he felt\r\nhimself obliged to pass over his natural heir, believing that the\r\nproperty would not be safe in his hands; he therefore left it in\r\ntrust to his son John Vavasor, whom he appointed to be sole executor\r\nof his will. He devised it to George\'s eldest son,--should George\r\never marry and have a son,--as soon as he might reach the age of\r\ntwenty-five. In the meantime the property should remain in the hands\r\nof John Vavasor for his use and benefit, with a lien on it of five\r\nhundred a year to be paid annually to his granddaughter Kate. In\r\nthe event of George having no son, the property was to go to the\r\neldest son of Kate, or failing that to the eldest son of his other\r\ngranddaughter who might take the name of Vavasor. All his personal\r\nproperty he left to his son, John Vavasor. "And, Mr. Vavasor," said\r\nthe attorney, as he finished his reading, "you will, I fear, get very\r\nlittle by that latter clause. The estate now owes nothing; but I\r\ndoubt whether the Squire had fifty pounds in his banker\'s hands when\r\nhe died, and the value of the property about the place is very small.\r\nHe has been unwilling to spend anything during the last ten years,\r\nbut has paid off every shilling that the property owed."\r\n\r\n"It is as I supposed," said George. His voice was very unpleasant,\r\nand so was the fire of his eyes and the ghastly rage of his scarred\r\nface. "The old man has endeavoured in his anger to rob me of\r\neverything because I would not obey him in his wickedness when I was\r\nhere with him a short while before he died. Such a will as that can\r\nstand nowhere."\r\n\r\n"As to that I have nothing to say at present," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"Where is his other will,--the one he made before that?"\r\n\r\n"If I remember rightly we executed two before this."\r\n\r\n"And where are they?"\r\n\r\n"It is not my business to know, Mr. Vavasor. I believe that I saw him\r\ndestroy one, but I have no absolute knowledge. As to the other, I can\r\nsay nothing."\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean to do?" said George, turning to his uncle.\r\n\r\n"Do! I shall carry out the will. I have no alternative. Your sister\r\nis the person chiefly interested under it. She gets five hundred a\r\nyear for her life; and if she marries and you don\'t, or if she has a\r\nson and you don\'t, her son will have the whole property."\r\n\r\nGeorge stood for a few moments thinking. Might it not be possible\r\nthat by means of Alice and Kate together,--by marrying the\r\nformer,--perhaps, he might still obtain possession of the property?\r\nBut that which he wanted was the command of the property at\r\nonce,--the power of raising money upon it instantly. The will had\r\nbeen so framed as to make that impossible in any way. Kate\'s share in\r\nit had not been left to her unconditionally, but was to be received\r\neven by her through the hands of her uncle John. Such a will shut him\r\nout from all his hopes. "It is a piece of d---- roguery," he said.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that, sir?" said Gogram, turning round towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I mean exactly what I say. It is a piece of d---- roguery. Who was\r\nin the room when that thing was written?"\r\n\r\n"The signature was witnessed by--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask as to the signature. Who was in the room when the thing\r\nwas written?"\r\n\r\n"I was here with your grandfather."\r\n\r\n"And no one else?"\r\n\r\n"No one else. The presence of any one else at such a time would be\r\nvery unusual."\r\n\r\n"Then I regard the document simply as waste paper." After saying\r\nthis, George Vavasor left the room, and slammed the door after him.\r\n\r\n"I never was insulted in such a way before," said the attorney,\r\nalmost with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"He is a disappointed and I fear a ruined man," said John Vavasor.\r\n"I do not think you need regard what he says."\r\n\r\n"But he should not on that account insult me. I have only done my\r\nduty. I did not even advise his grandfather. It is mean on his part\r\nand unmanly. If he comes in my way again I shall tell him so."\r\n\r\n"He probably will not put himself in your way again, Mr. Gogram."\r\n\r\nThen the attorney went, having suggested to Mr. Vavasor that he should\r\ninstruct his attorney in London to take steps in reference to the\r\nproving of the will. "It\'s as good a will as ever was made," said\r\nMr. Gogram. "If he can set that aside, I\'ll give up making wills\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\nWho was to tell Kate? That was John Vavasor\'s first thought when\r\nhe was left alone at the hall-door, after seeing the lawyer start\r\naway. And how was he to get himself back to London without further\r\nquarrelling with his nephew? And what was he to do at once with\r\nreference to the immediate duties of proprietorship which were\r\nentailed upon him as executor? It was by no means improbable, as he\r\nthought, that George might assume to himself the position of master\r\nof the house; that he might demand the keys, for instance, which\r\nno doubt were in Kate\'s hands at present, and that he would take\r\npossession with violence. What should he do under such circumstances?\r\nIt was clear that he could not run away and get back to his club by\r\nthe night mail train. He had duties there at the Hall, and these\r\nduties were of a nature to make him almost regret the position in\r\nwhich his father\'s will had placed him. Eventually he would gain some\r\nconsiderable increase to his means, but the immediate effect would\r\nbe terribly troublesome. As he looked up at the melancholy pines\r\nwhich were slowly waving their heads in the wind before the door\r\nhe declared to himself that he would sell his inheritance and his\r\nexecutorship very cheaply, if such a sale were possible.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room he found his sister alone. "Well, John," said she;\r\n"well? How is it left?"\r\n\r\n"Where is Kate?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"She has gone out with her brother."\r\n\r\n"Did he take his hat?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. He asked her to walk, and she went with him at once."\r\n\r\n"Then, I suppose, he will tell her," said John Vavasor. After that\r\nhe explained the circumstances of the will to Mrs. Greenow. "Bravo,"\r\nexclaimed the widow. "I\'m delighted. I love Kate dearly: and now she\r\ncan marry almost whom she pleases."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nAnother Walk on the Fells.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge when he left the room in which he had insulted the lawyer,\r\nwent immediately across to the parlour in which his aunt and sister\r\nwere sitting. "Kate," said he, "put on your hat and come and walk\r\nwith me. That business is over." Kate\'s hat and shawl were in the\r\nroom, and they were out of the house together within a minute.\r\n\r\nThey walked down the carriage-road, through the desolate, untenanted\r\ngrounds, to the gate, before either of them spoke a word. Kate was\r\nwaiting for George to tell her of the will, but did not dare to ask\r\nany question. George intended to tell her of the will, but was not\r\ndisposed to do so without some preparation. It was a thing not to be\r\nspoken of open-mouthed, as a piece of ordinary news. "Which way shall\r\nwe go?" said Kate, as soon as they had passed through the old rickety\r\ngate, which swung at the entrance of the place. "Up across the fell,"\r\nsaid George; "the day is fine, and I want to get away from my uncle\r\nfor a time." She turned round, therefore, outside the hill of firs,\r\nand led the way back to the beacon wood through which she and Alice\r\nhad walked across to Haweswater upon a memorable occasion. They\r\nhad reached the top of the beacon hill, and were out upon the Fell,\r\nbefore George had begun his story. Kate was half beside herself with\r\ncuriosity, but still she was afraid to ask. "Well," said George,\r\nwhen they paused a moment as they stepped over a plank that crossed\r\nthe boundary ditch of the wood: "don\'t you want to know what that\r\ndear old man has done for you?" Then he looked into her face very\r\nsteadfastly. "But perhaps you know already," he added. He had come\r\nout determined not to quarrel with his sister. He had resolved,\r\nin that moment of thought which had been allowed to him, that his\r\nbest hope for the present required that he should keep himself on\r\ngood terms with her, at any rate till he had settled what line of\r\nconduct he would pursue. But he was, in truth, so sore with anger\r\nand disappointment,--he had become so nearly mad with that continued,\r\nunappeased wrath in which he now indulged against all the world, that\r\nhe could not refrain himself from bitter words. He was as one driven\r\nby the Furies, and was no longer able to control them in their\r\ndriving of him.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of it," said Kate. "Had I known I should have told\r\nyou. Your question is unjust to me."\r\n\r\n"I am beginning to doubt," said he, "whether a man can be safe in\r\ntrusting any one. My grandfather has done his best to rob me of the\r\nproperty altogether."\r\n\r\n"I told you that I feared he would do so."\r\n\r\n"And he has made you his heir."\r\n\r\n"Me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you."\r\n\r\n"He told me distinctly that he would not do that."\r\n\r\n"But he has, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"Then, George, I shall do that which I told him I should do in the\r\nevent of his making such a will; for he asked me the question. I told\r\nhim I should restore the estate to you, and upon that he swore that\r\nhe would not leave it to me."\r\n\r\n"And what a fool you were," said he, stopping her in the pathway.\r\n"What an ass! Why did you tell him that? You knew that he would not,\r\non that account, do justice to me."\r\n\r\n"He asked me, George."\r\n\r\n"Psha! now you have ruined me, and you might have saved me."\r\n\r\n"But I will save you still, if he has left the estate to me. I do not\r\ndesire to take it from you. As God in heaven sees me, I have never\r\nceased to endeavour to protect your interests here at Vavasor. I will\r\nsign anything necessary to make over my right in the property to\r\nyou." Then they walked on over the Fell for some minutes without\r\nspeaking. They were still on the same path,--that path which Kate and\r\nAlice had taken in the winter,--and now poor Kate could not but think\r\nof all that she had said that day on George\'s behalf;--how had she\r\nmingled truth and falsehood in her efforts to raise her brother\'s\r\ncharacter in her cousin\'s eyes! It had all been done in vain. At\r\nthis very moment of her own trouble Kate thought of John Grey, and\r\nrepented of what she had done. Her hopes in that direction were\r\naltogether blasted. She knew that her brother had ill-treated Alice,\r\nand that she must tell him so if Alice\'s name were mentioned between\r\nthem. She could no longer worship her brother, and hold herself at\r\nhis command in all things. But, as regarded the property to which he\r\nwas naturally the heir, if any act of hers could give it to him, that\r\nact would be done. "If the will is as you say, George, I will make\r\nover my right to you."\r\n\r\n"You can make over nothing," he answered. "The old robber has been\r\ntoo cunning for that; he has left it all in the hands of my uncle\r\nJohn. D---- him. D---- them both."\r\n\r\n"George! George! he is dead now."\r\n\r\n"Dead; of course he is dead. What of that? I wish he had been dead\r\nten years ago,--or twenty. Do you suppose I am to forgive him because\r\nhe is dead? I\'ll heap his grave with curses, if that can be of avail\r\nto punish him."\r\n\r\n"You can only punish the living that way."\r\n\r\n"And I will punish them;--but not by cursing them. My uncle John\r\nshall have such a life of it for the next year or two that he shall\r\nbitterly regret the hour in which he has stepped between me and my\r\nrights."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe that he has done so."\r\n\r\n"Not done so! What was he down here for at Christmas? Do you pretend\r\nto think that that make-believe will was concocted without his\r\nknowledge?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure that he knew nothing of it. I don\'t think my grandfather\'s\r\nmind was made up a week before he died."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to swear that, remember, in a court. I\'m not going to\r\nlet the matter rest, I can tell you. You\'ll have to prove that. How\r\nlong is it since he asked you what you would do with the estate if he\r\nleft it to you?"\r\n\r\nKate thought for a moment before she answered. "It was only two days\r\nbefore he died, if I remember rightly."\r\n\r\n"But you must remember rightly. You\'ll have to swear to it. And now\r\ntell me this honestly; do you believe, in your heart, that he was in\r\na condition fit for making a will?"\r\n\r\n"I advised him not to make it."\r\n\r\n"Why? why? What reason did you give?"\r\n\r\n"I told him that I thought no man should alter family arrangements\r\nwhen he was so ill."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. You told him that. And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He was very angry, and made me send for Mr. Gogram."\r\n\r\n"Now, Kate, think a little before you answer me again. If ever you\r\nare to do me a good turn, you must do it now. And remember this, I\r\ndon\'t at all want to take anything away from you. Whatever you think\r\nis fair you shall have."\r\n\r\nHe was a fool not to have known her better than that.\r\n\r\n"I want nothing," she said, stopping, and stamping with her foot upon\r\nthe crushed heather. "George, you don\'t understand what it is to be\r\nhonest."\r\n\r\nHe smiled,--with a slight provoking smile that passed very rapidly\r\nfrom his face. The meaning of the smile was to be read, had Kate been\r\ncalm enough to read it. "I can\'t say that I do." That was the meaning\r\nof the smile. "Well, never mind about that," said he; "you advised my\r\ngrandfather not to make his will,--thinking, no doubt, that his mind\r\nwas not clear enough?"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment again before she answered him. "His mind was\r\nclear," she said; "but I thought that he should not trust his\r\njudgement while he was so weak."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Kate; I do believe that you at any rate have no mind\r\nto assist in this robbery. That it is a robbery you can\'t have any\r\ndoubt. I said he had left the estate to you. That is not what he has\r\ndone. He has left the estate to my uncle John."\r\n\r\n"Why tell me, then, what was untrue?"\r\n\r\n"Are you disappointed?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I am; uncle John won\'t give it you. George, I don\'t\r\nunderstand you; I don\'t, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about that, but listen to me. The estate is left in the\r\nhands of John Vavasor; but he has left you five hundred a year out of\r\nit till somebody is twenty-five years old who is not yet born, and\r\nprobably never will be born. The will itself shows the old fool to\r\nhave been mad."\r\n\r\n"He was no more mad than you are, George."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, I tell you. I don\'t mean that he was a raging maniac.\r\nNow, you had advised him not to make any new will because you thought\r\nhe was not in a fit condition?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did."\r\n\r\n"You can swear to that?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I may not be called on to do so. I hope there may be no\r\nswearing about it. But if I am asked the question I must swear it."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. Now listen till you understand what it is I mean. That\r\nwill, if it stands, gives all the power over the estate to John\r\nVavasor. It renders you quite powerless as regards any help\r\nor assistance that you might be disposed to give to me. But,\r\nnevertheless, your interest under the will is greater than his,--or\r\nthan that of any one else,--for your son would inherit if I have\r\nnone. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think so."\r\n\r\n"And your testimony as to the invalidity of the will would be\r\nconclusive against all the world."\r\n\r\n"I would say in a court what I have told you, if that will do any\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"It will not be enough. Look here, Kate; you must be steadfast here;\r\neverything depends on you. How often have you told me that you will\r\nstick to me throughout life? Now you will be tried."\r\n\r\nKate felt that her repugnance towards him,--towards all that he was\r\ndoing and wished her to do,--was growing stronger within her at every\r\nword he spoke. She was becoming gradually aware that he desired from\r\nher something which she could not and would not do, and she was aware\r\nalso that in refusing him she would have to encounter him in all his\r\nwrath. She set her teeth firmly together, and clenched her little\r\nfist. If a fight was necessary, she would fight with him. As he\r\nlooked at her closely with his sinister eyes, her love towards him\r\nwas almost turned to hatred.\r\n\r\n"But that was what you meant when you advised him not to make the\r\nwill because you thought his intellect was impaired!"\r\n\r\n"No; not so."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Kate, stop. If you will think of it, It was so. What is the\r\nmeaning of his judgement being weak?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say his judgement was weak."\r\n\r\n"But that was what you meant when you advised him not to trust it!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, George; I think I know now what you mean. If anybody asks\r\nme if his mind was gone, or his intellect deranged, I cannot say that\r\nthere was anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"You will not?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. It would be untrue."\r\n\r\n"Then you are determined to throw me over and claim the property for\r\nyourself." Again he turned towards and looked at her as though he\r\nwere resolved to frighten her. "And I am to count you also among my\r\nenemies? You had better take care, Kate."\r\n\r\nThey were now upon the fell side, more than three miles away from the\r\nHall; and Kate, as she looked round, saw that they were all alone.\r\nNot a cottage,--not a sign of humanity was within sight. Kate saw\r\nthat it was so, and was aware that the fact pressed itself upon her\r\nas being of importance. Then she thought again of her resolution\r\nto fight with him, if any fight were necessary; to tell him, in so\r\nmany words, that she would separate herself from him and defy him.\r\nShe would not fear him, let his words and face be ever so terrible!\r\nSurely her own brother would do her no bodily harm. And even though\r\nhe should do so,--though he should take her roughly by the arm as he\r\nhad done to Alice,--though he should do worse than that, still she\r\nwould fight him. Her blood was the same as his, and he should know\r\nthat her courage was, at any rate, as high.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, when she looked at him, she had cause to fear. He\r\nintended that she should fear. He intended that she should dread what\r\nhe might do to her at that moment. As to what he would do he had no\r\nresolve made. Neither had he resolved on anything when he had gone to\r\nAlice and had shaken her rudely as she sat beside him. He had been\r\nguided by no fixed intent when he had attacked John Grey, or when\r\nhe insulted the attorney; but a Fury was driving him, and he was\r\nconscious of being so driven. He almost wished to be driven to some\r\nact of frenzy. Everything in the world had gone against him, and he\r\ndesired to expend his rage on some one.\r\n\r\n"Kate," said he, stopping her, "we will have this out here, if you\r\nplease. So much, at any rate, shall be settled to-day. You have made\r\nmany promises to me, and I have believed them. You can now keep them\r\nall, by simply saying what you know to be the truth,--that that old\r\nman was a drivelling idiot when he made this will. Are you prepared\r\nto do me that justice? Think before you answer me, for, by G----, if\r\nI cannot have justice among you, I will have revenge." And he put his\r\nhand upon her breast up near to her throat.\r\n\r\n"Take your hand down, George," said she. "I\'m not such a fool that\r\nyou can frighten me in that way."\r\n\r\n"Answer me!" he said, and shook her, having some part of her raiment\r\nwithin his clutch.\r\n\r\n"Oh, George, that I should live to be so ashamed of my brother!"\r\n\r\n"Answer me," he said again; and again he shook her.\r\n\r\n"I have answered you. I will say nothing of the kind that you want\r\nme to say. My grandfather, up to the latest moment that I saw him,\r\nknew what he was about. He was not an idiot. He was, I believe, only\r\ncarrying out a purpose fixed long before. You will not make me change\r\nwhat I say by looking at me like that, nor get it by shaking me.\r\nYou don\'t know me, George, if you think you can frighten me like a\r\nchild."\r\n\r\nHe heard her to the last word, still keeping his hand upon her, and\r\nholding her by the cloak she wore; but the violence of his grasp had\r\nrelaxed itself, and he let her finish her words, as though his object\r\nhad simply been to make her speak out to him what she had to say.\r\n"Oh," said he, when she had done, "That\'s to be it; is it? That\'s\r\nyour idea of honesty. The very name of the money being your own\r\nhas been too much for you. I wonder whether you and my uncle had\r\ncontrived it all between you beforehand?"\r\n\r\n"You will not dare to ask him, because he is a man," said Kate, her\r\neyes brimming with tears, not through fear, but in very vexation at\r\nthe nature of the charge he had brought against her.\r\n\r\n"Shall I not? You will see what I dare do. As for you, with all your\r\npromises--. Kate, you know that I keep my word. Say that you will do\r\nas I desire you, or I will be the death of you."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you will murder me?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Murder you! yes; why not? Treated as I have been among you, do you\r\nsuppose that I shall stick at anything? Why should I not murder\r\nyou--you and Alice, too, seeing how you have betrayed me?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Alice!" As she spoke the words she looked straight into his\r\neyes, as though defying him, as far as she herself were concerned.\r\n\r\n"Poor Alice, indeed! D---- hypocrite! There\'s a pair of you; cursed,\r\nwhining, false, intriguing hypocrites. There; go down and tell your\r\nuncle and that old woman there that I threatened to murder you. Tell\r\nthe judge so, when you\'re brought into court to swear me out of my\r\nproperty. You false liar!" Then he pushed her from him with great\r\nviolence, so that she fell heavily upon the stony ground.\r\n\r\nHe did not stop to help her up, or even to look at her as she lay,\r\nbut walked away across the heath, neither taking the track on towards\r\nHaweswater, nor returning by the path which had brought them thither.\r\nHe went away northwards across the wild fell; and Kate, having risen\r\nup and seated herself on a small cairn of stones which stood there,\r\nwatched him as he descended the slope of the hill till he was out\r\nof sight. He did not run, but he seemed to move rapidly, and he\r\nnever once turned round to look at her. He went away, down the hill\r\nnorthwards, and presently the curving of the ground hid him from her\r\nview.\r\n\r\nWhen she first seated herself her thoughts had been altogether of\r\nhim. She had feared no personal injury, even when she had asked him\r\nwhether he would murder her. Her blood had been hot within her veins,\r\nand her heart had been full of defiance. Even yet she feared nothing,\r\nbut continued to think of him and his misery, and his disgrace. That\r\nhe was gone for ever, utterly and irretrievably ruined, thrown out,\r\nas it were, beyond the pale of men, was now certain to her. And this\r\nwas the brother in whom she had believed; for whom she had not only\r\nbeen willing to sacrifice herself, but for whose purposes she had\r\nstriven to sacrifice her cousin! What would he do now? As he passed\r\nfrom out of her sight down the hill, it seemed to her as though he\r\nwere rushing straight into some hell from which there could be no\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kate.]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe knew that her arm had been hurt in the fall, but for a while she\r\nwould not move it or feel it, being resolved to take no account of\r\nwhat might have happened to herself. But when he had been gone some\r\nten minutes, she rose to her feet, and finding that the movement\r\npained her greatly, and that her right arm was powerless, she put up\r\nher left hand and became aware that the bone of her arm was broken\r\nbelow the elbow. Her first thought was given to the telling him of\r\nthis, or the not telling, when she should meet him below at the\r\nhouse. How should she mention the accident to him? Should she lie,\r\nand say that she had fallen as she came down the hill alone? Of\r\ncourse he would not believe her, but still some such excuse as that\r\nmight make the matter easier for them all. It did not occur to her\r\nthat she might not see him again at all that day; and that, as far as\r\nhe was concerned, there might be need for no lie.\r\n\r\nShe started off to walk down home, holding her right arm steadily\r\nagainst her body with her left hand. Of course she must give some\r\naccount of herself when she got to the house; but it was of the\r\naccount to be given to him that she thought. As to the others she\r\ncared little for them. "Here I am; my arm is broken; and you had\r\nbetter send for a doctor." That would be sufficient for them.\r\n\r\nWhen she got into the wood the path was very dark. The heavens were\r\novercast with clouds, and a few drops began to fall. Then the rain\r\nfell faster and faster, and before she had gone a quarter of a mile\r\ndown the beacon hill, the clouds had opened themselves, and the\r\nshower had become a storm of water. Suffering as she was she stood up\r\nfor a few moments under a large tree, taking the excuse of the rain\r\nfor some minutes of delay, that she might make up her mind as to what\r\nshe would say. Then it occurred to her that she might possibly meet\r\nhim again before she reached the house; and, as she thought of it,\r\nshe began for the first time to fear him. Would he come out upon her\r\nfrom the trees and really kill her? Had he made his way round, when\r\nhe got out of her sight, that he might fall upon her suddenly and do\r\nas he had threatened? As the idea came upon her, she made a little\r\nattempt to run, but she found that running was impracticable from the\r\npain the movement caused her. Then she walked on through the hard\r\nrain, steadily holding her arm against her side, but still looking\r\nevery moment through the trees on the side from which George might be\r\nexpected to reach her. But no one came near her on her way homewards.\r\nHad she been calm enough to think of the nature of the ground, she\r\nmight have known that he could not have returned upon her so quickly.\r\nHe must have come back up the steep hill-side which she had seen him\r\ndescend. No;--he had gone away altogether, across the fells towards\r\nBampton, and was at this moment vainly buttoning his coat across his\r\nbreast, in his unconscious attempt to keep out the wet. The Fury was\r\ndriving him on, and he himself was not aware whither he was driven.\r\n\r\nDinner at the Hall had been ordered at five, the old hour; or rather\r\nthat had been assumed to be the hour for dinner without any ordering.\r\nIt was just five when Kate reached the front door. This she opened\r\nwith her left hand, and turning at once into the dining-room, found\r\nher uncle and her aunt standing before the fire.\r\n\r\n"Dinner is ready," said John Vavasor; "where is George?"\r\n\r\n"You are wet, Kate," said aunt Greenow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am very wet," said Kate. "I must go up-stairs. Perhaps you\'ll\r\ncome with me, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Come with you,--of course I will." Aunt Greenow had seen at once\r\nthat something was amiss.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s George?" said John Vavasor. "Has he come back with you, or\r\nare we to wait for him?"\r\n\r\nKate seated herself in her chair. "I don\'t quite know where he is,"\r\nshe said. In the meantime her aunt had hastened up to her side just\r\nin time to catch her as she was falling from her chair. "My arm,"\r\nsaid Kate, very gently; "my arm!" Then she slipped down against her\r\naunt, and had fainted.\r\n\r\n"He has done her a mischief," said Mrs. Greenow, looking up at her\r\nbrother. "This is his doing."\r\n\r\nJohn Vavasor stood confounded, wishing himself back in Queen Anne\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nShowing How the Wild Beast Got Himself Back from the Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock on that night,--the night of the day on which\r\nKate Vavasor\'s arm had been broken,--there came a gentle knock at\r\nKate\'s bedroom door. There was nothing surprising in this, as of all\r\nthe household Kate only was in bed. Her aunt was sitting at this time\r\nby her bedside, and the doctor, who had been summoned from Penrith\r\nand who had set her broken arm, was still in the house, talking\r\nover the accident with John Vavasor in the dining-room, before he\r\nproceeded back on his journey home.\r\n\r\n"She will do very well," said the doctor. "It\'s only a simple\r\nfracture. I\'ll see her the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Is it not odd that such an accident should come from a fall whilst\r\nwalking?" asked Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. "One never can say how anything\r\nmay occur," said he. "I know a young woman who broke the os femoris\r\nby just kicking her cat;--at least, she said she did."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I suppose you didn\'t take any trouble to inquire?"\r\n\r\n"Not much. My business was with the injury, not with the way she got\r\nit. Somebody did make inquiry, but she stuck to her story and nothing\r\ncame of it. Good night, Mr. Vavasor. Don\'t trouble her with questions\r\ntill she has had some hours\' sleep, at any rate." Then the doctor\r\nwent, and John Vavasor was left alone, standing with his back to the\r\ndining-room fire.\r\n\r\nThere had been so much trouble and confusion in the house since Kate\r\nhad fainted, almost immediately upon her reaching home, that Mr.\r\nVavasor had not yet had time to make up his mind as to the nature of\r\nthe accident which had occurred. Mrs. Greenow had at once ascertained\r\nthat the bone was broken, and the doctor had been sent for. Luckily\r\nhe had been found at home, and had reached the Hall a little before\r\nten o\'clock. In the meantime, as soon as Kate recovered her senses,\r\nshe volunteered her account of what had occurred.\r\n\r\nHer brother had quarrelled with her about the will, she said, and had\r\nleft her abruptly on the mountain. She had fallen, she went on to\r\nsay, as she turned from him, and had at once found that she had hurt\r\nherself. But she had been too angry with him to let him know it; and,\r\nindeed, she had not known the extent herself till he had passed out\r\nof her sight. This was her story; and there was nothing in it that\r\nwas false by the letter, though there was much that was false in the\r\nspirit. It was certainly true that George had not known that she was\r\ninjured. It was true that she had asked him for no help. It was true,\r\nin one sense, that she had fallen, and it was true that she had not\r\nherself known how severe had been the injury done to her till he had\r\ngone beyond the reach of her voice. But she repressed all mention\r\nof his violence, and when she was pressed as to the nature of the\r\nquarrel, she declined to speak further on that matter.\r\n\r\nNeither her uncle nor her aunt believed her. That was a matter of\r\ncourse, and she knew that they did not believe her. George\'s absence,\r\ntheir recent experience of his moods, and the violence by which her\r\narm must have been broken, made them certain that Kate had more to\r\ntell if she chose to tell it. But in her present condition they could\r\nnot question her. Mrs. Greenow did ask as to the probability of her\r\nnephew\'s return.\r\n\r\n"I can only tell you," said Kate, "that he went away across the Fell\r\nin the direction of Bampton. Perhaps he has gone on to Penrith. He\r\nwas very angry with us all; and as the house is not his own, he has\r\nprobably resolved that he will not stay another night under the roof.\r\nBut, who can say? He is not in his senses when he is angered."\r\n\r\nJohn Vavasor, as he stood alone after the doctor\'s departure,\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the truth by thinking of it. "I am sure,"\r\nhe said to himself, "that the doctor suspects that there has been\r\nviolence. I know it from his tone, and I can see it in his eye. But\r\nhow to prove it? and would there be good in proving it? Poor girl!\r\nWill it not be better for her to let it pass as though we believed\r\nher story?" He made up his mind that it would be better. Why should\r\nhe take upon himself the terrible task of calling this insane\r\nrelation to account for an act which he could not prove? The will\r\nitself, without that trouble, would give him trouble enough. Then he\r\nbegan to long that he was back at his club, and to think that the\r\nsigning-room in Chancery Lane was not so bad. And so he went up to\r\nhis bed, calling at Kate\'s door to ask after the patient.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there had come a messenger to Mrs. Greenow, who had\r\nstationed herself with her niece. One of the girls of the house\r\nbrought up a scrap of paper to the door, saying that a boy had\r\nbrought it over with a cart from Shap, and that it was intended for\r\nMiss Vavasor, and it was she who knocked at the sickroom door. The\r\nnote was open and was not addressed; indeed, the words were written\r\non a scrap of paper that was crumpled up rather than folded, and were\r\nas follows: "Send me my clothes by the bearer. I shall not return to\r\nthe house." Mrs. Greenow took it in to Kate, and then went away to see\r\nher nephew\'s things duly put into his portmanteau. This was sent away\r\nin the cart, and Mr. Vavasor, as he went up-stairs, was told what had\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\nNeither on that night or on the following day did Mrs. Greenow ask any\r\nfurther questions; but on the morning after that, when the doctor had\r\nleft them with a good account of the broken limb, her curiosity would\r\nbrook no further delay. And, indeed, indignation as well as curiosity\r\nurged her on. In disposition she was less easy, and, perhaps, less\r\nselfish, than her brother. If it were the case that that man had\r\nill-treated his sister, she would have sacrificed much to bring him\r\nto punishment. "Kate," she said, when the doctor was gone, "I expect\r\nthat you will tell me the whole truth as to what occurred between you\r\nand your brother when you had this accident."\r\n\r\n"I have told you the truth."\r\n\r\n"But not the whole truth."\r\n\r\n"All the truth I mean to tell, aunt. He has quarrelled with me, as I\r\nthink, most unnecessarily, but you don\'t suppose that I am going to\r\ngive an exact account of the quarrel? We were both wrong, probably,\r\nand so let there be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Was he violent to you when he quarrelled with you?"\r\n\r\n"When he is angry he is always violent in his language."\r\n\r\n"But, did he strike you?"\r\n\r\n"Dear aunt, don\'t be angry with me if I say that I won\'t be\r\ncross-examined. I would rather answer no more questions about it.\r\nI know that questioning can do no good."\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow knew her niece well enough to be aware that nothing\r\nmore would be told her, but she was quite sure now that Kate had not\r\nbroken her arm by a simple fall. She was certain that the injury had\r\ncome from positive violence. Had it not been so, Kate would not have\r\ncontented herself with refusing to answer the last question that had\r\nbeen asked, but would also have repelled the charge made against her\r\nbrother with indignation.\r\n\r\n"You must have it your own way," said Mrs. Greenow; "but let me just\r\ntell you this, that your brother George had better keep out of my\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"It is probable that he will," said Kate. "Especially if you remain\r\nhere to nurse me."\r\n\r\nKate\'s conduct in answering all the questions made to her was not\r\ndifficult, but she found that there was much difficulty in planning\r\nher own future behaviour towards her own brother. Must she abandon\r\nhim altogether from henceforth; divide herself from him, as it were;\r\nhave perfectly separate interests, and interests that were indeed\r\nhostile? and must she see him ruined and overwhelmed by want of\r\nmoney, while she had been made a rich woman by her grandfather\'s\r\nwill? It will be remembered that her life had hitherto been devoted\r\nto him; that all her schemes and plans had had his success as their\r\nobject; that she had taught herself to consider it to be her duty to\r\nsacrifice everything to his welfare. It is very sad to abandon the\r\nonly object of a life! It is very hard to tear out from one\'s heart\r\nand fling away from it the only love that one has cherished! What was\r\nshe to say to Alice about all this--to Alice whom she had cheated of\r\na husband worthy of her, that she might allure her into the arms of\r\none so utterly unworthy? Luckily for Kate, her accident was of such a\r\nnature that any writing to Alice was now out of the question.\r\n\r\nBut a blow! What woman can bear a blow from a man, and afterwards\r\nreturn to him with love? A wife may have to bear it and to return.\r\nAnd she may return with that sort of love which is a thing of custom.\r\nThe man is the father of her children, and earns the bread which they\r\neat and which she eats. Habit and the ways of the world require that\r\nshe should be careful in his interests, and that she should live with\r\nhim in what amity is possible to them. But as for love,--all that we\r\nmean by love when we speak of it and write of it,--a blow given by\r\nthe defender to the defenceless crushes it all! A woman may forgive\r\ndeceit, treachery, desertion,--even the preference given to a rival.\r\nShe may forgive them and forget them; but I do not think that a woman\r\ncan forget a blow. And as for forgiveness,--it is not the blow that\r\nshe cannot forgive, but the meanness of spirit that made it possible.\r\n\r\nKate, as she thought of it, told herself that everything in life was\r\nover for her. She had long feared her brother\'s nature,--had feared\r\nthat he was hard and heartless; but still there had been some hope\r\nwith her fear. Success, if he could be made to achieve it, would\r\nsoften him, and then all might be right. But now all was wrong, and\r\nshe knew that it was so. When he had compelled her to write to Alice\r\nfor money, her faith in him had almost succumbed. That had been very\r\nmean, and the meanness had shocked her. But now he had asked her to\r\nperjure herself that he might have his own way, and had threatened\r\nto murder her, and had raised his hand against her because she\r\nhad refused to obey him. And he had accused her of treachery to\r\nhimself,--had accused her of premeditated deceit in obtaining this\r\nproperty for herself!\r\n\r\n"But he does not believe it," said Kate to herself. "He said that\r\nbecause he thought it would vex me; but I know he does not think it."\r\nKate had watched her brother longing for money all his life,--had\r\nthoroughly understood the intensity of his wish for it,--the agony\r\nof his desire. But so far removed was she from any such longing on\r\nher own account, that she could not believe that her brother would in\r\nhis heart accuse her of it. How often had she offered to give him, on\r\nthe instant, every shilling that she had in the world! At this moment\r\nshe resolved, in her mind, that she never wished to see him more; but\r\neven now, had it been practicable, she would have made over to him,\r\nwithout any drawback, all her interest in the Vavasor estate.\r\n\r\nBut any such making over was impossible. John Vavasor remained in\r\nWestmoreland for a week, and during that time many discussions were,\r\nof course, held about the property. Mr. Round came down from London,\r\nand met Mr. Gogram at Penrith. As to the validity of the will Mr. Round\r\nsaid that there was no shadow of a doubt. So an agent was appointed\r\nfor receiving the rents, and it was agreed that the old Hall should\r\nbe let in six months from that date. In the meantime Kate was to\r\nremain there till her arm should become strong, and she could make\r\nher plans for the future. Aunt Greenow promised to remain at the Hall\r\nfor the present, and offered, indeed, indefinite services for the\r\nfuture, as though she were quite forgetful of Captain Bellfield. Of\r\nMr. Cheesacre she was not forgetful, for she still continued to speak\r\nof that gentleman to Kate, as though he were Kate\'s suitor. But she\r\ndid not now press upon her niece the acceptance of Mr. Cheesacre\'s\r\nhand as an absolute duty. Kate was mistress of a considerable\r\nfortune, and though such a marriage might be comfortable, it was no\r\nlonger necessary. Mrs. Greenow called him poor Cheesacre, pointing\r\nout how easily he might be managed, and how indubitable were his\r\npossessions; but she no longer spoke of Kate\'s chances in the\r\nmarriage market as desperate, even though she should decline the\r\nCheesacre alliance.\r\n\r\n"A young woman, with six hundred a year, my dear, may do pretty\r\nnearly what she pleases," said aunt Greenow. "It\'s better than having\r\nten years\' grace given you."\r\n\r\n"And will last longer, certainly," said Kate.\r\n\r\nKate\'s desire was that Alice should come down to her for a while in\r\nWestmoreland, before the six months were over, and this desire she\r\nmentioned to her uncle. He promised to carry the message up to Alice,\r\nbut could not be got to say more than that upon the subject. Then Mr.\r\nVavasor went away, leaving the aunt and niece together at the Hall.\r\n\r\n"What on earth shall we do if that wild beast shows himself suddenly\r\namong us women?" asked Mrs. Greenow of her brother.\r\n\r\nThe brother could only say, "that he hoped the wild beast would keep\r\nhis distance."\r\n\r\nAnd the wild beast did keep his distance, at any rate as long as Mrs.\r\nGreenow remained at the Hall. We will now go back to the wild beast,\r\nand tell how he walked across the mountains, in the rain, to Bampton,\r\na little village at the foot of Haweswater. It will be remembered\r\nthat after he had struck his sister, he turned away from her, and\r\nwalked with quick steps down the mountain-side, never turning back\r\nto look at her. He had found himself to be without any power of\r\npersuasion over her, as regarded her evidence to be given, if the\r\nwill were questioned. The more he threatened her the steadier she had\r\nbeen in asserting her belief in her grandfather\'s capacity. She had\r\nlooked into his eye and defied him, and he had felt himself to be\r\nworsted. What was he to do? In truth, there was nothing for him to\r\ndo. He had told her that he would murder her; and in the state of\r\nmind to which his fury had driven him, murder had suggested itself\r\nto him as a resource to which he might apply himself. But what could\r\nhe gain by murdering her,--or, at any rate, by murdering her then,\r\nout on the mountain-side? Nothing but a hanging! There would be\r\nno gratification even to his revenge. If, indeed, he had murdered\r\nthat old man, who was now, unfortunately, gone beyond the reach of\r\nmurder;--if he could have poisoned the old man\'s cup before that last\r\nwill had been made--there might have been something in such a deed!\r\nBut he had merely thought of it, letting "I dare not wait upon I\r\nwould"--as he now told himself, with much self-reproach. Nothing was\r\nto be got by killing his sister. So he restrained himself in his\r\npassion, and walked away from her, solitary, down the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe rain soon came on, and found him exposed on the hill-side. He\r\nthought little about it, but buttoned his coat, as I have said\r\nbefore, and strode on. It was a storm of rain, so that he was forced\r\nto hold his head to one side, as it hit him from the north. But with\r\nhis hand to his hat, and his head bent against the wind, he went on\r\ntill he had reached the valley at the foot, and found that the track\r\nby which he had been led thither had become a road. He had never\r\nknown the mountains round the Hall as Kate had known them, and was\r\nnot aware whither he was going. On one thing only had he made up his\r\nmind since he had left his sister, and that was that he would not\r\nreturn to the house. He knew that he could do nothing there to serve\r\nhis purpose; his threats would be vain impotence; he had no longer\r\nany friend in the house. He could hardly tell himself what line of\r\nconduct he would pursue, but he thought that he would hurry back\r\nto London, and grasp at whatever money he could get from Alice. He\r\nwas still, at this moment, a Member of Parliament; and as the rain\r\ndrenched him through and through, he endeavoured to get consolation\r\nfrom the remembrance of that fact in his favour.\r\n\r\nAs he got near the village he overtook a shepherd boy coming down\r\nfrom the hills, and learned his whereabouts from him. "Baampton,"\r\nsaid the boy, with an accent that was almost Scotch, when he was\r\nasked the name of the place. When Vavasor further asked whether a\r\ngig were kept there, the boy simply stared at him, not knowing a\r\ngig by that name. At last, however, he was made to understand the\r\nnature of his companion\'s want, and expressed his belief that "John\r\nApplethwaite, up at the Craigs yon, had got a mickle cart." But the\r\nCraigs was a farm-house, which now came in view about a mile off, up\r\nacross the valley; and Vavasor, hoping that he might still find a\r\nspeedier conveyance than John Applethwaite\'s mickle cart, went on to\r\nthe public-house in the village. But, in truth, neither there, nor\r\nyet from John Applethwaite, to whom at last an application was sent,\r\ncould he get any vehicle; and between six and seven he started off\r\nagain, through the rain, to make his weary way on foot to Shap. The\r\ndistance was about five miles, and the little byways, lying between\r\nwalls, were sticky, and almost glutinous with light-coloured, chalky\r\nmud. Before he started he took a glass of hot rum-and-water, but the\r\neffect of that soon passed away from him, and then he became colder\r\nand weaker than he had been before.\r\n\r\nWearily and wretchedly he plodded on. A man may be very weary in such\r\na walk as that, and yet be by no means wretched. Tired, hungry, cold,\r\nwet, and nearly penniless, I have sat me down and slept among those\r\nmountain tracks,--have slept because nature refused to allow longer\r\nwakefulness. But my heart has been as light as my purse, and there\r\nhas been something in the air of the hills that made me buoyant and\r\nhappy in the midst of my weariness. But George Vavasor was wretched\r\nas well as weary, and every step that he took, plodding through the\r\nmud, was a new misfortune to him. What are five miles of a walk to\r\na young man, even though the rain be falling and the ways be dirty?\r\nwhat, though they may come after some other ten that he has already\r\ntraversed on his feet? His sister Kate would have thought nothing\r\nof the distance. But George stopped on his way from time to time,\r\nleaning on the loose walls, and cursing the misfortune that had\r\nbrought him to such a pass. He cursed his grandfather, his uncle, his\r\nsister, his cousin, and himself. He cursed the place in which his\r\nforefathers had lived, and he cursed the whole county. He cursed the\r\nrain, and the wind, and his town-made boots, which would not keep\r\nout the wet slush. He cursed the light as it faded, and the darkness\r\nas it came. Over and over again he cursed the will that had robbed\r\nhim, and the attorney that had made it. He cursed the mother that\r\nhad borne him and the father that had left him poor. He thought\r\nof Scruby, and cursed him, thinking how that money would be again\r\nrequired of him by that stern agent. He cursed the House of Commons,\r\nwhich had cost him so much, and the greedy electors who would not\r\nsend him there without his paying for it. He cursed John Grey, as he\r\nthought of those two thousand pounds, with double curses. He cursed\r\nthis world, and all worlds beyond; and thus, cursing everything, he\r\nmade his way at last up to the inn at Shap.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine when he got there. He had wasted over an hour at\r\nBampton in his endeavour to get John Applethwaite\'s cart to carry him\r\non, and he had been two hours on his walk from Bampton to Shap,--two\r\nhours amidst his cursing. He ordered supper and brandy-and-water,\r\nand, as we know, sent off a Mercury for his clothes. But the\r\nMercuries of Westmoreland do not move on quick wings, and it was past\r\nmidnight before he got his possessions. During all this time he had,\r\nby no means, ceased from cursing, but continued it over his broiled\r\nham and while he swallowed his brandy-and-water. He swore aloud, so\r\nthat the red-armed servant at the inn could not but hear him, that\r\nthose thieves at the Hall intended to rob him of his clothes;--that\r\nthey would not send him his property. He could not restrain himself,\r\nthough he knew that every word he uttered would injure his cause, as\r\nregarded the property in Westmoreland, if ever he could make a cause.\r\nHe knew that he had been mad to strike his sister, and cursed himself\r\nfor his madness. Yet he could not restrain himself. He told himself\r\nthat the battle for him was over, and he thought of poison for\r\nhimself. He thought of poison, and a pistol,--of the pistols he had\r\never loaded at home, each with six shots, good for a life apiece. He\r\nthought of an express train, rushing along at its full career, and of\r\nthe instant annihilation which it would produce. But if that was to\r\nbe the end of him, he would not go alone. No, indeed! why should he\r\ngo alone, leaving those pistols ready loaded in his desk? Among them\r\nthey had brought him to ruin and to death. Was he a man to pardon his\r\nenemies when it was within his power to take them with him, down,\r\ndown, down--? What were the last words upon his impious lips, as with\r\nbloodshot eyes, half drunk, and driven by the Fury, he took himself\r\noff to the bed prepared for him, cursing aloud the poor red-haired\r\ngirl as he went, I may not utter here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Pallisers at Breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentle reader, do you remember Lady Monk\'s party, and how it\r\nended,--how it ended, at least as regards those special guests with\r\nwhom we are concerned? Mr. Palliser went away early, Mrs. Marsham\r\nfollowed him to his house in Park Lane, caught him at home, and told\r\nher tale. He returned to his wife, found her sitting with Burgo in\r\nthe dining-room, under the Argus eyes of the constant Bott, and bore\r\nher away home. Burgo disappeared utterly from the scene, and Mr. Bott,\r\ncomplaining inwardly that virtue was too frequently allowed to be its\r\nown reward, comforted himself with champagne, and then walked off\r\nto his lodgings. Lady Monk, when Mr. Palliser made his way into her\r\nroom up-stairs, seeking his wife\'s scarf,--which little incident,\r\nalso, the reader may perhaps remember,--saw that the game was up, and\r\nthought with regret of the loss of her two hundred pounds. Such was\r\nthe ending of Lady Monk\'s party.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora, on her journey home in the carriage with her husband,\r\nhad openly suggested that Mrs. Marsham had gone to Park Lane to tell\r\nof her doings with Burgo, and had declared her resolution never again\r\nto see either that lady or Mr. Bott in her own house. This she said\r\nwith more of defiance in her tone than Mr. Palliser had ever hitherto\r\nheard. He was by nature less ready than her, and knowing his own\r\ndeficiency in that respect, abstained from all answer on the subject.\r\nIndeed, during that drive home very few further words were spoken\r\nbetween them. "I will breakfast with you to-morrow," he said to her,\r\nas she prepared to go up-stairs. "I have work still to do to-night,\r\nand I will not disturb you by coming to your room."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t want me to be very early?" said his wife.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, with more of anger in his voice than he had yet shown.\r\n"What hour will suit you? I must say something of what has occurred\r\nto-night before I leave you to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you can have got to say about to-night, but I\'ll\r\nbe down by half-past eleven, if that will do?" Mr. Palliser said that\r\nhe would make it do, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora had played her part very well before her husband. She\r\nhad declined to be frightened by him; had been the first to mention\r\nBurgo\'s name, and had done so with no tremor in her voice, and had\r\nboldly declared her irreconcilable enmity to the male and female\r\nduennas who had dared to take her in charge. While she was in the\r\ncarriage with her husband she felt some triumph in her own strength;\r\nand as she wished him good night on the staircase, and slowly walked\r\nup to her room, without having once lowered her eyes before his,\r\nsomething of this consciousness of triumph still supported her. And\r\neven while her maid remained with her she held herself up, as it\r\nwere, inwardly, telling herself that she would not yield,--that she\r\nwould not be cowed either by her husband or by his spies. But when\r\nshe was left alone all her triumph departed from her.\r\n\r\nShe bade her maid go while she was still sitting in her\r\ndressing-gown; and when the girl was gone she got close over the\r\nfire, sitting with her slippers on the fender, with her elbows on\r\nher knees, and her face resting on her hands. In this position she\r\nremained for an hour, with her eyes fixed on the altering shapes of\r\nthe hot coals. During this hour her spirit was by no means defiant,\r\nand her thoughts of herself anything but triumphant. Mr. Bott and\r\nMrs. Marsham she had forgotten altogether. After all, they were but\r\nbuzzing flies, who annoyed her by their presence. Should she choose\r\nto leave her husband, they could not prevent her leaving him. It was\r\nof her husband and of Burgo that she was thinking,--weighing them one\r\nagainst the other, and connecting her own existence with theirs, not\r\nas expecting joy or the comfort of love from either of them, but with\r\nan assured conviction that on either side there must be misery for\r\nher. But of that shame before all the world which must be hers for\r\never, should she break her vows and consent to live with a man who\r\nwas not her husband, she thought hardly at all. That which in the\r\nestimation of Alice was everything, to her, at this moment, was\r\nalmost nothing. For herself, she had been sacrificed; and,--as she\r\ntold herself with bitter denunciations against herself,--had been\r\nsacrificed through her own weakness. But that was done. Whatever way\r\nshe might go, she was lost. They had married her to a man who cared\r\nnothing for a wife, nothing for any woman,--so at least she declared\r\nto herself,--but who had wanted a wife that he might have an heir.\r\nHad it been given to her to have a child, she thought that she might\r\nhave been happy,--sufficiently happy in sharing her husband\'s joy in\r\nthat respect. But everything had gone against her. There was nothing\r\nin her home to give her comfort. "He looks at me every time he\r\nsees me as the cause of his misfortune," she said to herself. Of\r\nher husband\'s rank, of the future possession of his title and his\r\nestates, she thought much. But of her own wealth she thought nothing.\r\nIt did not occur to her that she had given him enough in that respect\r\nto make his marriage with her a comfort to him. She took it for\r\ngranted that that marriage was now one distasteful to him, as it was\r\nto herself, and that he would eventually be the gainer if she should\r\nso conduct herself that her marriage might be dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady Glencora.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Burgo, I doubt whether she deceived herself much as to his\r\ncharacter. She knew well enough that he was a man infinitely less\r\nworthy than her husband. She knew that he was a spendthrift, idle,\r\ngiven to bad courses,--that he drank, that he gambled, that he lived\r\nthe life of the loosest man about the town. She knew also that\r\nwhatever chance she might have had to redeem him, had she married\r\nhim honestly before all the world, there could be no such chance\r\nif she went to him as his mistress, abandoning her husband and all\r\nher duties, and making herself vile in the eyes of all women. Burgo\r\nFitzgerald would not be influenced for good by such a woman as she\r\nwould then be. She knew much of the world and its ways, and told\r\nherself no lies about this. But, as I have said before, she did not\r\ncount herself for much. What though she were ruined? What though\r\nBurgo were false, mean, and untrustworthy? She loved him, and he was\r\nthe only man she ever had loved! Lower and lower she crouched before\r\nthe fire; and then, when the coals were no longer red, and the shapes\r\naltered themselves no more, she crept into bed. As to what she should\r\nsay to her husband on the following morning,--she had not yet begun\r\nto think of that.\r\n\r\nExactly at half-past eleven she entered the little breakfast parlour\r\nwhich looked out over the park. It was the prettiest room in the\r\nhouse, and now, at this springtide, when the town trees were putting\r\nout their earliest greens, and were fresh and bright almost as\r\ncountry trees, it might be hard to find a prettier chamber. Mr.\r\nPalliser was there already, sitting with the morning paper in his\r\nhand. He rose when she entered, and, coming up to her, just touched\r\nher with his lips. She put her cheek up to him, and then took her\r\nplace at the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n"Have you any headache this morning?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she said. Then he took his tea and his toast, spoke some\r\nword to her about the fineness of the weather, told her some scraps\r\nof news, and soon returned to the absorbing interest of a speech made\r\nby the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. The speech was\r\nvery interesting to Mr. Palliser, because in it the noble lord alluded\r\nto a break-up in the present Cabinet, as to which the rumours were,\r\nhe said, so rife through the country as to have destroyed all that\r\nfeeling of security in the existing Government which the country so\r\nmuch valued and desired. Mr. Palliser had as yet heard no official\r\ntidings of such a rupture; but if such rupture were to take place,\r\nit must be in his favour. He felt himself at this moment to be full\r\nof politics,--to be near the object of his ambition, to have affairs\r\nupon his hands which required all his attention. Was it absolutely\r\nincumbent on him to refer again to the incidents of last night? The\r\ndoing so would be odious to him. The remembrance of the task now\r\nimmediately before him destroyed all his political satisfaction. He\r\ndid not believe that his wife was in any serious danger. Might it not\r\nyet be possible for him to escape from the annoyance, and to wash\r\nhis mind clean of all suspicion? He was not jealous; he was indeed\r\nincapable of jealousy. He knew what it would be to be dishonoured,\r\nand he knew that under certain circumstances the world would expect\r\nhim to exert himself in a certain way. But the thing that he had now\r\nto do was a great trouble to him. He would rather have to address\r\nthe House of Commons with ten columns of figures than utter a word\r\nof remonstrance to his wife. But she had defied him,--defied him\r\nby saying that she would see his friends no more; and it was the\r\nremembrance of this, as he sat behind his newspaper, that made him\r\nultimately feel that he could not pass in silence over what had been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he went on reading, or pretending to read, as long as\r\nthe continuance of the breakfast made it certain that his wife would\r\nremain with him. Every now and then he said some word to her of\r\nwhat he was reading, endeavouring to use the tone of voice that was\r\ncustomary to him in his domestic teachings of politics. But through\r\nit all there was a certain hesitation,--there were the sure signs of\r\nan attempt being made, of which he was himself conscious, and which\r\nshe understood with the most perfect accuracy. He was deferring the\r\nevil moment, and vainly endeavouring to make himself believe that he\r\nwas comfortably employed the while. She had no newspaper, and made no\r\nendeavour to deceive herself. She, therefore, was the first to begin\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet," she said, "you told me last night, as I was going to\r\nbed, that you had something to say about Lady Monk\'s party."\r\n\r\nHe put down the newspaper slowly, and turned towards her. "Yes, my\r\ndear. After what happened, I believe that I must say something."\r\n\r\n"If you think anything, pray say it," said Glencora.\r\n\r\n"It is not always easy for a man to show what he thinks by what he\r\nsays," he replied. "My fear is that you should suppose me to think\r\nmore than I do. And it was for that reason that I determined to sleep\r\non it before I spoke to you."\r\n\r\n"If anybody is angry with me I\'d much rather they should have it out\r\nwith me while their anger is hot. I hate cold anger."\r\n\r\n"But I am not angry."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what husbands always say when they\'re going to scold."\r\n\r\n"But I am not going to scold. I am only going to advise you."\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner be scolded. Advice is to anger just what cold anger is to\r\nhot."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Glencora, surely if I find it necessary to speak--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to stop you, Plantagenet. Pray, go on. Only it will be\r\nso nice to have it over."\r\n\r\nHe was now more than ever averse to the task before him. Husbands,\r\nwhen they give their wives a talking, should do it out of hand,\r\nuttering their words hard, sharp, and quick,--and should then go.\r\nThere are some works that won\'t bear a preface, and this work of\r\nmarital fault-finding is one of them. Mr. Palliser was already\r\nbeginning to find out the truth of this. "Glencora," he said, "I wish\r\nyou to be serious with me."\r\n\r\n"I am very serious," she replied, as she settled herself in her chair\r\nwith an air of mockery, while her eyes and mouth were bright and\r\neloquent with a spirit which her husband did not love to see. Poor\r\ngirl! There was seriousness enough in store for her before she would\r\nbe able to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be serious. Do you know why Mrs. Marsham came here from\r\nLady Monk\'s last night?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. She came to tell you that I was waltzing with Burgo\r\nFitzgerald. You might as well ask me whether I knew why Mr. Bott was\r\nstanding at all the doors, glaring at me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about Mr. Bott."\r\n\r\n"I know something about him though," she said, again moving herself\r\nin her chair.\r\n\r\n"I am speaking now of Mrs. Marsham."\r\n\r\n"You should speak of them both together as they hunt in couples."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, will you listen to me, or will you not? If you say that\r\nyou will not, I shall know what to do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you would, Plantagenet." And she nodded her little\r\nhead at him, as she spoke. "I\'m sure I don\'t know what you would do.\r\nBut I will listen to you. Only, as I said before, it will be very\r\nnice when it\'s over."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Marsham came here, not simply to tell me that you were waltzing\r\nwith Mr. Fitzgerald,--and I wish that when you mention his name you\r\nwould call him Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"So I do."\r\n\r\n"You generally prefix his Christian name, which it would be much\r\nbetter that you should omit."\r\n\r\n"I will try," she said, very gently; "but it\'s hard to drop an old\r\nhabit. Before you married me you knew that I had learned to call him\r\nBurgo."\r\n\r\n"Let me go on," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly."\r\n\r\n"It was not simply to tell me that you were waltzing that Mrs. Marsham\r\ncame here."\r\n\r\n"And it was not simply to see me waltzing that Mr. Bott stood in the\r\ndoorways, for he followed me about, and came down after me to the\r\nsupper-room."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, will you oblige me by not speaking of Mr. Bott?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you would oblige me by not speaking of Mrs. Marsham." Mr.\r\nPalliser rose quickly from his chair with a gesture of anger, stood\r\nupright for half a minute, and then sat down again. "I beg your\r\npardon, Plantagenet," she said. "I think I know what you want, and\r\nI\'ll hold my tongue till you bid me speak."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Marsham came here because she saw that every one in the room\r\nwas regarding you with wonder." Lady Glencora twisted herself about\r\nin her chair, but she said nothing. "She saw that you were not only\r\ndancing with Mr. Fitzgerald, but that you were dancing with him,--what\r\nshall I say?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I can\'t tell you."\r\n\r\n"Recklessly."\r\n\r\n"Oh! recklessly, was I? What was I reckless of?"\r\n\r\n"Reckless of what people might say; reckless of what I might feel\r\nabout it; reckless of your own position."\r\n\r\n"Am I to speak now?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you had better let me go on. I think she was right to come\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s of course. What\'s the good of having spies, if they\r\ndon\'t run and tell as soon as they see anything, especially\r\nanything--reckless."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, you are determined to make me angry. I am angry now,--very\r\nangry. I have employed no spies. When rumours have reached me, not\r\nfrom spies, as you choose to call them, but through your dearest\r\nfriends and mine--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by rumours from my dearest friends?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Let me go on."\r\n\r\n"No; not when you say my dear friends have spread rumours about me.\r\nTell me who they are. I have no dear friends. Do you mean Alice\r\nVavasor?"\r\n\r\n"It does not signify. But when I was warned that you had better not\r\ngo to any house in which you could meet that man, I would not listen\r\nto it. I said that you were my wife, and that as such I could trust\r\nyou anywhere, everywhere, with any person. Others might distrust\r\nyou, but I would not do so. When I wished you to go to Monkshade,\r\nwere there to be any spies there? When I left you last night at Lady\r\nMonk\'s, do you believe in your heart that I trusted to Mrs. Marsham\'s\r\neyes rather than to your own truth? Do you think that I have lived in\r\nfear of Mr. Fitzgerald?"\r\n\r\n"No, Plantagenet; I do not think so."\r\n\r\n"Do you believe that I have commissioned Mr. Bott to watch your\r\nconduct? Answer me, Glencora."\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, thinking what actually was her true belief on\r\nthat subject. "He does watch me, certainly," she said.\r\n\r\n"That does not answer my question. Do you believe that I have\r\ncommissioned him to do so?"\r\n\r\n"No; I do not."\r\n\r\n"Then it is ignoble in you to talk to me of spies. I have employed\r\nno spies. If it were ever to come to that, that I thought spies\r\nnecessary, it would be all over with me."\r\n\r\nThere was something of feeling in his voice as he said\r\nthis,--something that almost approached to passion which touched his\r\nwife\'s heart. Whether or not spies would be of any avail, she knew\r\nthat she had in truth done that of which he had declared that he\r\nhad never suspected her. She had listened to words of love from her\r\nformer lover. She had received, and now carried about with her a\r\nletter from this man, in which he asked her to elope with him. She\r\nhad by no means resolved that she would not do this thing. She had\r\nbeen false to her husband; and as her husband spoke of his confidence\r\nin her, her own spirit rebelled against the deceit which she herself\r\nwas practising.\r\n\r\n"I know that I have never made you happy," she said. "I know that I\r\nnever can make you happy."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, struck by her altered tone, and saw that her whole\r\nmanner and demeanour were changed. "I do not understand what you\r\nmean," he said. "I have never complained. You have not made me\r\nunhappy." He was one of those men to whom this was enough. If his\r\nwife caused him no uneasiness, what more was he to expect from her?\r\nNo doubt she might have done much more for him. She might have given\r\nhim an heir. But he was a just man, and knew that the blank he had\r\ndrawn was his misfortune, and not her fault.\r\n\r\nBut now her heart was loosed and she spoke out, at first slowly,\r\nbut after a while with all the quietness of strong passion. "No,\r\nPlantagenet; I shall never make you happy. You have never loved me,\r\nnor I you. We have never loved each other for a single moment. I have\r\nbeen wrong to talk to you about spies; I was wrong to go to Lady\r\nMonk\'s; I have been wrong in everything that I have done; but never\r\nso wrong as when I let them persuade me to be your wife!"\r\n\r\n"Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"Let me speak now, Plantagenet, It is better that I should tell you\r\neverything; and I will. I will tell you everything;--everything! I do\r\nlove Burgo Fitzgerald. I do! I do! I do! How can I help loving him?\r\nHave I not loved him from the first,--before I had seen you? Did you\r\nnot know that it was so? I do love Burgo Fitzgerald, and when I went\r\nto Lady Monk\'s last night, I had almost made up my mind that I must\r\ntell him so, and that I must go away with him and hide myself. But\r\nwhen he came to speak to me--"\r\n\r\n"He has asked you to go with him, then?" said the husband, in whose\r\nbosom the poison was beginning to take effect, thereby showing that\r\nhe was neither above nor below humanity.\r\n\r\nGlencora was immediately reminded that though she might, if she\r\npleased, tell her own secrets, she ought not, in accordance with her\r\nideas of honour, tell those of her lover. "What need is there of\r\nasking, do you think, when people have loved each other as we have\r\ndone?"\r\n\r\n"You wanted to go with him, then?"\r\n\r\n"Would it not have been the best for you? Plantagenet, I do not love\r\nyou;--not as women love their husbands when they do love them. But,\r\nbefore God, my first wish is to free you from the misfortune that\r\nI have brought on you." As she made this attestation she started up\r\nfrom her chair, and coming close to him, took him by the coat. He was\r\nstartled, and stepped back a pace, but did not speak; and then stood\r\nlooking at her as she went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Before God, my first wish is to free you\r\nfrom the misfortune that I have brought on you."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"What matters it whether I drown myself, or throw myself away by\r\ngoing with such a one as him, so that you might marry again, and\r\nhave a child? I\'d die;--I\'d die willingly. How I wish I could die!\r\nPlantagenet, I would kill myself if I dared."\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man and she was short of stature, so that he stood over\r\nher and looked upon her, and now she was looking up into his face\r\nwith all her eyes. "I would," she said. "I would--I would! What is\r\nthere left for me that I should wish to live?"\r\n\r\nSoftly, slowly, very gradually, as though he were afraid of what he\r\nwas doing, he put his arm round her waist. "You are wrong in one\r\nthing," he said. "I do love you."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, touching his breast with her hair as she did so.\r\n\r\n"I do love you," he repeated. "If you mean that I am not apt at\r\ntelling you so, it is true, I know. My mind is running on other\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said; "your mind is running on other things."\r\n\r\n"But I do love you. If you cannot love me, it is a great misfortune\r\nto us both. But we need not therefore be disgraced. As for that other\r\nthing of which you spoke,--of our having, as yet, no child"--and in\r\nsaying this he pressed her somewhat closer with his arm--"you allow\r\nyourself to think too much of it;--much more of it than I do. I have\r\nmade no complaints on that head, even within my own breast."\r\n\r\n"I know what your thoughts are, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"Believe me that you wrong my thoughts. Of course I have been\r\nanxious, and have, perhaps, shown my anxiety by the struggle I have\r\nmade to hide it. I have never told you what is false, Glencora."\r\n\r\n"No; you are not false!"\r\n\r\n"I would rather have you for my wife, childless,--if you will try to\r\nlove me,--than any other woman, though another might give me an heir.\r\nWill you try to love me?"\r\n\r\nShe was silent. At this moment, after the confession that she had\r\nmade, she could not bring herself to say that she would even try. Had\r\nshe said so, she would have seemed to have accepted his forgiveness\r\ntoo easily.\r\n\r\n"I think, dear," he said, still holding her by her waist, "that we\r\nhad better leave England for a while. I will give up politics for\r\nthis season. Should you like to go to Switzerland for the summer, or\r\nperhaps to some of the German baths, and then on to Italy when the\r\nweather is cold enough?" Still she was silent. "Perhaps your friend,\r\nMiss Vavasor, would go with us?"\r\n\r\nHe was killing her by his goodness. She could not speak to him yet;\r\nbut now, as he mentioned Alice\'s name, she gently put up her hand and\r\nrested it on the back of his.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there came a knock at the door;--a sharp knock, which\r\nwas quickly repeated.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Mr. Palliser, dropping his arm from his wife\'s waist,\r\nand standing away from her a few yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of St. Bungay in Search of a Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the butler who had knocked,--showing that the knock was of\r\nmore importance than it would have been had it been struck by the\r\nknuckles of the footman in livery. "If you please, sir, the Duke of\r\nSt. Bungay is here."\r\n\r\n"The Duke of St. Bungay!" said Mr. Palliser, becoming rather red as he\r\nheard the announcement.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, his grace is in the library. He bade me tell you that he\r\nparticularly wanted to see you; so I told him that you were with my\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"Quite right; tell his grace that I will be with him in two minutes."\r\nThen the butler retired, and Mr. Palliser was again alone with his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"I must go now, my dear," he said; "and perhaps I shall not see you\r\nagain till the evening."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let me put you out in any way," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--you won\'t put me out. You will be dressing, I suppose, about\r\nnine."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean as to that," she answered. "You must not think\r\nmore of Italy. He has come to tell you that you are wanted in the\r\nCabinet."\r\n\r\nAgain he turned very red. "It may be so," he answered, "but though\r\nI am wanted, I need not go. But I must not keep the duke waiting.\r\nGood-bye." And he turned to the door.\r\n\r\nShe followed him and took hold of him as he went, so that he was\r\nforced to turn to her once again. She managed to get hold of both\r\nhis hands, and pressed them closely, looking up into his face with\r\nher eyes laden with tears. He smiled at her gently, returned the\r\npressure of the hands, and then left her,--without kissing her. It\r\nwas not that he was minded not to kiss her. He would have kissed her\r\nwillingly enough had he thought that the occasion required it. "He\r\nsays that he loves me," said Lady Glencora to herself, "but he does\r\nnot know what love means."\r\n\r\nBut she was quite aware that he had behaved to her with genuine, true\r\nnobility. As soon as she was alone and certain of her solitude, she\r\ntook out that letter from her pocket, and tearing it into very small\r\nfragments, without reading it, threw the pieces on the fire. As she\r\ndid so, her mind seemed to be fixed, at any rate, to one thing,--that\r\nshe would think no more of Burgo Fitzgerald as her future master. I\r\nthink, however, that she had arrived at so much certainty as this,\r\nat that moment in which she had been parting with Burgo Fitzgerald,\r\nin Lady Monk\'s dining-room. She had had courage enough,--or shall we\r\nrather say sin enough,--to think of going with him,--to tell herself\r\nthat she would do so; to put herself in the way of doing it; nay, she\r\nhad had enough of both to enable her to tell her husband that she had\r\nresolved that it would be good for her to do so. But she was neither\r\nbold enough nor wicked enough to do the thing. As she had said of her\r\nown idea of destroying herself,--she did not dare to take the plunge.\r\nTherefore, knowing now that it was so, she tore up the letter that\r\nshe had carried so long, and burnt it in the fire.\r\n\r\nShe had in truth told him everything, believing that in doing so she\r\nwas delivering her own death-warrant as regarded her future position\r\nin his house. She had done this, not hoping thereby for any escape;\r\nnot with any purpose as regarded herself, but simply because deceit\r\nhad been grievous to her, and had become unendurable as soon as\r\nhis words and manner had in them any feeling of kindness. But her\r\nconfession had no sooner been made than her fault had been forgiven.\r\nShe had told him that she did not love him. She had told him, even,\r\nthat she had thought of leaving him. She had justified by her own\r\nwords any treatment of his, however harsh, which he might choose\r\nto practise. But the result had been--the immediate result--that\r\nhe had been more tender to her than she had ever remembered him to\r\nbe before. She knew that he had conquered her. However cold and\r\nheartless his home might be to her, it must be her home now. There\r\ncould be no further thought of leaving him. She had gone out into the\r\ntiltyard and had tilted with him, and he had been the victor.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser himself had not time for much thought before he found\r\nhimself closeted with the Duke; but as he crossed the hall and went\r\nup the stairs, a thought or two did pass quickly across his mind. She\r\nhad confessed to him, and he had forgiven her. He did not feel quite\r\nsure that he had been right, but he did feel quite sure that the\r\nthing had been done. He recognized it for a fact that, as regarded\r\nthe past, no more was to be said. There were to be no reproaches,\r\nand there must be some tacit abandoning of Mrs. Marsham\'s close\r\nattendance. As to Mr. Bott;--he had begun to hate Mr. Bott, and had\r\nfelt cruelly ungrateful, when that gentleman endeavoured to whisper a\r\nword into his ear as he passed through the doorway into Lady Monk\'s\r\ndining-room. And he had offered to go abroad,--to go abroad and\r\nleave his politics, and his ambition, and his coming honours. He\r\nhad persisted in his offer, even after his wife had suggested to\r\nhim that the Duke of St. Bungay was now in the house with the object\r\nof offering him that very thing for which he had so longed! As he\r\nthought of this his heart became heavy within him. Such chances,--so\r\nhe told himself,--do not come twice in a man\'s way. When returning\r\nfrom a twelvemonth\'s residence abroad he would be nobody in politics.\r\nHe would have lost everything for which he had been working all his\r\nlife. But he was a man of his word, and as he opened the library door\r\nhe was resolute,--he thought that he could be resolute in adhering to\r\nhis promise.\r\n\r\n"Duke," he said, "I\'m afraid I have kept you waiting." And the two\r\npolitical allies shook each other by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was in a glow of delight. There had been no waiting. He was\r\nonly too glad to find his friend at home. He had been prepared to\r\nwait, even if Mr. Palliser had been out. "And I suppose you guess why\r\nI\'m come?" said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I would rather be told than have to guess," said Mr. Palliser,\r\nsmiling for a moment. But the smile quickly passed off his face as he\r\nremembered his pledge to his wife.\r\n\r\n"He has resigned at last. What was said in the Lords last night made\r\nit necessary that he should do so, or that Lord Brock should declare\r\nhimself able to support him through thick and thin. Of course, I can\r\ntell you everything now. He must have gone, or I must have done so.\r\nYou know that I don\'t like him in the Cabinet. I admire his character\r\nand his genius, but I think him the most dangerous man in England as\r\na statesman. He has high principles,--the very highest; but they are\r\nso high as to be out of sight to ordinary eyes. They are too exalted\r\nto be of any use for everyday purposes. He is honest as the sun, I\'m\r\nsure; but it\'s just like the sun\'s honesty,--of a kind which we men\r\nbelow can\'t quite understand or appreciate. He has no instinct in\r\npolitics, but reaches his conclusions by philosophical deduction.\r\nNow, in politics, I would a deal sooner trust to instinct than to\r\ncalculation. I think he may probably know how England ought to be\r\ngoverned three centuries hence better than any man living, but of the\r\nproper way to govern it now, I think he knows less. Brock half likes\r\nhim and half fears him. He likes the support of his eloquence, and he\r\nlikes the power of the man; but he fears his restless activity, and\r\nthoroughly dislikes his philosophy. At any rate, he has left us, and\r\nI am here to ask you to take his place."\r\n\r\nThe Duke, as he concluded his speech, was quite contented, and\r\nalmost jovial. He was thoroughly satisfied with the new political\r\narrangement which he was proposing. He regarded Mr. Palliser as a\r\nsteady, practical man of business, luckily young, and therefore with\r\na deal of work in him, belonging to the race from which English\r\nministers ought, in his opinion, to be taken, and as being, in some\r\nrespects, his own pupil. He had been the first to declare aloud that\r\nPlantagenet Palliser was the coming Chancellor of the Exchequer; and\r\nit had been long known, though no such declaration had been made\r\naloud, that the Duke did not sit comfortably in the same Cabinet with\r\nthe gentleman who had now resigned. Everything had now gone as the\r\nDuke wished; and he was prepared to celebrate some little ovation\r\nwith his young friend before he left the house in Park Lane.\r\n\r\n"And who goes out with him?" asked Mr. Palliser, putting off the evil\r\nmoment of his own decision; but before the Duke could answer him, he\r\nhad reminded himself that under his present circumstances he had no\r\nright to ask such a question. His own decision could not rest upon\r\nthat point. "But it does not matter," he said; "I am afraid I must\r\ndecline the offer you bring me."\r\n\r\n"Decline it!" said the Duke, who could not have been more surprised\r\nhad his friend talked of declining heaven.\r\n\r\n"I fear I must." The Duke had now risen from his chair, and was\r\nstanding, with both his hands upon the table. All his contentment,\r\nall his joviality, had vanished. His fine round face had become\r\nalmost ludicrously long; his eyes and mouth were struggling to convey\r\nreproach, and the reproach was almost drowned in vexation. Ever since\r\nParliament had met he had been whispering Mr. Palliser\'s name into\r\nthe Prime Minister\'s ear, and now--. But he could not, and would not,\r\nbelieve it. "Nonsense, Palliser," he said. "You must have got some\r\nfalse notion into your head. There can be no possible reason why you\r\nshould not join us. Finespun himself will support us, at any rate\r\nfor a time." Mr. Finespun was the gentleman whose retirement from the\r\nministry the Duke of St. Bungay had now announced.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing of that kind," said Mr. Palliser, who perhaps felt\r\nhimself quite equal to the duties proposed to him, even though Mr.\r\nFinespun should not support him. "It is nothing of that kind;--it is\r\nno fear of that sort that hinders me."\r\n\r\n"Then, for mercy\'s sake, what is it? My dear Palliser, I looked upon\r\nyou as being as sure in this matter as myself; and I had a right\r\nto do so. You certainly intended to join us a month ago, if the\r\nopportunity offered. You certainly did."\r\n\r\n"It is true, Duke. I must ask you to listen to me now, and I must\r\ntell you what I would not willingly tell to any man." As Mr. Palliser\r\nsaid this a look of agony came over his face. There are men who can\r\ntalk easily of all their most inmost matters, but he was not such\r\na man. It went sorely against the grain with him to speak of the\r\nsorrow of his home, even to such a friend as the Duke; but it was\r\nessentially necessary to him that he should justify himself.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," said the Duke, "I can\'t understand that there should\r\nbe any reason strong enough to make you throw your party over."\r\n\r\n"I have promised to take my wife abroad."\r\n\r\n"Is that it?" said the Duke, looking at him with surprise, but at the\r\nsame time with something of returning joviality in his face. "Nobody\r\nthinks of going abroad at this time of the year. Of course, you can\r\nget away for a time when Parliament breaks up."\r\n\r\n"But I have promised to go at once."\r\n\r\n"Then, considering your position, you have made a promise which it\r\nbehoves you to break. I am sure Lady Glencora will see it in that\r\nlight."\r\n\r\n"You do not quite understand me, and I am afraid I must trouble you\r\nto listen to matters which, under other circumstances, it would\r\nbe impertinent in me to obtrude upon you." A certain stiffness of\r\ndemeanour, and measured propriety of voice, much at variance with his\r\nformer manner, came upon him as he said this.\r\n\r\n"Of course, Palliser, I don\'t want to interfere for a moment."\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me, Duke. My wife has told me that, this morning,\r\nwhich makes me feel that absence from England is requisite for her\r\npresent comfort. I was with her when you came, and had just promised\r\nher that she should go."\r\n\r\n"But, Palliser, think of it. If this were a small matter, I would\r\nnot press you; but a man in your position has public duties. He owes\r\nhis services to his country. He has no right to go back, if it be\r\npossible that he should so do."\r\n\r\n"When a man has given his word, it cannot be right that he should go\r\nback from that."\r\n\r\n"Of course not. But a man may be absolved from a promise. Lady\r\nGlencora--"\r\n\r\n"My wife would, of course, absolve me. It is not that. Her happiness\r\ndemands it, and it is partly my fault that it is so. I cannot explain\r\nto you more fully why it is that I must give up the great object for\r\nwhich I have striven with all my strength."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" said the Duke. "If you are sure that it is imperative--"\r\n\r\n"It is imperative."\r\n\r\n"I could give you twenty-four hours, you know." Mr. Palliser did\r\nnot answer at once, and the Duke thought that he saw some sign of\r\nhesitation. "I suppose it would not be possible that I should speak\r\nto Lady Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"It could be of no avail, Duke. She would only declare, at the first\r\nword, that she would remain in London; but it would not be the less\r\nmy duty on that account to take her abroad."\r\n\r\n"Well; I can\'t say. Of course, I can\'t say. Such an opportunity may\r\nnot come twice in a man\'s life. And at your age too! You are throwing\r\naway from you the finest political position that the world can offer\r\nto the ambition of any man. No one at your time of life has had such\r\na chance within my memory. That a man under thirty should be thought\r\nfit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and should refuse it,--because\r\nhe wants to take his wife abroad! Palliser, if she were dying, you\r\nshould remain under such an emergency as this. She might go, but you\r\nshould remain."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser remained silent for a moment or two in his chair; he then\r\nrose and walked towards the window, as he spoke. "There are things\r\nworse than death," he said, when his back was turned. His voice was\r\nvery low, and there was a tear in his eye as he spoke them; the words\r\nwere indeed whispered, but the Duke heard them, and felt that he\r\ncould not press him any more on the subject of his wife.\r\n\r\n"And must this be final?" said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I think it must. But your visit here has come so quickly on my\r\nresolution to go abroad,--which, in truth, was only made ten minutes\r\nbefore your name was brought to me,--that I believe I ought to ask\r\nfor a portion of those twenty-four hours which you have offered me. A\r\nsmall portion will be enough. Will you see me, if I come to you this\r\nevening, say at eight? If the House is up in the Lords I will go to\r\nyou in St. James\'s Square."\r\n\r\n"We shall be sitting after eight, I think."\r\n\r\n"Then I will see you there. And, Duke, I must ask you to think of me\r\nin this matter as a friend should think, and not as though we were\r\nbound together only by party feeling."\r\n\r\n"I will,--I will."\r\n\r\n"I have told you what I shall never whisper to any one else."\r\n\r\n"I think you know that you are safe with me."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it. And, Duke, I can tell you that the sacrifice to me\r\nwill be almost more than I can bear. This thing that you have offered\r\nme to-day is the only thing that I have ever coveted. I have thought\r\nof it and worked for it, have hoped and despaired, have for moments\r\nbeen vain enough to think that it was within my strength, and have\r\nbeen wretched for weeks together because I have told myself that it\r\nwas utterly beyond me."\r\n\r\n"As to that, neither Brock nor I, nor any of us, have any doubt.\r\nFinespun himself says that you are the man."\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to them. But I say all this simply that you may\r\nunderstand how imperative is the duty which, as I think, requires me\r\nto refuse the offer."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t refused as yet," said the Duke. "I shall wait at the\r\nHouse for you, whether they are sitting or not. And endeavour to join\r\nus. Do the best you can. I will say nothing as to that duty of which\r\nyou speak; but if it can be made compatible with your public service,\r\npray--pray let it be done. Remember how much such a one as you owes\r\nto his country." Then the Duke went, and Mr. Palliser was alone.\r\n\r\nHe had not been alone before since the revelation which had been made\r\nto him by his wife, and the words she had spoken were still sounding\r\nin his ears. "I do love Burgo Fitzgerald;--I do! I do! I do!" They\r\nwere not pleasant words for a young husband to hear. Men there are,\r\nno doubt, whose nature would make them more miserable under the\r\ninfliction than it had made Plantagenet Palliser. He was calm,\r\nwithout strong passion, not prone to give to words a stronger\r\nsignificance than they should bear;--and he was essentially\r\nunsuspicious. Never for a moment had he thought, even while those\r\nwords were hissing in his ears, that his wife had betrayed his\r\nhonour. Nevertheless, there was that at his heart, as he remembered\r\nthose words, which made him feel that the world was almost too heavy\r\nfor him. For the first quarter of an hour after the Duke\'s departure\r\nhe thought more of his wife and of Burgo Fitzgerald than he did of\r\nLord Brock and Mr. Finespun. But of this he was aware,--that he had\r\nforgiven his wife; that he had put his arm round her and embraced her\r\nafter hearing her confession,--and that she, mutely, with her eyes,\r\nhad promised him that she would do her best for him. Then something\r\nof an idea of love came across his heart, and he acknowledged to\r\nhimself that he had married without loving or without requiring love.\r\nMuch of all this had been his own fault. Indeed, had not the whole\r\nof it come from his own wrong-doing? He acknowledged that it was so.\r\nBut now,--now he loved her. He felt that he could not bear to part\r\nwith her, even if there were no question of public scandal, or of\r\ndisgrace. He had been torn inwardly by that assertion that she loved\r\nanother man. She had got at his heart-strings at last. There are men\r\nwho may love their wives, though they never can have been in love\r\nbefore their marriage.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke had been gone about an hour, and when, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, it would have been his time to go down to the House,\r\nhe took his hat and walked into the Park. He made his way across Hyde\r\nPark, and into Kensington Gardens, and there he remained for an hour,\r\nwalking up and down beneath the elms. The quidnuncs of the town, who\r\nchanced to see him, and who had heard something of the political\r\nmovements of the day, thought, no doubt, that he was meditating his\r\nfuture ministerial career. But he had not been there long before he\r\nhad resolved that no ministerial career was at present open to him.\r\n"It has been my own fault," he said, as he returned to his house,\r\n"and with God\'s help I will mend it, if it be possible."\r\n\r\nBut he was a slow man, and he did not go off instantly to the Duke.\r\nHe had given himself to eight o\'clock, and he took the full time.\r\nHe could not go down to the House of Commons because men would make\r\ninquiries of him which he would find it difficult to answer. So he\r\ndined at home, alone. He had told his wife that he would see her at\r\nnine, and before that hour he would not go to her. He sat alone till\r\nit was time for him to get into his brougham, and thought it all\r\nover. That seat in the Cabinet and Chancellorship of the Exchequer,\r\nwhich he had so infinitely desired, were already done with. There was\r\nno doubt about that. It might have been better for him not to have\r\nmarried; but now that he was married, and that things had brought\r\nhim untowardly to this pass, he knew that his wife\'s safety was his\r\nfirst duty. "We will go through Switzerland," he said to himself, "to\r\nBaden, and then we will get on to Florence and to Rome. She has seen\r\nnothing of all these things yet, and the new life will make a change\r\nin her. She shall have her own friend with her." Then he went down to\r\nthe House of Lords, and saw the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Well, Palliser," said the Duke, when he had listened to him, "of\r\ncourse I cannot argue it with you any more. I can only say that I am\r\nvery sorry;--more sorry than perhaps you will believe. Indeed, it\r\nhalf breaks my heart." The Duke\'s voice was very sad, and it might\r\nalmost have been thought that he was going to shed a tear. In truth\r\nhe disliked Mr. Finespun with the strongest political feeling of which\r\nhe was capable, and had attached himself to Mr. Palliser almost as\r\nstrongly. It was a thousand pities! How hard had he not worked to\r\nbring about this arrangement, which was now to be upset because a\r\nwoman had been foolish! "I never above half liked her," said the Duke\r\nto himself, thinking perhaps a little of the Duchess\'s complaints\r\nof her. "I must go to Brock at once," he said aloud, "and tell him.\r\nGod knows what we must do now. Goodbye! good-bye! No; I\'m not angry.\r\nThere shall be no quarrel. But I am very sorry." In this way the two\r\npoliticians parted.\r\n\r\nWe may as well follow this political movement to its end. The Duke\r\nsaw Lord Brock that night, and then those two ministers sent for\r\nanother minister,--another noble Lord, a man of great experience\r\nin Cabinets. These three discussed the matter together, and on the\r\nfollowing day Lord Brock got up in the House, and made a strong\r\nspeech in defence of his colleague, Mr. Finespun. To the end of the\r\nSession, at any rate, Mr. Finespun kept his position, and held the\r\nseals of the Exchequer while all the quidnuncs of the nation, shaking\r\ntheir heads, spoke of the wonderful power of Mr. Finespun, and\r\ndeclared that Lord Brock did not dare to face the Opposition without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Palliser had returned to his wife, and told her of\r\nhis resolution with reference to their tour abroad. "We may as well\r\nmake up our minds to start at once," said he. "At any rate, there is\r\nnothing on my side to hinder us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor\'s Name Gets into the Money Market.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome ten or twelve days after George Vavasor\'s return to London from\r\nWestmoreland he appeared at Mr. Scruby\'s offices with four small\r\nslips of paper in his hand. Mr. Scruby, as usual, was pressing for\r\nmoney. The third election was coming on, and money was already being\r\nspent very freely among the men of the River Bank. So, at least, Mr.\r\nScruby declared. Mr. Grimes, of the "Handsome Man," had shown signs\r\nof returning allegiance. But Mr. Grimes could not afford to be loyal\r\nwithout money. He had his little family to protect. Mr. Scruby,\r\ntoo, had his little family, and was not ashamed to use it on this\r\noccasion. "I\'m a family man, Mr. Vavasor, and therefore I never run\r\nany risks. I never go a yard further than I can see my way back."\r\nThis he had said in answer to a proposition that he should take\r\nGeorge\'s note of hand for the expenses of the next election, payable\r\nin three months\' time. "It is so very hard to realize," said George,\r\n"immediately upon a death, when all the property left is real\r\nproperty." "Very hard indeed," said Mr. Scruby, who had heard with\r\naccuracy all the particulars of the old Squire\'s will. Vavasor\r\nunderstood the lawyer, cursed him inwardly, and suggested to himself\r\nthat some day he might murder Mr. Scruby as well as John Grey,--and\r\nperhaps also a few more of his enemies. Two days after the interview\r\nin which his own note of hand had been refused, he again called in\r\nGreat Marlborough Street. Upon this occasion he tendered to Mr. Scruby\r\nfor his approval the four slips of paper which have been mentioned.\r\nMr. Scruby regarded them with attention, looking first at one side\r\nhorizontally, and then at the other side perpendicularly. But before\r\nwe learn the judgement pronounced by Mr. Scruby as to these four slips\r\nof paper, we must go back to their earlier history. As they were\r\nstill in their infancy, we shall not have to go back far.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at about eleven o\'clock the parlour-maid came up to\r\nAlice, as she sat alone in the drawing-room in Queen Anne Street, and\r\ntold her there was a "gentleman" in the hall waiting to be seen by\r\nher. We all know the tone in which servants announce a gentleman when\r\nthey know that the gentleman is not a gentleman.\r\n\r\n"A gentleman wanting to see me! What sort of a gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"Well, miss, I don\'t think he\'s just of our sort; but he\'s decent to\r\nlook at."\r\n\r\nAlice Vavasor had no desire to deny herself to any person but one.\r\nShe was well aware that the gentleman in the hall could not be her\r\ncousin George, and therefore she did not refuse to see him.\r\n\r\n"Let him come up," she said. "But I think, Jane, you ought to ask him\r\nhis name." Jane did ask him his name, and came back immediately,\r\nannouncing Mr. Levy.\r\n\r\nThis occurred immediately after the return of Mr. John Vavasor from\r\nWestmoreland. He had reached home late on the preceding evening, and\r\nat the moment of Mr. Levy\'s call was in his dressing-room.\r\n\r\nAlice got up to receive her visitor, and at once understood the tone\r\nof her maid\'s voice. Mr. Levy was certainly not a gentleman of the\r\nsort to which she had been most accustomed. He was a little dark man,\r\nwith sharp eyes, set very near to each other in his head, with a\r\nbeaked nose, thick at the bridge, and a black moustache, but no other\r\nbeard. Alice did not at all like the look of Mr. Levy, but she stood\r\nup to receive him, made him a little bow, and asked him to sit down.\r\n\r\n"Is papa dressed yet?" Alice asked the servant.\r\n\r\n"Well, miss, I don\'t think he is,--not to say dressed."\r\n\r\nAlice had thought it might be as well that Mr. Levy should know that\r\nthere was a gentleman in the house with her.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve called about a little bit of business, miss," said Mr. Levy,\r\nwhen they were alone. "Nothing as you need disturb yourself about.\r\nYou\'ll find it all square, I think." Then he took a case out of his\r\nbreast-pocket, and produced a note, which he handed to her. Alice\r\ntook the note, and saw immediately that it was addressed to her by\r\nher cousin George. "Yes, Mr. George Vavasor," said Mr. Levy. "I dare\r\nsay you never saw me before, miss?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I think not," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I am your cousin\'s clerk."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re Mr. Vavasor\'s clerk. I\'ll read his letter, if you please,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"If you please, miss."\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor\'s letter to his cousin was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR ALICE,\r\n\r\n   After what passed between us when I last saw you I thought\r\n   that on my return from Westmoreland I should learn that\r\n   you had paid in at my bankers\' the money that I require.\r\n   But I find that this is not so; and of course I excuse\r\n   you, because women so seldom know when or how to do that\r\n   which business demands of them. You have, no doubt, heard\r\n   the injustice which my grandfather has done me, and will\r\n   probably feel as indignant as I do. I only mention this\r\n   now, because the nature of his will makes it more than\r\n   ever incumbent on you that you should be true to your\r\n   pledge to me.\r\n\r\n   Till there shall be some ground for a better understanding\r\n   between us,--and this I do not doubt will come,--I think\r\n   it wiser not to call, myself, at Queen Anne Street. I\r\n   therefore send my confidential clerk with four bills, each\r\n   of five hundred pounds, drawn at fourteen days\' date,\r\n   across which I will get you to write your name. Mr. Levy\r\n   will show you the way in which this should be done. Your\r\n   name must come under the word "accepted," and just above\r\n   the name of Messrs. Drummonds, where the money must be\r\n   lying ready, at any rate, not later than Monday fortnight.\r\n   Indeed, the money must be there some time on the Saturday.\r\n   They know you so well at Drummonds\' that you will not\r\n   object to call on the Saturday afternoon, and ask if it is\r\n   all right.\r\n\r\n   I have certainly been inconvenienced by not finding the\r\n   money as I expected on my return to town. If these bills\r\n   are not properly provided for, the result will be very\r\n   disastrous to me. I feel, however, sure that this will be\r\n   done, both for your own sake and for mine.\r\n\r\n   Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n   GEORGE VAVASOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unparalleled impudence of this letter had the effect which the\r\nwriter had intended. It made Alice think immediately of her own\r\nremissness,--if she had been remiss,--rather than of the enormity of\r\nhis claim upon her. The decision with which he asked for her money,\r\nwithout any pretence at an excuse on his part, did for the time\r\ninduce her to believe that she had no alternative but to give it to\r\nhim, and that she had been wrong in delaying it. She had told him\r\nthat he should have it, and she ought to have been as good as her\r\nword. She should not have forced upon him the necessity of demanding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of signing four bills was terrible to her, and she felt\r\nsure that she ought not to put her name to orders for so large an\r\namount and then intrust them to such a man as Mr. Levy. Her father\r\nwas in the house, and she might have asked him. The thought that\r\nshe would do so of course occurred to her. But then it occurred to\r\nher also that were she to speak to her father as to this advancing\r\nof money to her cousin,--to this giving of money, for she now well\r\nunderstood that it would be a gift;--were she to consult her father\r\nin any way about it, he would hinder her, not only from signing the\r\nbills for Mr. Levy, but, as far as he could do so, from keeping the\r\npromise made to her cousin. She was resolved that George should have\r\nthe money, and she knew that she could give it to him in spite of her\r\nfather. But her father might probably be able to delay the gift, and\r\nthus rob it of its chief value. If she were to sign the bills, the\r\nmoney must be made to be forthcoming. So much she understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Levy had taken out the four bills from the same case, and had\r\nplaced them on the table before him. "Mr. Vavasor has explained, I\r\nbelieve, miss, what it is you have to do?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; my cousin has explained."\r\n\r\n"And there is nothing else to trouble you with, I believe. If you\r\nwill just write your name across them, here, I need not detain you by\r\nstaying any longer." Mr. Levy was very anxious to make his visit as\r\nshort as possible, since he had heard that Mr. John Vavasor was in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBut Alice hesitated. Two thousand pounds is a very serious sum of\r\nmoney. She had heard much of sharpers, and thought that she ought to\r\nbe cautious. What if this man, of whom she had never before heard,\r\nshould steal the bills after she had signed them? She looked again at\r\nher cousin\'s letter, chiefly with the object of gaining time.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, miss," said Mr. Levy.\r\n\r\n"Could you not leave them with me, sir?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Well; not very well, miss. No doubt Mr. Vavasor has explained it all;\r\nbut the fact is, he must have them this afternoon. He has got a heavy\r\nsum to put down on the nail about this here election, and if it ain\'t\r\ndown to-day, them on whom he has to depend will be all abroad."\r\n\r\n"But, sir, the money will not be payable to-day. If I understand it,\r\nthey are not cheques."\r\n\r\n"No, miss, no; they are not cheques. But your name, miss, at fourteen\r\ndays, is the same as ready money;--just the same."\r\n\r\nShe paused, and while she paused, he reached a pen for her from the\r\nwriting-table, and then she signed the four bills as he held them\r\nbefore her. She was quick enough at doing this when she had once\r\ncommenced the work. Her object, then, was that the man should be gone\r\nfrom the house before her father could meet him.\r\n\r\nThese were the four bits of paper which George Vavasor tendered to Mr.\r\nScruby\'s notice on the occasion which we have now in hand. In doing\r\nso, he made use of them after the manner of a grand capitalist, who\r\nknows that he may assume certain airs as he allows the odours of the\r\nsweetness of his wealth to drop from him.\r\n\r\n"You insisted on ready money, with your d---- suspicions," said he;\r\n"and there it is. You\'re not afraid of fourteen days, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"Fourteen days is neither here nor there," said Mr. Scruby. "We can\r\nlet our payments stand over as long as that, without doing any harm.\r\nI\'ll send one of my men down to Grimes, and tell him I can\'t see him,\r\ntill,--let me see," and he looked at one of the bills, "till the\r\n15th."\r\n\r\nBut this was not exactly what George Vavasor wanted. He was desirous\r\nthat the bills should be immediately turned into money, so that the\r\nnecessity of forcing payments from Alice, should due provision for\r\nthe bills not be made, might fall into other hands than his.\r\n\r\n"We can wait till the 15th," said Scruby, as he handed the bits of\r\npaper back to his customer.\r\n\r\n"You will want a thousand, you say?" said George.\r\n\r\n"A thousand to begin with. Certainly not less."\r\n\r\n"Then you had better keep two of them."\r\n\r\n"Well--no! I don\'t see the use of that. You had better collect them\r\nthrough your own banker, and let me have a cheque on the 15th or\r\n16th."\r\n\r\n"How cursed suspicious you are, Scruby."\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t. I\'m not a bit suspicious. I don\'t deal in such\r\narticles; that\'s all!"\r\n\r\n"What doubt can there be about such bills as those? Everybody knows\r\nthat my cousin has a considerable fortune, altogether at her own\r\ndisposal."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Mr. Vavasor, that bills with ladies\' names on\r\nthem,--ladies who are no way connected with business,--ain\'t just the\r\npaper that people like."\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth can be surer."\r\n\r\n"You take them into the City for discount, and see if the bankers\r\ndon\'t tell you the same. They may be done, of course, upon your name.\r\nI say nothing about that."\r\n\r\n"I can explain to you the nature of the family arrangement, but I\r\ncan\'t do that to a stranger. However, I don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"Of course not. The time is so short that it does not signify. Have\r\nthem collected through your own bankers, and then, if it don\'t suit\r\nyou to call, send me a cheque for a thousand pounds when the time\r\nis up." Then Mr. Scruby turned to some papers on his right hand, as\r\nthough the interview had been long enough. Vavasor looked at him\r\nangrily, opening his wound at him and cursing him inwardly. Mr. Scruby\r\nwent on with his paper, by no means regarding either the wound or the\r\nunspoken curses. Thereupon Vavasor got up and went away without any\r\nword of farewell.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along Great Marlborough Street, and through those\r\nunalluring streets which surround the Soho district, and so on to\r\nthe Strand and his own lodgings, he still continued to think of some\r\nwide scheme of revenge,--of some scheme in which Mr. Scruby might be\r\nincluded. There had appeared something latterly in Mr. Scruby\'s manner\r\nto him, something of mingled impatience and familiarity, which made\r\nhim feel that he had fallen in the attorney\'s estimation. It was not\r\nthat the lawyer thought him to be less honourable, or less clever,\r\nthan he had before thought him; but that the man was like a rat,\r\nand knew a falling house by the instinct that was in him. So George\r\nVavasor cursed Mr. Scruby, and calculated some method of murdering him\r\nwithout detection.\r\n\r\nThe reader is not to suppose that the Member for the Chelsea\r\nDistricts had, in truth, resolved to gratify his revenge by\r\nmurder,--by murdering any of those persons whom he hated so\r\nvigorously. He did not, himself, think it probable that he would\r\nbecome a murderer. But he received some secret satisfaction in\r\nallowing his mind to dwell upon the subject, and in making those\r\ncalculations. He reflected that it would not do to take off Scruby\r\nand John Grey at the same time, as it would be known that he was\r\nconnected with both of them; unless, indeed, he was to take off a\r\nthird person at the same time,--a third person, as to the expediency\r\nof ending whose career he made his calculations quite as often as he\r\ndid in regard to any of those persons whom he cursed so often. It\r\nneed hardly be explained to the reader that this third person was the\r\nsitting Member for the Chelsea Districts.\r\n\r\nAs he was himself in want of instant ready money Mr. Scruby\'s\r\nproposition that he should leave the four bills at his own bankers\',\r\nto be collected when they came to maturity, did not suit him. He\r\ndoubted much, also, whether at the end of the fourteen days the\r\nmoney would be forthcoming. Alice would be driven to tell her father,\r\nin order that the money might be procured, and John Vavasor would\r\nprobably succeed in putting impediments in the way of the payment.\r\nHe must take the bills into the City, and do the best there that he\r\ncould with them. He was too late for this to-day, and therefore he\r\nwent to his lodgings, and then down to the House. In the House he\r\nsat all the night with his hat over his eyes, making those little\r\ncalculations of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\n"You have heard the news; haven\'t you?" said Mr. Bott to him,\r\nwhispering in his ear.\r\n\r\n"News; no. I haven\'t heard any news."\r\n\r\n"Finespun has resigned, and Palliser is at this moment with the Duke\r\nof St. Bungay in the Lords\' library."\r\n\r\n"They may both be at the bottom of the Lords\' fishpond, for what I\r\ncare," said Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, you know," said Bott. "Still, you know Palliser is\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer at this moment. What a lucky fellow you\r\nare to have such a chance come to you directly you get in. As soon as\r\nhe takes his seat down there, of course we shall go up behind him."\r\n\r\n"We shall have another election in a month\'s time," said George. "I\'m\r\nsafe enough," said Bott. "It never hurts a man at elections to be\r\nclosely connected with the Government."\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor was in the City by times the next morning, but he\r\nfound that the City did not look with favourable eyes on his four\r\nbills. The City took them up, first horizontally, and then, with\r\na twist of its hand, perpendicularly, and looked at them with\r\ndistrustful eyes. The City repeated the name, Alice Vavasor, as\r\nthough it were not esteemed a good name on Change. The City suggested\r\nthat as the time was so short, the holder of the bills would be wise\r\nto hold them till he could collect the amount. It was very clear that\r\nthe City suspected something wrong in the transaction. The City, by\r\none of its mouths, asserted plainly that ladies\' bills never meant\r\nbusiness. George Vavasor cursed the City, and made his calculation\r\nabout murdering it. Might not a river of strychnine be turned on\r\nround the Exchange about luncheon time? Three of the bills he left\r\nat last with his own bankers for collection, and retained the fourth\r\nin his breast-pocket, intending on the morrow to descend with it\r\ninto those lower depths of the money market which he had not as yet\r\nvisited. Again, on the next day, he went to work and succeeded to\r\nsome extent. Among those lower depths he found a capitalist who was\r\nwilling to advance him two hundred pounds, keeping that fourth bill\r\nin his possession as security. The capitalist was to have forty\r\npounds for the transaction, and George cursed him as he took his\r\ncheque. George Vavasor knew quite enough of the commercial world to\r\nenable him to understand that a man must be in a very bad condition\r\nwhen he consents to pay forty pounds for the use of two hundred for\r\nfourteen days. He cursed the City. He cursed the House of Commons. He\r\ncursed his cousin Alice and his sister Kate. He cursed the memory of\r\nhis grandfather. And he cursed himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Levy had hardly left the house in Queen Anne Street, before\r\nAlice had told her father what she had done. "The money must be\r\nforthcoming," said Alice. To this her father made no immediate reply,\r\nbut turning himself in his chair away from her with a sudden start,\r\nsat looking at the fire and shaking his head. "The money must be made\r\nto be forthcoming," said Alice. "Papa, will you see that it is done?"\r\nThis was very hard upon poor John Vavasor, and so he felt it to\r\nbe. "Papa, if you will not promise, I must go to Mr. Round about it\r\nmyself, and must find out a broker to sell out for me. You would not\r\nwish that my name should be dishonoured."\r\n\r\n"You will be ruined," said he, "and for such a rascal as that!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind whether he is a rascal or not, papa. You must acknowledge\r\nthat he has been treated harshly by his grandfather."\r\n\r\n"I think that will was the wisest thing my father ever did. Had he\r\nleft the estate to George, there wouldn\'t have been an acre of it\r\nleft in the family in six months\' time."\r\n\r\n"But the life interest, papa!"\r\n\r\n"He would have raised all he could upon that, and it would have done\r\nhim no good."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, papa, he must have this two thousand pounds. You must\r\npromise me that."\r\n\r\n"And then he will want more."\r\n\r\n"No; I do not think he will ask for more. At any rate, I do not think\r\nthat I am bound to give him all that I have."\r\n\r\n"I should think not. I should like to know how you can be bound to\r\ngive him anything?"\r\n\r\n"Because I promised it. I have signed the bills now, and it must be\r\ndone." Still Mr. Vavasor made no promise. "Papa, if you will not say\r\nthat you will do it, I must go down to Mr. Round at once."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I can do it. I don\'t know that Mr. Round can do\r\nit. Your money is chiefly on mortgage." Then there was a pause for\r\na moment in the conversation. "Upon my word, I never heard of such\r\na thing in my life," said Mr. Vavasor; "I never did. Four thousand\r\npounds given away to such a man as that, in three months! Four\r\nthousand pounds! And you say you do not intend to marry him."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; all that is over."\r\n\r\n"And does he know that it is over?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he does."\r\n\r\n"You suppose so! Things of that sort are so often over with you!"\r\nThis was very cruel. Perhaps she had deserved the reproach, but still\r\nit was very cruel. The blow struck her with such force that she\r\nstaggered under it. Tears came into her eyes, and she could hardly\r\nspeak lest she should betray herself by sobbing.\r\n\r\n"I know that I have behaved badly," she said at last; "but I am\r\npunished, and you might spare me now!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t want to punish you," he said, getting up from his chair and\r\nwalking about the room. "I don\'t want to punish you. But, I don\'t\r\nwant to see you ruined!"\r\n\r\n"I must go to Mr. Round then, myself."\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor went on walking about the room, jingling the money in\r\nhis trousers-pockets, and pushing the chairs about as he chanced to\r\nmeet them. At last, he made a compromise with her. He would take a\r\nday to think whether he would assist her in getting the money, and\r\ncommunicate his decision to her on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nThe Bills Are Made All Right.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor was at his wits\' end about his daughter. She had put her\r\nname to four bills for five hundred pounds each, and had demanded\r\nfrom him, almost without an apology, his aid in obtaining money to\r\nmeet them. And she might put her name to any other number of bills,\r\nand for any amount! There was no knowing how a man ought to behave\r\nto such a daughter. "I don\'t want her money," the father said to\r\nhimself; "and if she had got none of her own, I would make her as\r\ncomfortable as I could with my own income. But to see her throw her\r\nmoney away in such a fashion as this is enough to break a man\'s\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor went to his office in Chancery Lane, but he did not go to\r\nthe chambers of Mr. Round, the lawyer. Instead of calling on Mr. Round\r\nhe sent a note by a messenger to Suffolk Street, and the answer to\r\nthe note came in the person of Mr. Grey. John Grey was living in town\r\nin these days, and was in the habit of seeing Mr. Vavasor frequently.\r\nIndeed, he had not left London since the memorable occasion on which\r\nhe had pitched his rival down the tailor\'s stairs at his lodgings. He\r\nhad made himself pretty well conversant with George Vavasor\'s career,\r\nand had often shuddered as he thought what might be the fate of any\r\ngirl who might trust herself to marry such a man as that.\r\n\r\nHe had been at home when Mr. Vavasor\'s note had reached his lodgings,\r\nand had instantly walked off towards Chancery Lane. He knew his way\r\nto Mr. Vavasor\'s signing-office very accurately, for he had acquired\r\na habit of calling there, and of talking to the father about his\r\ndaughter. He was a patient, persevering man, confident in himself,\r\nand apt to trust that he would accomplish those things which he\r\nattempted, though he was hardly himself aware of any such aptitude.\r\nHe had never despaired as to Alice. And though he had openly\r\nacknowledged to himself that she had been very foolish,--or rather,\r\nthat her judgement had failed her,--he had never in truth been\r\nangry with her. He had looked upon her rejection of himself, and\r\nher subsequent promise to her cousin, as the effects of a mental\r\nhallucination, very much to be lamented,--to be wept for, perhaps,\r\nthrough a whole life, as a source of terrible sorrow to himself\r\nand to her. But he regarded it all as a disease, of which the cure\r\nwas yet possible,--as a disease which, though it might never leave\r\nthe patient as strong as she was before, might still leave her\r\naltogether. And as he would still have clung to his love had she been\r\nattacked by any of those illnesses for which doctors have well-known\r\nnames, so would he cling to her now that she was attacked by a malady\r\nfor which no name was known. He had already heard from Mr. Vavasor\r\nthat Alice had discovered how impossible it was that she should marry\r\nher cousin, and, in his quiet, patient, enduring way, was beginning\r\nto feel confident that he would, at last, carry his mistress off with\r\nhim to Nethercoats.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a melancholy place, that signing-office, in which\r\nMr. John Vavasor was doomed to spend twelve hours a week, during every\r\nterm time, of his existence. Whether any man could really pass an\r\nexistence of work in such a workshop, and not have gone mad,--could\r\nhave endured to work there for seven hours a day, every week-day of\r\nhis life, I am not prepared to say. I doubt much whether any victims\r\nare so doomed. I have so often wandered through those gloomy passages\r\nwithout finding a sign of humanity there,--without hearing any\r\nslightest tick of the hammer of labour, that I am disposed to think\r\nthat Lord Chancellors have been anxious to save their subordinates\r\nfrom suicide, and have mercifully decreed that the whole staff of\r\nlabourers, down to the very message boys of the office, should be\r\nsent away to green fields or palatial clubs during, at any rate, a\r\nmoiety of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe dismal set of chambers, in which the most dismal room had been\r\nassigned to Mr. Vavasor, was not actually in Chancery Lane. Opening\r\noff from Chancery Lane are various other small lanes, quiet, dingy\r\nnooks, some of them in the guise of streets going no whither,\r\nsome being thoroughfares to other dingy streets beyond, in which\r\nsponging-houses abound, and others existing as the entrances to\r\nso-called Inns of Court,--inns of which all knowledge has for years\r\nbeen lost to the outer world of the laity, and, as I believe, lost\r\nalmost equally to the inner world of the legal profession. Who has\r\never heard of Symonds\' Inn? But an ancestral Symonds, celebrated, no\r\ndoubt, in his time, did found an inn, and there it is to this day. Of\r\nStaples\' Inn, who knows the purposes or use? Who are its members, and\r\nwhat do they do as such? And Staples\' Inn is an inn with pretensions,\r\nhaving a chapel of its own, or, at any rate, a building which, in\r\nits external dimensions, is ecclesiastical, having a garden and\r\narchitectural proportions; and a facade towards Holborn, somewhat\r\ndingy, but respectable, with an old gateway, and with a decided\r\ncharacter of its own.\r\n\r\nThe building in which Mr. John Vavasor had a room and a desk was\r\nlocated in one of these side streets, and had, in its infantine days,\r\nbeen regarded with complacency by its founder. It was stone-faced,\r\nand strong, and though very ugly, had about it that air of importance\r\nwhich justifies a building in assuming a special name of itself. This\r\nbuilding was called the Accountant-General\'s Record Office, and very\r\nprobably, in the gloom of its dark cellars, may lie to this day the\r\nrecords of the expenditure of many a fair property which has gotten\r\nitself into Chancery, and has never gotten itself out again. It was\r\nentered by a dark hall, the door of which was never closed; and\r\nwhich, having another door at its further end leading into another\r\nlane, had become itself a thoroughfare. But the passers through it\r\nwere few in number. Now and then a boy might be seen there carrying\r\non his head or shoulders a huge mass of papers which you would\r\npresume to be accounts, or some clerk employed in the purlieus of\r\nChancery Lane who would know the shortest possible way from the\r\nchambers of some one attorney to those of some other. But this hall,\r\nthough open at both ends, was as dark as Erebus; and any who lingered\r\nin it would soon find themselves to be growing damp, and would smell\r\nmildew, and would become naturally affected by the exhalations\r\narising from those Chancery records beneath their feet.\r\n\r\nUp the stone stairs, from this hall, John Grey passed to Mr. Vavasor\'s\r\nsigning-room. The stairs were broad, and almost of noble proportions,\r\nbut the darkness and gloom which hung about the hall, hung also about\r\nthem,--a melancholy set of stairs, up and down which no man can walk\r\nwith cheerful feet. Here he came upon a long, broad passage, in which\r\nno sound was, at first, to be heard. There was no busy noise of doors\r\nslamming, no rapid sound of shoes, no passing to and fro of men\r\nintent on their daily bread. Pausing for a moment, that he might\r\nlook round about him and realize the deathlike stillness of the\r\nwhole, John Grey could just distinguish the heavy breathing of a man,\r\nthereby learning that there was a captive in, at any rate, one of\r\nthose prisons on each side of him. As he drew near to the door of Mr.\r\nVavasor\'s chamber he knew that the breathing came from thence.\r\n\r\nOn the door there were words inscribed, which were just legible in\r\nthe gloom--"Signing Room. Mr. Vavasor."\r\n\r\nHow John Vavasor did hate those words! It seemed to him that they\r\nhad been placed there with the express object of declaring his\r\ndegradation aloud to the world. Since his grandfather\'s will had\r\nbeen read to him he had almost made up his mind to go down those\r\nmelancholy stairs for the last time, to shake the dust off his feet\r\nas he left the Accountant-General\'s Record Office for ever, and\r\ncontent himself with half his official income. But how could he give\r\nup so many hundreds a year while his daughter was persisting in\r\nthrowing away thousands as fast as, or faster than, she could lay her\r\nhands on them?\r\n\r\nJohn Grey entered the room and found Mr. Vavasor sitting all alone in\r\nan arm-chair over the fire. I rather think that that breathing had\r\nbeen the breathing of a man asleep. He was resting himself amidst the\r\nlabours of his signing. It was a large, dull room, which could not\r\nhave been painted, I should think, within the memory of man, looking\r\nout backwards into some court. The black wall of another building\r\nseemed to stand up close to the window,--so close that no direct ray\r\nof the sun ever interrupted the signing-clerk at his work. In the\r\nmiddle of the room there was a large mahogany-table, on which lay a\r\npile of huge papers. Across the top of them there was placed a bit\r\nof blotting-paper, with a quill pen, the two only tools which were\r\nnecessary to the performance of the signing-clerk\'s work. On the\r\ntable there stood a row of official books, placed lengthways on\r\ntheir edges: the "Post-Office Directory," the "Court Circular,"\r\na "Directory to the Inns of Court," a dusty volume of Acts of\r\nParliament, which had reference to Chancery accounts,--a volume which\r\nMr. Vavasor never opened; and there were some others; but there was\r\nno book there in which any Christian man or woman could take delight,\r\neither for amusement or for recreation. There were three or four\r\nchairs round the wall, and there was the one arm-chair which the\r\noccupant of the chamber had dragged away from its sacred place to the\r\nhearth-rug. There was also an old Turkey carpet on the floor. Other\r\nfurniture there was none. Can it be a matter of surprise to any one\r\nthat Mr. Vavasor preferred his club to his place of business? He was\r\nnot left quite alone in this deathlike dungeon. Attached to his own\r\nlarge room there was a small closet, in which sat the signing-clerk\'s\r\nclerk,--a lad of perhaps seventeen years of age, who spent the\r\ngreatest part of his time playing tit-tat-to by himself upon official\r\nblotting-paper. Had I been Mr. Vavasor I should have sworn a bosom\r\nfriendship with that lad, have told him all my secrets, and joined\r\nhis youthful games.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" Mr. Vavasor had cried when John Grey disturbed his slumber\r\nby knocking at the door. "I\'m glad to see you,--very. Sit down; won\'t\r\nyou? Did you ever see such a wretched fire? The coals they give you\r\nin this place are the worst in all London. Did you ever see such\r\ncoals?" And he gave a wicked poke at the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 1st of May, and Grey, who had walked from Suffolk\r\nStreet, was quite warm. "One hardly wants a fire at all, such weather\r\nas this," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh; don\'t you?" said the signing-clerk. "If you had to sit here all\r\nday, you\'d see if you didn\'t want a fire. It\'s the coldest building I\r\never put my foot in. Sometimes in winter I have to sit here the whole\r\nday in a great-coat. I only wish I could shut old Sugden up here for\r\na week or two, after Christmas." The great lawyer whom he had named\r\nwas the man whom he supposed to have inflicted on him the terrible\r\ninjury of his life, and he was continually invoking small misfortunes\r\non the head of that tyrant.\r\n\r\n"How is Alice?" said Grey, desiring to turn the subject from the\r\nten-times-told tale of his friend\'s wrongs.\r\n\r\nMr. Vavasor sighed. "She is well enough, I believe," he said.\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter in Queen Anne Street?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll hardly believe it when I tell you; and, indeed, I hardly know\r\nwhether I ought to tell you or not."\r\n\r\n"As you and I have gone so far together, I think that you ought to\r\ntell me anything that concerns her nearly."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. It\'s about her money. Do you know, Grey, I\'m\r\nbeginning to think that I\'ve been wrong in allowing you to advance\r\nwhat you have done on her account?"\r\n\r\n"Why wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Because I foresee there\'ll be a difficulty about it. How are we to\r\nmanage about the repayment?"\r\n\r\n"If she becomes my wife there will be no management wanted."\r\n\r\n"But how if she never becomes your wife? I\'m beginning to think\r\nshe\'ll never do anything like any other woman."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite sure that you understand her," said Grey; "though of\r\ncourse you ought to do so better than any one else."\r\n\r\n"Nobody can understand her," said the angry father. "She told me the\r\nother day, as you know, that she was going to have nothing more to do\r\nwith her cousin--"\r\n\r\n"Has she--has she become friends with him again?" said Grey. As he\r\nasked the question there came a red spot on each cheek, showing the\r\nstrong mental anxiety which had prompted it.\r\n\r\n"No; I believe not;--that is, certainly not in the way you mean. I\r\nthink that she is beginning to know that he is a rascal."\r\n\r\n"It is a great blessing that she has learned the truth before it was\r\ntoo late."\r\n\r\n"But would you believe it;--she has given him her name to bills for\r\ntwo thousand pounds, payable at two weeks\' sight? He sent to her only\r\nthis morning a fellow that he called his clerk, and she has been fool\r\nenough to accept them. Two thousand pounds! That comes of leaving\r\nmoney at a young woman\'s own disposal."\r\n\r\n"But we expected that, you know," said Grey, who seemed to take the\r\nnews with much composure.\r\n\r\n"Expected it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course we did. You yourself did not suppose that what he had\r\nbefore would have been the last."\r\n\r\n"But after she had quarrelled with him!"\r\n\r\n"That would make no difference with her. She had promised him her\r\nmoney, and as it seems that he will be content with that, let her\r\nkeep her promise."\r\n\r\n"And give him everything! Not if I can help it. I\'ll expose him. I\r\nwill indeed. Such a pitiful rascal as he is!"\r\n\r\n"You will do nothing, Mr. Vavasor, that will injure your daughter. I\'m\r\nvery sure of that."\r\n\r\n"But, by heavens--. Such sheer robbery as that! Two thousand pounds\r\nmore in fourteen days!" The shortness of the date at which the bills\r\nwere drawn seemed to afflict Mr. Vavasor almost as keenly as the\r\namount. Then he described the whole transaction as accurately as he\r\ncould do so, and also told how Alice had declared her purpose of\r\ngoing to Mr. Round the lawyer, if her father would not undertake to\r\nprocure the money for her by the time the bills should become due.\r\n"Mr. Round, you know, has heard nothing about it," he continued. "He\r\ndoesn\'t dream of any such thing. If she would take my advice, she\r\nwould leave the bills, and let them be dishonoured. As it is, I think\r\nI shall call at Drummonds\', and explain the whole transaction."\r\n\r\n"You must not do that," said Grey. "I will call at Drummonds\',\r\ninstead, and see that the money is all right for the bills. As far as\r\nthey go, let him have his plunder."\r\n\r\n"And if she won\'t take you, at last, Grey? Upon my word, I don\'t\r\nthink she ever will. My belief is she\'ll never get married. She\'ll\r\nnever do anything like any other woman."\r\n\r\n"The money won\'t be missed by me if I never get married," said Grey,\r\nwith a smile. "If she does marry me, of course I shall make her pay\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"No, by George! that won\'t do," said Vavasor. "If she were your\r\ndaughter you\'d know that she could not take a man\'s money in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"And I know it now, though she is not my daughter. I was only joking.\r\nAs soon as I am certain,--finally certain,--that she can never become\r\nmy wife, I will take back my money. You need not be afraid. The\r\nnature of the arrangement we have made shall then be explained to\r\nher."\r\n\r\nIn this way it was settled; and on the following morning the father\r\ninformed the daughter that he had done her bidding, and that the\r\nmoney would be placed to her credit at the bankers\' before the bills\r\ncame due. On that Saturday, the day which her cousin had named in his\r\nletter, she trudged down to Drummonds\', and was informed by a very\r\ncourteous senior clerk in that establishment, that due preparation\r\nfor the bills had been made.\r\n\r\nSo far, I think we may say that Mr. George Vavasor was not\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nGoing Abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, early in May, a full week before Alice\'s visit to the\r\nbankers\' at Charing Cross, a servant in grand livery, six feet high,\r\ngot out of a cab at the door in Queen Anne Street, and sent up a\r\nnote for Miss Vavasor, declaring that he would wait in the cab for\r\nher answer. He had come from Lady Glencora, and had been specially\r\nordered to go in a cab and come back in a cab, and make himself as\r\nlike a Mercury, with wings to his feet, as may be possible to a\r\nLondon footman. Mr. Palliser had arranged his plans with his wife that\r\nmorning,--or, I should more correctly say, had given her his orders,\r\nand she, in consequence, had sent away her Mercury in hot pressing\r\nhaste to Queen Anne Street. "Do come;--instantly if you can," the\r\nnote said. "I have so much to tell you, and so much to ask of you. If\r\nyou can\'t come, when shall I find you, and where?" Alice sent back a\r\nnote, saying that she would be in Park Lane as soon as she could put\r\non her bonnet and walk down; and then the Mercury went home in his\r\ncab.\r\n\r\nAlice found her friend in the small breakfast-room up-stairs, sitting\r\nclose by the window. They had not as yet met since the evening of\r\nLady Monk\'s party, nor had Lady Glencora seen Alice in the mourning\r\nwhich she now wore for her grandfather. "Oh, dear, what a change it\r\nmakes in you," she said. "I never thought of your being in black."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it is you want, but shan\'t I do in mourning as\r\nwell as I would in colours?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do in anything, dear. But I have so much to tell you, and I\r\ndon\'t know how to begin. And I\'ve so much to ask of you, and I\'m so\r\nafraid you won\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"You generally find me very complaisant."\r\n\r\n"No I don\'t, dear. It is very seldom you will do anything for me.\r\nBut I must tell you everything first. Do take your bonnet off, for\r\nI shall be hours in doing it."\r\n\r\n"Hours in telling me!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and in getting your consent to what I want you to do. But I\r\nthink I\'ll tell you that first. I\'m to be taken abroad immediately."\r\n\r\n"Who is to take you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you may well ask that. If you could know what questions I have\r\nasked myself on that head! I sometimes say things to myself as though\r\nthey were the most proper and reasonable things in the world, and\r\nthen within an hour or two I hate myself for having thought of them."\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t you answer me? Who is going abroad with you?"\r\n\r\n"Well; you are to be one of the party."\r\n\r\n"I!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you. When I have named so very respectable a chaperon for my\r\nyouth, of course you will understand that my husband is to take us."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Palliser can\'t leave London at this time of the year?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. He is to leave London at this time of the year.\r\nDon\'t look in that way, for it\'s all settled. Whether you go with\r\nme or not, I\'ve got to go. To-day is Tuesday. We are to be off next\r\nTuesday night, if you can make yourself ready. We shall breakfast in\r\nParis on Wednesday morning, and then it will be to us all just as if\r\nwe were in a new world. Mr. Palliser will walk up and down the new\r\ncourt of the Louvre, and you will be on his left arm, and I shall be\r\non his right,--just like English people,--and it will be the most\r\nproper thing that ever was seen in life. Then we shall go on to\r\nBasle"--Alice shuddered as Basle was mentioned, thinking of the\r\nbalcony over the river--"and so to Lucerne--. But no; that was the\r\nfirst plan, and Mr. Palliser altered it. He spent a whole day up\r\nhere with maps and Bradshaw\'s and Murray\'s guide-books, and he\r\nscolded me so because I didn\'t care whether we went first to Baden\r\nor to some other place. How could I care? I told him I would go\r\nanywhere he chose to take me. Then he told me I was heartless;--and\r\nI acknowledged that I was heartless. \'I am heartless,\' I said. \'Tell\r\nme something I don\'t know.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cora, why did you say that?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t choose to contradict my husband. Besides, it\'s true. Then\r\nhe threw the Bradshaw away, and all the maps flew about. So I picked\r\nthem up again, and said we\'d go to Switzerland first. I knew that\r\nwould settle it, and of course he decided on stopping at Baden. If he\r\nhad said Jericho, it would have been the same thing to me. Wouldn\'t\r\nyou like to go to Jericho?"\r\n\r\n"I should have no special objection to Jericho."\r\n\r\n"But you are to go to Baden instead."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve said nothing about that yet. But you have not told me half your\r\nstory. Why is Mr. Palliser going abroad in the middle of Parliament in\r\nthis way?"\r\n\r\n"Ah; now I must go back to the beginning. And indeed, Alice, I hardly\r\nknow how to tell you; not that I mind you knowing it, only there are\r\nsome things that won\'t get themselves told. You can hardly guess what\r\nit is that he is giving up. You must swear that you won\'t repeat what\r\nI\'m going to tell you now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a person apt to tell secrets, but I shan\'t swear anything."\r\n\r\n"What a woman you are for discretion! it is you that ought to be\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer; you are so wise. Only you haven\'t\r\nbrought your own pigs to the best market, after all."\r\n\r\n"Never mind my own pigs now, Cora."\r\n\r\n"I do mind them, very much. But the secret is this. They have asked\r\nMr. Palliser to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he has--refused.\r\nThink of that!"\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"Because of me,--of me, and my folly, and wickedness, and\r\nabominations. Because he has been fool enough to plague himself with\r\na wife--he who of all men ought to have kept himself free from such\r\ntroubles. Oh, he has been so good! It is almost impossible to make\r\nany one understand it. If you could know how he has longed for this\r\noffice;--how he has worked for it day and night, wearing his eyes out\r\nwith figures when everybody else has been asleep, shutting himself up\r\nwith such creatures as Mr. Bott when other men have been shooting and\r\nhunting and flirting and spending their money. He has been a slave to\r\nit for years,--all his life I believe,--in order that he might sit\r\nin the Cabinet, and be a minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nHe has hoped and feared, and has been, I believe, sometimes half-mad\r\nwith expectation. This has been his excitement,--what racing and\r\ngambling are to other men. At last, the place was there, ready for\r\nhim, and they offered it to him. They begged him to take it, almost\r\non their knees. The Duke of St. Bungay was here all one morning about\r\nit; but Mr. Palliser sent him away, and refused the place. It\'s all\r\nover now, and the other man, whom they all hate so much, is to remain\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"But why did he refuse it?"\r\n\r\n"I keep on telling you--because of me. He found that I wanted looking\r\nafter, and that Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott between them couldn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cora! how can you talk in that way?"\r\n\r\n"If you knew all, you might well ask how I could. You remember about\r\nLady Monk\'s ball, that you would not go to,--as you ought to have\r\ndone. If you had gone, Mr. Palliser would have been Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer at this minute; he would, indeed. Only think of that! But\r\nthough you did not go, other people did who ought to have remained at\r\nhome. I went for one,--and you know who was there for another."\r\n\r\n"What difference could that make to you?" said Alice, angrily.\r\n\r\n"It might have made a great deal of difference. And, for the matter\r\nof that, so it did. Mr. Palliser was there too, but, of course, he\r\nwent away immediately. I can\'t tell you all the trouble there had\r\nbeen about Mrs. Marsham,--whether I was to take her with me or not.\r\nHowever, I wouldn\'t take her, and didn\'t take her. The carriage went\r\nfor her first, and there she was when we got there; and Mr. Bott was\r\nthere too. I wonder whether I shall ever make you understand it all."\r\n\r\n"There are some things I don\'t want to understand."\r\n\r\n"There they both were watching me,--looking at me the whole evening;\r\nand, of course, I resolved that I would not be put down by them."\r\n\r\n"I think, if I had been you, I would not have allowed their presence\r\nto make any difference to me."\r\n\r\n"That is very easily said, my dear, but by no means so easily done.\r\nYou can\'t make yourself unconscious of eyes that are always looking\r\nat you. I dared them, at any rate, to do their worst, for I stood up\r\nto dance with Burgo Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cora!"\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I? At any rate I did; and I waltzed with him for half\r\nan hour. Alice, I never will waltz again;--never. I have done with\r\ndancing now. I don\'t think, even in my maddest days, I ever kept it\r\nup so long as I did then. And I knew that everybody was looking at\r\nme. It was not only Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott, but everybody there.\r\nI felt myself to be desperate,--mad, like a wild woman. There I was,\r\ngoing round and round and round with the only man for whom I ever\r\ncared two straws. It seemed as though everything had been a dream\r\nsince the old days. Ah! how well I remember the first time I danced\r\nwith him,--at his aunt\'s house in Cavendish Square. They had only\r\njust brought me out in London then, and I thought that he was a god."\r\n\r\n"Cora! I cannot bear to hear you talk like that."\r\n\r\n"I know well enough that he is no god now; some people say that he is\r\na devil, but he was like Apollo to me then. Did you ever see anyone\r\nso beautiful as he is?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw him at all."\r\n\r\n"I wish you could have seen him; but you will some day. I don\'t know\r\nwhether you care for men being handsome." Alice thought of John Grey,\r\nwho was the handsomest man that she knew, but she made no answer.\r\n"I do; or, rather, I used to do," continued Lady Glencora. "I don\'t\r\nthink I care much about anything now; but I don\'t see why handsome\r\nmen should not be run after as much as handsome women."\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t have a girl run after any man, would you; whether\r\nhandsome or ugly?"\r\n\r\n"But they do, you know. When I saw him the other night he was just as\r\nhandsome as ever;--the same look, half wild and half tame, like an\r\nanimal you cannot catch, but which you think would love you so if you\r\ncould catch him. In a little while it was just like the old time, and\r\nI had made up my mind to care nothing for the people looking at me."\r\n\r\n"And you think that was right?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. Yes, I do; that is. It wasn\'t right to care about\r\ndancing with him, but it was right to disregard all the people gaping\r\nround. What was it to them? Why should they care who I danced with?"\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, dear, and you must know that it is so. If you were\r\nto see a woman misbehaving herself in public, would not you look on\r\nand make your comments? Could you help doing so if you were to try?"\r\n\r\n"You are very severe, Alice. Misbehaving in public!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Cora. I am only taking your own story. According to that, you\r\nwere misbehaving in public."\r\n\r\nLady Glencora got up from her chair near the window, on which she had\r\nbeen crouching close to Alice\'s knees, and walked away towards the\r\nfireplace. "What am I to say to you, or how am I to talk to you?"\r\nsaid Alice. "You would not have me tell you a lie?"\r\n\r\n"Of all things in the world, I hate a prude the most," said Lady\r\nGlencora.\r\n\r\n"Cora, look here. If you consider it prudery on my part to disapprove\r\nof your waltzing with Mr. Fitzgerald in the manner you have\r\ndescribed,--or, indeed, in any other manner,--you and I must differ\r\nso totally about the meaning of words and the nature of things that\r\nwe had better part."\r\n\r\n"Alice, you are the unkindest creature that ever lived. You are as\r\ncold as stone. I sometimes think that you can have no heart."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind your saying that. Whether I have a heart or not I will\r\nleave you to find out for yourself; but I won\'t be called a prude by\r\nyou. You know you were wrong to dance with that man. What has come of\r\nit? What have you told me yourself this morning? In order to preserve\r\nyou from misery and destruction, Mr. Palliser has given up all his\r\ndearest hopes. He has had to sacrifice himself that he might save\r\nyou. That, I take it, is about the truth of it,--and yet you tell me\r\nthat you have done no wrong."\r\n\r\n"I never said so." Now she had come back to her chair by the window,\r\nand was again sitting in that crouching form. "I never said that I\r\nwas not wrong. Of course I was wrong. I have been so wrong throughout\r\nthat I have never been right yet. Let me tell it on to the end, and\r\nthen you can go away if you like, and tell me that I am too wicked\r\nfor your friendship."\r\n\r\n"Have I ever said anything like that, Cora?"\r\n\r\n"But you will, I dare say, when I have done. Well; what do you think\r\nmy senior duenna did,--the female one, I mean? She took my own\r\ncarriage, and posted off after Mr. Palliser as hard as ever she could,\r\nleaving the male duenna on the watch. I was dancing as hard as I\r\ncould, but I knew what was going on all the time as well as though\r\nI had heard them talking. Of course Mr. Palliser came after me. I\r\ndon\'t know what else he could do, unless, indeed, he had left me to\r\nmy fate. He came there, and behaved so well,--so much like a perfect\r\ngentleman. Of course I went home, and I was prepared to tell him\r\neverything, if he spoke a word to me,--that I intended to leave him,\r\nand that cart-ropes should not hold me!"\r\n\r\n"To leave him, Cora!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and go with that other man whose name you won\'t let me mention.\r\nI had a letter from him in my pocket asking me to go. He asked me\r\na dozen times that night. I cannot think how it was that I did not\r\nconsent."\r\n\r\n"That you did not consent to your own ruin and disgrace?"\r\n\r\n"That I did not consent to go off with him,--anywhere. Of course it\r\nwould have been my own destruction. I\'m not such a fool as not to\r\nknow that. Do you suppose I have never thought of it;--what it would\r\nbe to be a man\'s mistress instead of his wife. If I had not I should\r\nbe a thing to be hated and despised. When once I had done it I should\r\nhate and despise myself. I should feel myself to be loathsome, and,\r\nas it were, a beast among women. But why did they not let me marry\r\nhim, instead of driving me to this? And though I might have destroyed\r\nmyself, I should have saved the man who is still my husband. Do you\r\nknow, I told him all that,--told him that if I had gone away with\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald he would have another wife, and would have children,\r\nand would--?"\r\n\r\n"You told your husband that you had thought of leaving him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I told him everything. I told him that I dearly loved that poor\r\nfellow, for whom, as I believe, nobody else on earth cares a single\r\nstraw."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you what he said, only that we are all to go to Baden\r\ntogether, and then to Italy. But he did not seem a bit angry; he very\r\nseldom is angry, unless at some trumpery thing, as when he threw the\r\nbook away. And when I told him that he might have another wife and a\r\nchild, he put his arm round me and whispered to me that he did not\r\ncare so much about it as I had imagined. I felt more like loving him\r\nat that moment than I had ever done before."\r\n\r\n"He must be fit to be an angel."\r\n\r\n"He\'s fit to be a cabinet minister, which, I\'m quite sure, he\'d like\r\nmuch better. And now you know everything; but no,--there is one thing\r\nyou don\'t know yet. When I tell you that, you\'ll want to make him\r\nan archangel or a prime minister. \'We\'ll go abroad,\' he said,--and\r\nremember, this was his own proposition, made long before I was able\r\nto speak a word;--\'We\'ll go abroad, and you shall get your cousin\r\nAlice to go with us.\' That touched me more than anything. Only think\r\nif he had proposed Mrs. Marsham!"\r\n\r\n"But yet he does not like me."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong there, Alice. There has been no question of liking or\r\nof disliking. He thought you would be a kind of Mrs. Marsham, and\r\nwhen you were not, but went out flirting among the ruins with Jeffrey\r\nPalliser, instead--"\r\n\r\n"I never went out flirting with Jeffrey Palliser."\r\n\r\n"He did with you, which is all the same thing. And when Plantagenet\r\nknew of that,--for, of course, Mr. Bott told him--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott can\'t see everything."\r\n\r\n"Those men do. The worst is, they see more than everything. But, at\r\nany rate, Mr. Palliser has got over all that now. Come, Alice; the\r\nfact of the offer having come from himself should disarm you of any\r\nsuch objection as that. As he has held out his hand to you, you have\r\nno alternative but to take it."\r\n\r\n"I will take his hand willingly."\r\n\r\n"And for my sake you will go with us? He understands himself that\r\nI am not fit to be his companion, and to have no companion but him.\r\nNow there is a spirit of wisdom about you that will do for him, and\r\na spirit of folly that will suit me. I can manage to put myself on a\r\npar with a girl who has played such a wild game with her lovers as\r\nyou have done."\r\n\r\nAlice would give no promise then. Her first objection was that\r\nshe had undertaken to go down to Westmoreland and comfort Kate\r\nin the affliction of her broken arm. "And I must go," said Alice,\r\nremembering how necessary it was that she should plead her own cause\r\nwith George Vavasor\'s sister. But she acknowledged that she had not\r\nintended to stay long in Westmoreland, probably not more than a week,\r\nand it was at last decided that the Pallisers should postpone their\r\njourney for four or five days, and that Alice should go with them\r\nimmediately upon her return from Vavasor Hall.\r\n\r\n"I have no objection;" said her father, speaking with that voice\r\nof resignation which men use when they are resolved to consider\r\nthemselves injured whatever may be done. "I can get along in\r\nlodgings. I suppose we had better leave the house, as you have given\r\naway so much of your own fortune?" Alice did not think it worth her\r\nwhile to point out to him, in answer to this, that her contribution\r\nto their joint housekeeping should still remain the same as ever.\r\nSuch, however, she knew would be the fact, and she knew also that she\r\nwould find her father in the old house when she returned from her\r\ntravels. To her, in her own great troubles, the absence from London\r\nwould be as serviceable as it could be to Lady Glencora. Indeed, she\r\nhad already begun to feel the impossibility of staying quietly at\r\nhome. She could lecture her cousin, whose faults were open, easy to\r\nbe defined, and almost loud in their nature; but she was not on that\r\naccount the less aware of her own. She knew that she too had cause to\r\nbe ashamed of herself. She was half afraid to show her face among her\r\nfriends, and wept grievously over her own follies. Those cruel words\r\nof her father rang in her ears constantly:--"Things of that sort are\r\nso often over with you." The reproach, though cruel, was true, and\r\nwhat reproach more galling could be uttered to an unmarried girl such\r\nas was Alice Vavasor? She had felt from the first moment in which the\r\nproposition was made to her, that it would be well that she should\r\nfor a while leave her home, and especially that drawing-room in Queen\r\nAnne Street, which told her so many tales that she would fain forget,\r\nif it were possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser would not allow his wife to remain in London for the ten\r\nor twelve days which must yet elapse before they started, nor could\r\nhe send her into the country alone. He took her down to Matching\r\nPriory, having obtained leave to be absent from the House for the\r\nremainder of the Session, and remained with her there till within\r\ntwo days of their departure. That week down at Matching, as she\r\nafterwards told Alice, was very terrible. He never spoke a word to\r\nrebuke her. He never hinted that there had been aught in her conduct\r\nof which he had cause to complain. He treated her with a respect that\r\nwas perfect, and indeed with more outward signs of affection than\r\nhad ever been customary with him. "But," as Lady Glencora afterwards\r\nexpressed it, "he was always looking after me. I believe he thought\r\nthat Burgo Fitzgerald had hidden himself among the ruins," she said\r\nonce to Alice. "He never suspected me, I am sure of that; but he\r\nthought that he ought to look after me." And Lady Glencora in this\r\nhad very nearly hit the truth. Mr. Palliser had resolved, from that\r\nhour in which he had walked out among the elms in Kensington Gardens,\r\nthat he would neither suspect his wife, nor treat her as though he\r\nsuspected her. The blame had been his, perhaps, more than it had\r\nbeen hers. So much he had acknowledged to himself, thinking of the\r\nconfession she had made to him before their marriage. But it was\r\nmanifestly his imperative duty,--his duty of duties,--to save her\r\nfrom that pitfall into which, as she herself had told him, she had\r\nbeen so ready to fall. For her sake and for his this must be done.\r\nIt was a duty so imperative, that in its performance he had found\r\nhimself forced to abandon his ambition. To have his wife taken from\r\nhim would be terrible, but the having it said all over the world that\r\nsuch a misfortune had come upon him would be almost more terrible\r\neven than that.\r\n\r\nSo he went with his wife hither and thither, down at Matching,\r\nallowing himself to be driven about behind Dandy and Flirt. He\r\nhimself proposed these little excursions. They were tedious to him,\r\nbut doubly tedious to his wife, who now found it more difficult than\r\never to talk to him. She struggled to talk, and he struggled to talk,\r\nbut the very struggles themselves made the thing impossible. He sat\r\nwith her in the mornings, and he sat with her in the evenings; he\r\nbreakfasted with her, lunched with her, and dined with her. He went\r\nto bed early, having no figures which now claimed his attention. And\r\nso the week at last wore itself away. "I saw him yawning sometimes,"\r\nLady Glencora said afterwards, "as though he would fall in pieces."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nMr. John Grey in Queen Anne Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice was resolved that she would keep her promise to Kate, and pay\r\nher visit to Westmoreland before she started with the Pallisers. Kate\r\nhad written to her three lines with her left hand, begging her to\r\ncome, and those three lines had been more eloquent than anything\r\nshe could have written had her right arm been uninjured. Alice had\r\nlearned something of the truth as to the accident from her father;\r\nor, rather, had heard her father\'s surmises on the subject. She had\r\nheard, too, how her cousin George had borne himself when the will was\r\nread, and how he had afterwards disappeared, never showing himself\r\nagain at the hall. After all that had passed she felt that she owed\r\nKate some sympathy. Sympathy may, no doubt, be conveyed by letter;\r\nbut there are things on which it is almost impossible for any writer\r\nto express himself with adequate feeling; and there are things,\r\ntoo, which can be spoken, but which cannot be written. Therefore,\r\nthough the journey must be a hurried one, Alice sent word down to\r\nWestmoreland that she was to be expected there in a day or two. On\r\nher return she was to go at once to Park Lane, and sleep there for\r\nthe two nights which would intervene before the departure of the\r\nPallisers.\r\n\r\nOn the day before she started for Westmoreland her father came to her\r\nin the middle of the day, and told her that John Grey was going to\r\ndine with him in Queen Anne Street on that evening.\r\n\r\n"To-day, papa?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to-day. Why not? No man is less particular as to what he eats\r\nthan Grey."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of that, papa," she said.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Vavasor made no reply, but stood for some minutes looking\r\nout of the window. Then he prepared to leave the room, getting\r\nhimself first as far as the table, where he lifted a book, and then\r\non half-way to the door before Alice arrested him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, papa, you and Mr. Grey had better dine alone."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by alone?"\r\n\r\n"I meant without me,--as two men generally like to do."\r\n\r\n"If I wanted that I should have asked him to dine at the club," said\r\nMr. Vavasor, and then he again attempted to go.\r\n\r\n"But, papa--"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear! If you mean to say that because of what has\r\npassed you object to meet Mr. Grey, I can only tell you it\'s\r\nnonsense,--confounded nonsense. If he chooses to come there can be\r\nno reason why you shouldn\'t receive him."\r\n\r\n"It will look as though--"\r\n\r\n"Look what?"\r\n\r\n"As though he were asked as my guest."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense. I saw him yesterday, and I asked him to come. I saw\r\nhim again to-day, and he said he would come. He\'s not such a fool as\r\nto suppose after that, that you asked him."\r\n\r\n"No; not that I asked him."\r\n\r\n"And if you run away you\'ll only make more of the thing than it\'s\r\nworth. Of course I can\'t make you dine with me if you don\'t like."\r\n\r\nAlice did not like it, but, after some consideration, she thought\r\nthat she might be open to the imputation of having made more of the\r\nthing than it was worth if she ran away, as her father called it. She\r\nwas going to leave the country for some six or eight months,--perhaps\r\nfor a longer time than that, and it might be as well that she should\r\nhave an opportunity of telling her plans to Mr. Grey. She could do it,\r\nshe thought, in such a way as to make him understand that her last\r\nquarrel with George Vavasor was not supposed to alter the footing on\r\nwhich she stood with him. She did not doubt that her father had told\r\neverything to Mr. Grey. She knew well enough what her father\'s wishes\r\nstill were. It was not odd that he should be asking John Grey to\r\nhis house, though such exercises of domestic hospitality were very\r\nunusual with him. But,--so she declared to herself,--such little\r\nattempts on his part would be altogether thrown away. It was a pity\r\nthat he had not yet learned to know her better. She would receive\r\nMr. Grey as the mistress of her father\'s house now, for the last\r\ntime; and then, on her return in the following year, he would be at\r\nNethercoats, and the whole thing would be over.\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself very plainly, simply changing one black frock\r\nfor another, and then sat herself in her drawing-room awaiting the\r\ntwo gentlemen. It was already past the hour of dinner before her\r\nfather came up-stairs. She knew that he was in the house, and in\r\nher heart she accused him of keeping out of the way, in order that\r\nJohn Grey might be alone with her. Whether or no she were right in\r\nher suspicions John Grey did not take advantage of the opportunity\r\noffered to him. Her father came up first, and had seated himself\r\nsilently in his arm-chair before the visitor was announced.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Grey entered the room Alice knew that she was flurried, but\r\nstill she managed to carry herself with some dignity. His bearing was\r\nperfect. But then, as she declared to herself afterwards, no possible\r\nposition in life would put him beside himself. He came up to her\r\nwith his usual quiet smile,--a smile that was genial even in its\r\nquietness, and took her hand. He took it fairly and fully into his;\r\nbut there was no squeezing, no special pressure, no love-making.\r\nAnd when he spoke to her he called her Alice, as though his doing\r\nso was of all things the most simply a matter of course. There was\r\nno tell-tale hesitation in his voice. When did he ever hesitate at\r\nanything? "I hear you are going abroad," he said, "with your cousin,\r\nLady Glencora Palliser."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She managed to carry herself with some dignity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Alice; "I am going with them for a long tour. We shall\r\nnot return, I fancy, till the end of next winter."\r\n\r\n"Plans of that sort are as easily broken as they are made," said her\r\nfather. "You won\'t be your own mistress; and I advise you not to\r\ncount too surely upon getting further than Baden."\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Palliser changes his mind of course I shall come home," said\r\nAlice, with a little attempt at a smile.\r\n\r\n"I should think him a man not prone to changes," said Grey. "But all\r\nLondon is talking about his change of mind at this moment. They say\r\nat the clubs that he might have been in the Cabinet if he would, but\r\nthat he has taken up this idea of going abroad at the moment when he\r\nwas wanted."\r\n\r\n"It\'s his wife\'s doing, I take it," said Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the worst of being in Parliament," said Grey. "A man can\'t do\r\nanything without giving a reason for it. There must be men for public\r\nlife, of course; but, upon my word, I think we ought to be very much\r\nobliged to them."\r\n\r\nAlice, as she took her old lover\'s arm, and walked down with him to\r\ndinner, thought of all her former quarrels with him on this very\r\nsubject. On this very point she had left him. He had never argued the\r\nmatter with her. He had never asked her to argue with him. He had not\r\ncondescended so far as that. Had he done so, she thought that she\r\nwould have brought herself to think as he thought. She would have\r\nstriven, at any rate, to do so. But she could not become unambitious,\r\ntranquil, fond of retirement, and philosophic, without an argument\r\non the matter,--without being allowed even the poor grace of owning\r\nherself to be convinced. If a man takes a dog with him from the\r\ncountry up to town, the dog must live a town life without knowing the\r\nreason why;--must live a town life or die a town death. But a woman\r\nshould not be treated like a dog. "Had he deigned to discuss it with\r\nme!" Alice had so often said. "But, no; he will read his books, and I\r\nam to go there to fetch him his slippers, and make his tea for him."\r\nAll this came upon her again as she walked down-stairs by his side;\r\nand with it there came a consciousness that she had been driven by\r\nthis usage into the terrible engagement which she had made with her\r\ncousin. That, no doubt, was now over. There was no longer to her any\r\nquestion of her marrying George Vavasor. But the fact that she had\r\nbeen mad enough to think and talk of such a marriage, had of itself\r\nbeen enough to ruin her. "Things of that sort are so often over with\r\nyou!" After such a speech as that to her from her father, Alice\r\ntold herself that there could be no more "things of that sort" for\r\nher. But all her misery had been brought about by this scornful\r\nsuperiority to the ordinary pursuits of the world,--this looking down\r\nupon humanity. "It seems to me," she said, very quietly, while her\r\nhand was yet upon his arm, "that your pity is hardly needed. I should\r\nthink that no persons can be happier than those whom you call our\r\npublic men."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said he, "that is our old quarrel." He said it as though\r\nthe quarrel had simply been an argument between them, or a dozen\r\narguments,--as arguments do come up between friends; not as though\r\nit had served to separate for life two persons who had loved each\r\nother dearly. "It\'s the old story of the town mouse and the country\r\nmouse,--as old as the hills. Mice may be civil for a while, and\r\ncompliment each other; but when they come to speak their minds\r\nfreely, each likes his own life best." She said nothing more at the\r\nmoment, and the three sat down to their small dinner-table. It was\r\nastonishing to Alice that he should be able to talk in this way, to\r\nhint at such things, to allude to their former hopes and present\r\ncondition, without a quiver in his voice, or, as far as she could\r\nperceive, without any feeling in his heart.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said her father, "I can\'t compliment your cook upon her\r\nsoup."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t encourage her, papa, by eating it often enough. And then\r\nyou only told me at two o\'clock to-day."\r\n\r\n"If a cook can\'t make soup between two and seven, she can\'t make it\r\nin a week."\r\n\r\n"I hope Mr. Grey will excuse it," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it good?" said he. "I won\'t say that it is, because I should\r\nbe pretending to have an opinion; but I should not have found out\r\nanything against it of myself."\r\n\r\n"Where do you dine usually, now you are in London?" Mr. Vavasor asked.\r\n\r\n"At the old club, at the corner of Suffolk Street. It\'s the oldest\r\nclub in London, I believe. I never belonged to any other, and\r\ntherefore can\'t compare them; but I can\'t imagine anything much\r\nnicer."\r\n\r\n"They give you better soup than ours?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve an excellent cook," said Mr. Vavasor, with great gravity; "one\r\nof the best second-class cooks in London. We were very nearly getting\r\nhim, but you nicked him just in time. I know him well."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great deal more than I do, or hope to do. There\'s another\r\nbranch of public life for which I\'m quite unfitted. I\'d as soon be\r\ncalled on to choose a Prime Minister for the country, as I would a\r\ncook for a club."\r\n\r\n"Of course you would," said Mr. Vavasor. "There may be as many as a\r\ndozen cooks about London to be looked up, but there are never more\r\nthan two possible Prime Ministers about. And as one of them must be\r\ngoing out when the other is coming in, I don\'t see that there can be\r\nany difficulty. Moreover, now-a-days, people do their politics for\r\nthemselves, but they expect to have their dinners cooked for them."\r\n\r\nThe little dinner went on quietly and very easily. Mr. Vavasor found\r\nfault with nearly everything. But as, on this occasion, the meat\r\nand the drink, with the manner of the eating and drinking, did not\r\nconstitute the difficulty, Alice was indifferent to her father\'s\r\ncensures. The thing needed was that she and Mr. Grey should be able\r\nto sit together at the same table without apparent consciousness of\r\ntheir former ties. Alice felt that she was succeeding indifferently\r\nwell while she was putting in little mock defences for the cook. And\r\nas for John Grey, he succeeded so well that his success almost made\r\nAlice angry with him. It required no effort with him at all to be\r\nsuccessful in this matter. "If he can forget all that has passed,\r\nso much the better," said Alice to herself when she got up into the\r\ndrawing-room. Then she sat herself down on the sofa, and cried. Oh!\r\nwhat had she not lost! Had any woman ever been so mad, so reckless,\r\nso heartless as she had been! And she had done it, knowing that she\r\nloved him! She cried bitterly, and then went away to wash her eyes,\r\nthat she might be ready to give him his coffee when he should come\r\nup-stairs.\r\n\r\n"She does not look well," said Grey as soon as she had left the room.\r\n\r\n"Well;--no: how can she look well after what she has gone through?\r\nI sometimes think, that of all the people I ever knew, she has been\r\nthe most foolish. But, of course, it is not for me to say anything\r\nagainst my own child; and, of all people, not to you."\r\n\r\n"Nothing that you could say against her would make any difference to\r\nme. I sometimes fancy that I know her better than you do."\r\n\r\n"And you think that she\'ll still come round again?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that I think so. No one can venture to say whether or\r\nnot such wounds as hers may be cured. There are hearts and bodies\r\nso organized, that in them severe wounds are incurable, whereas in\r\nothers no injury seems to be fatal. But I can say that if she be not\r\ncured it shall not be from want of perseverance on my part."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Grey, I don\'t know how to thank you enough. I don\'t,\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t seem to me to be a case for thanking."\r\n\r\n"Of course it isn\'t. I know that well enough. And in the ordinary\r\nway of the world no father would think of thanking a man for wanting\r\nto marry his daughter. But things have come to such a pass with us,\r\nthat, by George! I don\'t feel like any other father. I don\'t mind\r\nsaying anything to you, you know. That claret isn\'t very good, but\r\nyou might as well take another glass."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I will. I should have said that that was rather good\r\nwine, now."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not just the thing. What\'s the use of my having good wine here,\r\nwhen nobody comes to drink it? But, as I was saying about Alice, of\r\ncourse I\'ve felt all this thing very much. I feel as though I were\r\nresponsible, and yet what could I do? She\'s her own mistress through\r\nit all. When she told me she was going to marry that horrible\r\nmiscreant, my nephew, what could I do?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s over now, and we need not talk about it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you to say so,--very. I believe she\'s a good girl.\r\nI do, indeed, in spite of it all."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt of her being what you call a good girl,--none in the\r\nleast. What she has done to me does not impair her goodness. I don\'t\r\nthink you have ever understood how much all this has been a matter of\r\nconscience with her."\r\n\r\n"Conscience!" said the angry father. "I hate such conscience. I\r\nlike the conscience that makes a girl keep her word, and not bring\r\ndisgrace upon those she belongs to."\r\n\r\n"I shall not think that I am disgraced," said Grey, quietly, "if\r\nshe will come and be my wife. She has meant to do right, and has\r\nendeavoured to take care of the happiness of other people rather than\r\nher own."\r\n\r\n"She has taken very little care of mine," said Mr. Vavasor.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be at all afraid to trust mine to her,--if she will let\r\nme do so. But she has been wounded sorely, and it must take time."\r\n\r\n"And, in the meantime, what are we to do when she tells us that\r\nMr. George Vavasor wants another remittance? Two thousand pounds a\r\nquarter comes heavy, you know!"\r\n\r\n"Let us hope that he has had enough."\r\n\r\n"Enough! Did such a man ever have enough?"\r\n\r\n"Let us hope, then, that she thinks he has had enough. Come;--may I\r\ngo up-stairs?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I\'ll follow you. She\'ll think that I mean something if I\r\nleave you together."\r\n\r\nFrom all this it will be seen that Alice\'s father and her lover still\r\nstood together on confidential terms. Not easily had Mr. Vavasor\r\nbrought himself to speak of his daughter to John Grey, in such\r\nlanguage as he had now used; but he had been forced by adverse\r\ncircumstances to pass the Rubicon of parental delicacy; he had been\r\ndriven to tell his wished-for son-in-law that he did wish to have him\r\nas a son-in-law; he had been compelled to lay aside those little airs\r\nof reserve with which a father generally speaks of his daughter,--and\r\nnow all was open between them.\r\n\r\n"And you really start to-morrow?" said Grey, as he stood close\r\nover Alice\'s work-table. Mr. Vavasor had followed him into the\r\ndrawing-room, but had seated himself in an easy-chair on the other\r\nside of the fire. There was no tone of whispering in Grey\'s voice,\r\nbut yet he spoke in a manner which showed that he did not intend to\r\nbe audible on the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n"I start for Westmoreland to-morrow. We do not leave London for the\r\ncontinent till the latter end of next week."\r\n\r\n"But you will not be here again?"\r\n\r\n"No; I shall not come back to Queen Anne Street."\r\n\r\n"And you will be away for many months?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser talked of next Easter as the term of his return. He\r\nmentioned Easter to Lady Glencora. I have not seen him myself since\r\nI agreed to go with him."\r\n\r\n"What should you say if you met me somewhere in your travels?" He had\r\nnow gently seated himself on the sofa beside her;--not so close to\r\nher as to give her just cause to move away, but yet so near as to\r\nmake his conversation with her quite private.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that will be very likely," she replied, not knowing\r\nwhat to say.\r\n\r\n"I think it is very likely. For myself, I hate surprises. I could not\r\nbring myself to fall in upon your track unawares. I shall go abroad,\r\nbut it will not be till the late autumn, when the summer heats are\r\ngone,--and I shall endeavour to find you."\r\n\r\n"To find me, Mr. Grey!" There was a quivering in her voice, as she\r\nspoke, which she could not prevent, though she would have given\r\nworlds to prevent it. "I do not think that will be quite fair."\r\n\r\n"It will not be unfair, I think, if I give you notice of my approach.\r\nI will not fall upon you and your friends unawares."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of them. They would be glad to know you, of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"And equally, of course! or, rather, much more of course, you will\r\nnot be glad to see me? That\'s what you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that we had better not meet more than we can help."\r\n\r\n"I think differently, Alice,--quite differently. The more we meet the\r\nbetter,--that is what I think. But I will not stop to trouble you\r\nnow. Good night!" Then he got up and went away, and her father went\r\nwith him. Mr. Vavasor, as he rose from his chair, declared that he\r\nwould just walk through a couple of streets; but Alice knew that he\r\nwas gone to his club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Rocks and Valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these days Mrs. Greenow was mistress of the old Hall down in\r\nWestmoreland, and was nursing Kate assiduously through the calamity\r\nof her broken arm. There had come to be a considerable amount of\r\nconfidence between the aunt and the niece. Kate had acknowledged to\r\nher aunt that her brother had behaved badly,--very badly; and the\r\naunt had confessed to the niece that she regarded Captain Bellfield\r\nas a fit subject for compassion.\r\n\r\n"And he was violent to you, and broke your arm? I always knew it was\r\nso," Mrs. Greenow had said, speaking with reference to her nephew. But\r\nthis Kate had denied. "No," said she; "that was an accident. When he\r\nwent away and left me, he knew nothing about it. And if he had broken\r\nboth my arms I should not have cared much. I could have forgiven him\r\nthat." But that which Kate could not forgive him was the fault which\r\nshe had herself committed. For his sake she had done her best to\r\nseparate Alice and John Grey, and George had shown himself to be\r\nunworthy of the kindness of her treachery. "I would give all I have\r\nin the world to bring them together again," Kate said. "They\'ll come\r\ntogether fast enough if they like each other," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n"Alice is young still, and they tell me she\'s as good looking as\r\never. A girl with her money won\'t have far to seek for a husband,\r\neven if this paragon from Cambridgeshire should not turn up again."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know Alice, aunt."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. But I know what young women are, and I know what young\r\nmen are. All this nonsense about her cousin George,--what difference\r\nwill it make? A man like Mr. Grey won\'t care about that,--especially\r\nnot if she tells him all about it. My belief is that a girl can have\r\nanything forgiven her, if she\'ll only tell it herself."\r\n\r\nBut Kate preferred the other subject, and so, I think, did Mrs.\r\nGreenow herself. "Of course, my dear," she would say, "marriage with\r\nme, if I should marry again, would be a very different thing to your\r\nmarriage, or that of any other young person. As for love, that has\r\nbeen all over for me since poor Greenow died. I have known nothing\r\nof the softness of affection since I laid him in his cold grave, and\r\nnever can again. \'Captain Bellfield,\' I said to him, \'if you were to\r\nkneel at my feet for years, it would not make me care for you in the\r\nway of love.\'"\r\n\r\n"And what did he say to that?"\r\n\r\n"How am I to tell you what he said? He talked nonsense about my\r\nbeauty, as all the men do. If a woman were hump-backed, and had only\r\none eye, they wouldn\'t be ashamed to tell her she was a Venus."\r\n\r\n"But, aunt, you are a handsome woman, you know."\r\n\r\n"Laws, my dear, as if I didn\'t understand all about it; as if I\r\ndidn\'t know what makes a woman run after? It isn\'t beauty,--and it\r\nisn\'t money altogether. I\'ve seen women who had plenty of both, and\r\nnot a man would come nigh them. They didn\'t dare. There are some of\r\nthem, a man would as soon think of putting his arm round a poplar\r\ntree, they are so hard and so stiff. You know you\'re a little that\r\nway yourself, Kate, and I\'ve always told you it won\'t do."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m too old to mend, aunt."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, if you\'ll only set your wits to work and try. You\'ve\r\nplenty of money now, and you\'re good-looking enough, too, when you\r\ntake the trouble to get yourself up. But, as I said before, it isn\'t\r\nthat that\'s wanted. There\'s a stand-off about some women,--what the\r\nmen call a \'nollimy tangere,\' that a man must be quite a furious\r\nOrlando to attempt to get the better of it. They look as though\r\nmatrimony itself were improper, and as if they believed that little\r\nbabies were found about in the hedges and ditches. They talk of women\r\nbeing forward! There are some of them a deal too backward, according\r\nto my way of thinking."\r\n\r\n"Yours is a comfortable doctrine, aunt."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I want it to be. I want things to be comfortable.\r\nWhy shouldn\'t things be nice about one when one\'s got the means?\r\nNobody can say it\'s a pleasant thing to live alone. I always thought\r\nthat man in the song hit it off properly. You remember what he says?\r\n\'The poker and tongs to each other belongs.\' So they do, and that\r\nshould be the way with men and women."\r\n\r\n"But the poker and tongs have but a bad life of it sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Not so often as the people say, my dear. Men and women ain\'t like\r\nlumps of sugar. They don\'t melt because the water is sometimes warm.\r\nNow, if I do take Bellfield,--and I really think I shall; but if I\r\ndo he\'ll give me a deal of trouble. I know he will. He\'ll always\r\nbe wanting my money, and, of course, he\'ll get more than he ought.\r\nI\'m not a Solomon, nor yet a Queen of Sheba, no more than anybody\r\nelse. And he\'ll smoke too many cigars, and perhaps drink more\r\nbrandy-and-water than he ought. And he\'ll be making eyes, too, at\r\nsome of the girls who\'ll be fools enough to let him."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, aunt, if I thought all that ill of him, I\'m sure I wouldn\'t\r\nmarry him;--especially as you say you don\'t love him."\r\n\r\n"As for love, my dear, that\'s gone,--clear gone!" Whereupon Mrs.\r\nGreenow put up her handkerchief to her eyes. "Some women can love\r\ntwice, but I am not one of them. I wish I could,--I wish I could!"\r\nThese last words were spoken in a tone of solemn regret, which,\r\nhowever, she contrived to change as quickly as she had adopted it.\r\n"But my dear, marriage is a comfortable thing. And then, though\r\nthe Captain may be a little free, I don\'t doubt but what I shall\r\nget the upper hand with him at last. I shan\'t stop his cigars and\r\nbrandy-and-water you know. Why shouldn\'t a man smoke and have a\r\nglass, if he don\'t make a beast of himself? I like to see a man enjoy\r\nhimself. And then," she added, speaking tenderly of her absent lover,\r\n"I do think he\'s fond of me,--I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"So is Mr. Cheesacre for the matter of that."\r\n\r\n"Poor Cheesy! I believe he was, though he did talk so much about\r\nmoney. I always like to believe the best I can of them. But then\r\nthere was no poetry about Cheesy. I don\'t care about saying it now,\r\nas you\'ve quite made up your mind not to have him."\r\n\r\n"Quite, aunt."\r\n\r\n"Your grandfather\'s will does make a difference, you know. But, as\r\nI was saying, I do like a little romance about them,--just a sniff,\r\nas I call it, of the rocks and valleys. One knows that it doesn\'t\r\nmean much; but it\'s like artificial flowers,--it gives a little\r\ncolour, and takes off the dowdiness. Of course, bread-and-cheese is\r\nthe real thing. The rocks and valleys are no good at all, if you\r\nhaven\'t got that, But enough is as good as a feast. Thanks to dear\r\nGreenow,"--here the handkerchief was again used--"Thanks to dear\r\nGreenow, I shall never want. Of course I shan\'t let any of the money\r\ngo into his hands,--the Captain\'s, I mean. I know a trick worth two\r\nof that, my dear. But, lord love you! I\'ve enough for him and me.\r\nWhat\'s the good of a woman\'s wanting to keep it all to herself?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sniff of the rocks and valleys.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"And you think you\'ll really take him, aunt, and pay his\r\nwasherwoman\'s bills for him? You remember what you told me when I\r\nfirst saw him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I remember. And if he can\'t pay his own washerwoman, isn\'t\r\nthat so much more of a reason that I should do it for him? Well; yes;\r\nI think I will take him. That is, if he lets me take him just as I\r\nchoose. Beggars mustn\'t be choosers, my dear."\r\n\r\nIn this way the aunt and niece became very confidential, and Mrs.\r\nGreenow whispered into Kate\'s ears her belief that Captain Bellfield\r\nmight possibly make his way across the country to Westmoreland.\r\n"There would be no harm in offering him a bed, would there?" Mrs.\r\nGreenow asked. "You see the inn at Shap is a long way off for morning\r\ncalls." Kate could not take upon herself to say that there would be\r\nany harm, but she did not like the idea of having Captain Bellfield\r\nas a visitor. "After all, perhaps he mayn\'t come," said the widow. "I\r\ndon\'t see where he is to raise the money for such a journey, now that\r\nhe has quarrelled with Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\n"If Captain Bellfield must come to Vavasor Hall, at any rate let him\r\nnot come till Alice\'s visit had been completed." That was Kate\'s\r\npresent wish, and so much she ventured to confide to her aunt. But\r\nthere seemed to be no way of stopping him. "I don\'t in the least know\r\nwhere he is, my dear, and as for writing to him, I never did such a\r\nthing in my life, and I shouldn\'t know how to begin." Mrs. Greenow\r\ndeclared that she had not positively invited the Captain; but on this\r\npoint Kate hardly gave full credit to her aunt\'s statement.\r\n\r\nAlice arrived, and, for a day or two, the three ladies lived very\r\npleasantly together. Kate still wore her arm in a sling; but she was\r\nable to walk out, and would take long walks in spite of the doctor\'s\r\nprohibition. Of course, they went up on the mountains. Indeed, all\r\nthe walks from Vavasor Hall led to the mountains, unless one chose to\r\ntake the road to Shap. But they went up, across the beacon hill, as\r\nthough by mutual consent. There were no questions asked between them\r\nas to the route to be taken; and though they did not reach the stone\r\non which they had once sat looking over upon Haweswater, they did\r\nreach the spot upon which Kate had encountered her accident. "It was\r\nhere I fell," she said; "and the last I saw of him was his back, as\r\nhe made his way down into the valley, there. When I got upon my legs\r\nI could still see him. It was one of those evenings when the clouds\r\nare dark, but you can see all objects with a peculiar clearness\r\nthrough the air. I stood here ever so long, holding my arm, and\r\nwatching him; but he never once turned to look back at me. Do you\r\nknow, Alice, I fancy that I shall never see him again."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose that he means to quarrel with you altogether?"\r\n\r\n"I can hardly tell you what I mean! He seemed to me to be going away\r\nfrom me, as though he went into another world. His figure against the\r\nlight was quite clear, and he walked quickly, and on he went, till\r\nthe slope of the hill hid him from me. Of course, I thought that he\r\nwould return to the Hall. At one time I almost feared that he would\r\ncome upon me through the woods, as I went back myself. But yet, I had\r\na feeling,--what people call a presentiment, that I should never see\r\nhim again."\r\n\r\n"He has never written?"\r\n\r\n"No; not a word. You must remember that he did not know that I had\r\nhurt myself. I am sure he will not write, and I am sure, also, that I\r\nshall not. If he wanted money I would send it to him, but I would not\r\nwrite to him."\r\n\r\n"I fear he will always want money, Kate."\r\n\r\n"I fear he will. If you could know what I suffered when he made me\r\nwrite that letter to you! But, of course, I was a beast. Of course,\r\nI ought not to have written it."\r\n\r\n"I thought it a very proper letter."\r\n\r\n"It was a mean letter. The whole thing was mean! He should have\r\nstarved in the street before he had taken your money. He should have\r\ngiven up Parliament, and everything else! I had doubted much about\r\nhim before, but it was that which first turned my heart against\r\nhim. I had begun to fear that he was not such a man as I had always\r\nthought him,--as I had spoken of him to you."\r\n\r\n"I had judged of him for myself," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Of course you did. But I had endeavoured to make you judge kindly.\r\nAlice, dear! we have both suffered for him; you more than I, perhaps;\r\nbut I, too, have given up everything for him. My whole life has\r\nbeen at his service. I have been his creature, to do his bidding,\r\njust as he might tell me. He made me do things that I knew to be\r\nwrong,--things that were foreign to my own nature; and yet I almost\r\nworshipped him. Even now, if he were to come back, I believe that I\r\nshould forgive him everything."\r\n\r\n"I should forgive him, but I could never do more."\r\n\r\n"But he will never come back. He will never ask us to forgive him, or\r\neven wish it. He has no heart."\r\n\r\n"He has longed for money till the Devil has hardened his heart," said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n"And yet how tender he could be in his manner when he chose it;--how\r\nsoft he could make his words and his looks! Do you remember how he\r\nbehaved to us in Switzerland? Do you remember that balcony at Basle,\r\nand the night we sat there, when the boys were swimming down the\r\nriver?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I remember."\r\n\r\n"So do I! So do I! Alice, I would give all I have in the world, if I\r\ncould recall that journey to Switzerland."\r\n\r\n"If you mean for my sake, Kate--"\r\n\r\n"I do mean for your sake. It made no difference to me. Whether I\r\nstayed in Westmoreland or went abroad, I must have found out that my\r\ngod was made of bricks and clay instead of gold. But there was no\r\nneed for you to be crushed in the ruins."\r\n\r\n"I am not crushed, Kate!"\r\n\r\n"Of course, you are too proud to own it?"\r\n\r\n"If you mean about Mr. Grey, that would have happened just the same,\r\nwhether I had gone abroad or remained at home."\r\n\r\n"Would it, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Just the same."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more than this said between them about Mr. Grey.\r\nEven to her cousin, Alice could not bring herself to talk freely on\r\nthat subject. She would never allow herself to think, for a moment,\r\nthat she had been persuaded by others to treat him as she had treated\r\nhim. She was sure that she had acted on her own convictions of what\r\nwas right and wrong; and now, though she had begun to feel that she\r\nhad been wrong, she would hardly confess as much even to herself.\r\n\r\nThey walked back, down the hill, to the Hall in silence for the\r\ngreater part of the way. Once or twice Kate repeated her conviction\r\nthat she should never again see her brother. "I do not know what may\r\nhappen to him," she said in answer to her cousin\'s questions; "but\r\nwhen he was passing out of my sight into the valley, I felt that I\r\nwas looking at him for the last time."\r\n\r\n"That is simply what people call a presentiment," Alice replied.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so; and presentiments, of course, mean nothing," said Kate.\r\n\r\nThen they walked on towards the house without further speech; but\r\nwhen they reached the end of the little path which led out of the\r\nwood, on to the gravelled sweep before the front door, they were both\r\narrested by a sight that met their eyes. There was a man standing,\r\nwith a cigar in his mouth, before them, swinging a little cane,\r\nand looking about him up at the wood. He had on his head a jaunty\r\nlittle straw-hat, and he wore a jacket with brass buttons, and white\r\ntrousers. It was now nearly the middle of May, but the summer does\r\nnot come to Westmoreland so early as that, and the man, as he stood\r\nthere looking about him, seemed to be cold and almost uncomfortable.\r\nHe had not as yet seen the two girls, who stood at the end of the\r\nwalk, arrested by the sight of him. "Who is it?" asked Alice, in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n"Captain Bellfield," said Kate, speaking with something very like\r\ndismay in her voice.\r\n\r\n"What! aunt Greenow\'s Captain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; aunt Greenow\'s Captain. I have been fearing this, and now, what\r\non earth are we to do with him? Look at him. That\'s what aunt Greenow\r\ncalls a sniff of the rocks and valleys."\r\n\r\nThe Captain began to move,--just to move, as though it were necessary\r\nto do something to keep the life in his limbs. He had finished his\r\ncigar, and looked at the end of it with manifest regret. As he threw\r\nit away among a tuft of shrubs his eye fell upon the two ladies, and\r\nhe uttered a little exclamation. Then he came forward, waving his\r\nlittle straw-hat in his hand, and made his salutation. "Miss Vavasor,\r\nI am delighted," he said. "Miss Alice Vavasor, if I am not mistaken?\r\nI have been commissioned by my dear friend Mrs. Greenow to go out and\r\nseek you, but, upon my word, the woods looked so black that I did not\r\ndare to venture;--and then, of course, I shouldn\'t have found you."\r\n\r\nKate put out her left hand, and then introduced her cousin to the\r\nCaptain. Again he waved his little straw-hat, and strove to bear\r\nhimself as though he were at home and comfortable. But he failed,\r\nand it was manifest that he failed. He was not the Bellfield who had\r\nconquered Mr. Cheesacre on the sands at Yarmouth, though he wore the\r\nsame jacket and waistcoat, and must now have enjoyed the internal\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that his future maintenance in life was\r\nassured to him. But he was not at his ease. His courage had sufficed\r\nto enable him to follow his quarry into Westmoreland, but it did not\r\nsuffice to make him comfortable while he was there. Kate instantly\r\nperceived his condition, and wickedly resolved that she would make no\r\neffort to assist him. She went through some ceremony of introduction,\r\nand then expressed her surprise at seeing him so far north.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he; "I am a little surprised myself;--I am, indeed! But\r\nI had nothing to do in Norwich,--literally nothing; and your aunt had\r\nso often talked to me of the beauties of this place,"--and he waved\r\nhis hand round at the old house and the dark trees,--"that I thought\r\nI\'d take the liberty of paying you a flying visit. I didn\'t mean to\r\nintrude in the way of sleeping; I didn\'t indeed, Miss Vavasor; only\r\nMrs. Greenow has been so kind as to say--"\r\n\r\n"We are so very far out of the world, Captain Bellfield, that we\r\nalways give our visitors beds."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t intend it; I didn\'t indeed, miss!" Poor Captain Bellfield\r\nwas becoming very uneasy in his agitation. "I did just put my bag,\r\nwith a change of things, into the gig, which brought me over, not\r\nknowing quite where I might go on to."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t send you any further to-day, at any rate," said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Greenow has been very kind,--very kind, indeed. She has asked me\r\nto stay till--Saturday!"\r\n\r\nKate bit her lips in a momentary fit of anger. The house was her\r\nhouse, and not her aunt\'s. But she remembered that her aunt had been\r\nkind to her at Norwich and at Yarmouth, and she allowed this feeling\r\nto die away. "We shall be very glad to see you," she said. "We are\r\nthree women together here, and I\'m afraid you will find us rather\r\ndull."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no,--dull with you! That would be impossible!"\r\n\r\n"And how have you left your friend, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"Quite well;--very well, thank you. That is to say, I haven\'t seen\r\nhim much lately. He and I did have a bit of a breeze, you know."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I did know, Captain Bellfield."\r\n\r\n"I thought, perhaps, you had heard. He seemed to think that I was too\r\nparticular in a certain quarter! Ha--ha--ha--ha! That\'s only my joke,\r\nyou know, ladies."\r\n\r\nThey then went into the house, and the Captain straggled in after\r\nthem. Mrs. Greenow was in neither of the two sitting-rooms which\r\nthey usually occupied. She, too, had been driven somewhat out of the\r\nordinary composure of her manner by the arrival of her lover,--even\r\nthough she had expected it, and had retired to her room, thinking\r\nthat she had better see Kate in private before they met in the\r\npresence of the Captain. "I suppose you have seen my aunt since you\r\nhave been here?" said Kate.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes. I saw her, and she suggested that I had better walk\r\nout and find you. I did find you, you know, though I didn\'t walk very\r\nfar."\r\n\r\n"And have you seen your room?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes. She was kind enough to show me my room. Very nice indeed,\r\nthank you;--looking out into the front, and all that kind of thing."\r\nThe poor fellow was no doubt thinking how much better was his lot at\r\nVavasor Hall than it had been at Oileymead. "I shan\'t stay long, Miss\r\nVavasor,--only just a night or so; but I did want to see your aunt\r\nagain,--and you, too, upon my word."\r\n\r\n"My aunt is the attraction, Captain Bellfield. We all know that."\r\n\r\nHe actually simpered,--simpered like a young girl who is half elated\r\nand half ashamed when her lover is thrown in her teeth. He fidgeted\r\nwith the things on the table, and moved himself about uneasily from\r\none leg to the other. Perhaps he was remembering that though he had\r\ncontrived to bring himself to Vavasor Hall he had not money enough\r\nleft to take him back to Norwich. The two girls left him and went to\r\ntheir rooms. "I will go to my aunt at once," said Kate, "and find out\r\nwhat is to be done."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she means to marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; she means to marry him, and the sooner the better now. I\r\nknew this was coming, but I did so hope it would not be while you\r\nwere here. It makes me feel so ashamed of myself that you should see\r\nit."\r\n\r\nKate boldly knocked at her aunt\'s door, and her aunt received her\r\nwith a conscious smile. "I was waiting for you to come," said Mrs.\r\nGreenow.\r\n\r\n"Here I am, aunt; and, what is more to the purpose, there is Captain\r\nBellfield in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"Stupid man! I told him to take himself away about the place till\r\ndinner-time. I\'ve half a mind to send him back to Shap at once;--upon\r\nmy word I have."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that, aunt; it would be inhospitable."\r\n\r\n"But he is such an oaf. I hope you understand, my dear, that I\r\ncouldn\'t help it?"\r\n\r\n"But you do mean to--to marry him, aunt; don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Kate, I really think I do. Why shouldn\'t I? It\'s a lonely sort\r\nof life being by myself; and, upon my word, I don\'t think there\'s\r\nvery much harm in him."\r\n\r\n"I am not saying anything against him; only in that case you can\'t\r\nvery well turn him out of the house."\r\n\r\n"Could not I, though? I could in a minute; and, if you wish it, you\r\nshall see if I can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"The rocks and valleys would not allow that, aunt."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you to laugh, my dear. If laughing would\r\nbreak my bones I shouldn\'t be as whole as I am now. I might have had\r\nCheesacre if I liked, who is a substantial man, and could have kept\r\na carriage for me; but it was the rocks and valleys that prevented\r\nthat;--and perhaps a little feeling that I might do some good to\r\na poor fellow who has nobody in the world to look after him." Mrs.\r\nGreenow, as she said this, put her handkerchief up to her eyes, and\r\nwiped away the springing moisture. Tears were always easy with her,\r\nbut on this occasion Kate almost respected her tears. "I\'m sure I\r\nhope you\'ll be happy, aunt."\r\n\r\n"If he makes me unhappy he shall pay for it;" and Mrs. Greenow, having\r\ndone with the tears, shook her head, as though upon this occasion she\r\nquite meant all that she said.\r\n\r\nAt dinner they were not very comfortable. Either the gloomy air of\r\nthe place and the neighbourhood of the black pines had depressed the\r\nCaptain, or else the glorious richness of the prospects before him\r\nhad made him thoughtful. He had laid aside the jacket with the brass\r\nbuttons, and had dressed himself for dinner very soberly. And he\r\nbehaved himself at dinner and after dinner with a wonderful sobriety,\r\nbeing very unlike the Captain who had sat at the head of the table\r\nat Mrs. Greenow\'s picnic. When left to himself after dinner he\r\nbarely swallowed two glasses of the old Squire\'s port wine before he\r\nsauntered out into the garden to join the ladies, whom he had seen\r\nthere; and when pressed by Kate to light a cigar he positively\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mrs. Greenow had recovered her composure,\r\nbut Captain Bellfield was still in a rather disturbed state of mind.\r\nHe knew that his efforts were to be crowned with success, and that\r\nhe was sure of his wife, but he did not know how the preliminary\r\ndifficulties were to be overcome, and he did not know what to do\r\nwith himself at the Hall. After breakfast he fidgeted about in the\r\nparlour, being unable to contrive for himself a mode of escape, and\r\nwas absolutely thrown upon his beam-ends when the widow asked him\r\nwhat he meant to do with himself between that and dinner.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'d better take a walk," he said; "and perhaps the young\r\nladies--"\r\n\r\n"If you mean my two nieces," said Mrs. Greenow, "I\'m afraid you\'ll\r\nfind they are engaged. But if I\'m not too old to walk with--" The\r\nCaptain assured her that she was just of the proper age for a walking\r\ncompanion, as far as his taste went, and then attempted some apology\r\nfor the awkwardness of his expression, at which the three women\r\nlaughed heartily. "Never mind, Captain," said Mrs. Greenow. "We\'ll\r\nhave our walk all the same, and won\'t mind those young girls. Come\r\nalong." They started, not up towards the mountains, as Kate always\r\ndid when she walked in Westmoreland, but mildly, and at a gentle\r\npace, as beseemed their years, along the road towards Shap. The\r\nCaptain politely opened the old gate for the widow, and then\r\ncarefully closed it again,--not allowing it to swing, as he would\r\nhave done at Yarmouth. Then he tripped up to his place beside her,\r\nsuggested his arm, which she declined, and walked on for some paces\r\nin silence. What on earth was he to say to her? He had done his\r\nlove-making successfully, and what was he to do next?\r\n\r\n"Well, Captain Bellfield," said she. They were walking very slowly,\r\nand he was cutting the weeds by the roadside with his cane. He knew\r\nby her voice that something special was coming, so he left the\r\nweeds and ranged himself close up alongside of her. "Well, Captain\r\nBellfield,--so I suppose I\'m to be good-natured; am I?"\r\n\r\n"Arabella, you\'ll make me the happiest man in the world."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all fudge." She would have said, "all rocks and valleys,"\r\nonly he would not have understood her.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you will."\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall make you respectable?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; certainly. I quite intend that."\r\n\r\n"It is the great thing that you should intend. Of course I am going\r\nto make a fool of myself."\r\n\r\n"No, no; don\'t say that."\r\n\r\n"If I don\'t say it, all my friends will say it for me. It\'s lucky for\r\nyou that I don\'t much care what people say."\r\n\r\n"It is lucky;--I know that I\'m lucky. The very first day I saw you I\r\nthought what a happy fellow I was to meet you. Then, of course, I was\r\nonly thinking of your beauty."\r\n\r\n"Get along with you!"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, yes. Come, Arabella, as we are to be man and wife, you\r\nmight as well." At this moment he had got very close to her, and had\r\nrecovered something of his usual elasticity; but she would not allow\r\nhim even to put his arm round her waist. "Out in the high road!" she\r\nsaid. "How can you be so impertinent,--and so foolish?"\r\n\r\n"You might as well, you know,--just once."\r\n\r\n"Captain Bellfield, I brought you out here not for such fooling as\r\nthat, but in order that we might have a little chat about business.\r\nIf we are to be man and wife, as you say, we ought to understand on\r\nwhat footing we are to begin together. I\'m afraid your own private\r\nmeans are not considerable?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; they are not, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"Have you anything?" The Captain hesitated, and poked the ground\r\nwith his cane. "Come, Captain Bellfield, let us have the truth at\r\nonce, and then we shall understand each other." The Captain still\r\nhesitated, and said nothing. "You must have had something to live\r\nupon, I suppose?" suggested the widow. Then the Captain, by degrees,\r\ntold his story. He had a married sister by whom a guinea a week was\r\nallowed to him. That was all. He had been obliged to sell out of the\r\narmy, because he was unable to live on his pay as a lieutenant. The\r\nprice of his commission had gone to pay his debts, and now,--yes,\r\nit was too true,--now he was in debt again. He owed ninety pounds\r\nto Cheesacre, thirty-two pounds ten to a tailor at Yarmouth, over\r\nseventeen pounds at his lodgings in Norwich. At the present moment\r\nhe had something under thirty shillings in his pocket. The tailor at\r\nYarmouth had lent him three pounds in order that he might make his\r\njourney into Westmoreland, and perhaps be enabled to pay his debts\r\nby getting a rich wife. In the course of the cross-examination Mrs.\r\nGreenow got much information out of him; and then, when she was\r\nsatisfied that she had learned, not exactly all the truth, but\r\ncertain indications of the truth, she forgave him all his offences.\r\n\r\n"And now you will give a fellow a kiss,--just one kiss," said the\r\necstatic Captain, in the height of his bliss.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said the widow, "there\'s a carriage coming on the road--close\r\nto us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nThe First Kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said the widow, "there\'s a carriage coming on the road--close\r\nto us." Mrs. Greenow, as she spoke these words, drew back from the\r\nCaptain\'s arms before the first kiss of permitted ante-nuptial love\r\nhad been exchanged. The scene was on the high road from Shap to\r\nVavasor, and as she was still dressed in all the sombre habiliments\r\nof early widowhood, and as neither he nor his sweetheart were under\r\nforty, perhaps it was as well that they were not caught toying\r\ntogether in so very public a place. But they were only just in time\r\nto escape the vigilant eyes of a new visitor. Round the corner of the\r\nroad, at a sharp trot, came the Shap post-horse, with the Shap gig\r\nbehind him,--the same gig which had brought Bellfield to Vavasor on\r\nthe previous day,--and seated in the gig, looming large, with his\r\neyes wide awake to everything round him, was--Mr. Cheesacre.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight terrible to the eyes of Captain Bellfield, and by no\r\nmeans welcome to those of Mrs. Greenow. As regarded her, her annoyance\r\nhad chiefly reference to her two nieces, and especially to Alice.\r\nHow was she to account for this second lover? Kate, of course, knew\r\nall about it; but how could Alice be made to understand that she,\r\nMrs. Greenow, was not to blame,--that she had, in sober truth, told\r\nthis ardent gentleman that there was no hope for him? And even as\r\nto Kate,--Kate, whom her aunt had absurdly chosen to regard as the\r\nobject of Mr. Cheesacre\'s pursuit,--what sort of a welcome would\r\nshe extend to the owner of Oileymead? Before the wheels had stopped,\r\nMrs. Greenow had begun to reflect whether it might be possible that\r\nshe should send Mr. Cheesacre back without letting him go on to the\r\nHall; but if Mrs. Greenow was dismayed, what were the feelings of the\r\nCaptain? For he was aware that Cheesacre knew that of him which he\r\nhad not told. How ardently did he now wish that he had sailed nearer\r\nto the truth in giving in the schedule of his debts to Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\n"That man\'s wanted by the police," said Cheesacre, speaking while the\r\ngig was still in motion. "He\'s wanted by the police, Mrs. Greenow,"\r\nand in his ardour he stood up in the gig and pointed at Bellfield.\r\nThen the gig stopped suddenly, and he fell back into his seat in his\r\neffort to prevent his falling forward. "He\'s wanted by the police,"\r\nhe shouted out again, as soon as he was able to recover his voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow turned pale beneath the widow\'s veil which she had\r\ndropped. What might not her Captain have done? He might have procured\r\nthings, to be sent to him, out of shops on false pretences; or, urged\r\non by want and famine, he might have committed--forgery. "Oh, my!"\r\nshe said, and dropped her hand from his arm, which she had taken.\r\n\r\n"It\'s false," said Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll indict you for slander, my friend," said Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"Pay me the money you owe me," said Cheesacre. "You\'re a swindler!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow cared little as to her lover being a swindler in Mr.\r\nCheesacre\'s estimation. Such accusations from him she had heard\r\nbefore. But she did care very much as to this mission of the police\r\nagainst her Captain. If that were true, the Captain could be her\r\nCaptain no longer. "What is this I hear, Captain Bellfield?" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie and a slander. He merely wants to make a quarrel between\r\nus. What police are after me, Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the police, or the sheriff\'s officer, or something of the\r\nkind," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the sheriff\'s officers!" exclaimed Mrs. Greenow, in a tone of\r\nvoice which showed how great had been her relief. "Mr. Cheesacre, you\r\nshouldn\'t come and say such things;--you shouldn\'t, indeed. Sheriff\'s\r\nofficers can be paid, and there\'s an end of them."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll indict him for the libel--I will, as sure as I\'m alive," said\r\nBellfield.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said the widow. "Don\'t you make a fool of yourself. When\r\nmen can\'t pay their way they must put up with having things like that\r\nsaid of them. Mr. Cheesacre, where were you going?"\r\n\r\n"I was going to Vavasor Hall, on purpose to caution you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late," said Mrs. Greenow, sinking behind her veil.\r\n\r\n"Why, you haven\'t been and married him since yesterday? He only had\r\ntwenty-four hours\' start of me, I know. Or, perhaps, you had it done\r\nclandestine in Norwich? Oh, Mrs. Greenow!"\r\n\r\nHe got out of the gig, and the three walked back towards the Hall\r\ntogether, while the boy drove on with Mr. Cheesacre\'s carpetbag. "I\r\nhardly know," said Mrs. Greenow, "whether we can welcome you. There\r\nare other visitors, and the house is full."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not one to intrude where I\'m not wanted. You may be sure of\r\nthat. If I can\'t get my supper for love, I can get at for money.\r\nThat\'s more than some people can say. I wonder when you\'re going to\r\npay me what you owe me, Lieutenant Bellfield?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I wonder when you\'re going to pay me what you\r\nowe me, Lieutenant Bellfield?"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the widow had contrived to reconcile the two men before\r\nshe reached the Hall. They had actually shaken hands, and the lamb\r\nCheesacre had agreed to lie down with the wolf Bellfield. Cheesacre,\r\nmoreover, had contrived to whisper into the widow\'s ears the true\r\nextent of his errand into Westmoreland. This, however, he did not do\r\naltogether in Bellfield\'s hearing. When Mrs. Greenow ascertained that\r\nthere was something to be said, she made no scruple in sending her\r\nbetrothed away from her "You won\'t throw a fellow over, will you,\r\nnow?" whispered Bellfield into her ear as he went. She merely frowned\r\nat him, and bade him begone, so that the walk which Mrs. Greenow began\r\nwith one lover she ended in company with the other.\r\n\r\nBellfield, who was sent on to the house, found Alice and Kate\r\nsurveying the newly arrived carpet bag. "He knows \'un," said the boy\r\nwho had driven the gig, pointing to the Captain.\r\n\r\n"It belongs to your old friend, Mr. Cheesacre," said Bellfield to\r\nKate.\r\n\r\n"And has he come too?" said Kate.\r\n\r\nThe Captain shrugged his shoulders, and admitted that it was hard.\r\n"And it\'s not the slightest use," said he, "not the least in the\r\nworld. He never had a chance in that quarter."\r\n\r\n"Not enough of the rocks and valleys about him, was there, Captain\r\nBellfield?" said Kate. But Captain Bellfield understood nothing about\r\nthe rocks and valleys, though he was regarded by certain eyes as\r\nbeing both a rock and a valley himself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cheesacre was telling his story. He first asked, in a\r\nmelancholy tone, whether it was really necessary that he must abandon\r\nall his hopes. "He wasn\'t going to say anything against the Captain,"\r\nhe said, "if things were really fixed. He never begrudged any man his\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"Things are really fixed," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\nHe could, however, not keep himself from hinting that Oileymead was\r\na substantial home, and that Bellfield had not as much as a straw\r\nmattress to lie upon. In answer to this Mrs. Greenow told him that\r\nthere was so much more reason why some one should provide the poor\r\nman with a mattress. "If you look at it in that light, of course it\'s\r\ntrue," said Cheesacre. Mrs. Greenow told him that she did look at it\r\nin that light. "Then I\'ve done about that," said Cheesacre; "and as\r\nto the little bit of money he owes me, I must give him his time about\r\nit, I suppose." Mrs. Greenow assured him that it should be paid as\r\nsoon as possible after the nuptial benediction had been said over\r\nthem. She offered, indeed, to pay it at once if he was in distress\r\nfor it, but he answered contemptuously that he never was in distress\r\nfor money. He liked to have his own,--that was all.\r\n\r\nAfter this he did not get away to his next subject quite so easily\r\nas he wished; and it must be admitted that there was a difficulty.\r\nAs he could not have Mrs. Greenow he would be content to put up with\r\nKate for his wife. That was his next subject. Rumours as to the old\r\nSquire\'s will had no doubt reached him, and he was now willing to\r\ntake advantage of that assistance which Mrs. Greenow had before\r\noffered him in this matter. The time had come in which he ought to\r\nmarry; of that he was aware. He had told many of his friends in\r\nNorfolk that Kate Vavasor had thrown herself at his head, and very\r\nprobably he had thought it true. In answer to all his love speeches\r\nto herself, the aunt had always told him what an excellent wife her\r\nniece would make him. So now he had come to Westmoreland with this\r\nsecond string to his bow. "You know you put it into my head your own\r\nself," pleaded Mr. Cheesacre. "Didn\'t you, now?"\r\n\r\n"But things are so different since that," said the widow.\r\n\r\n"How different? I ain\'t different. There\'s Oileymead just where it\r\nalways was, and the owner of it don\'t owe a shilling to any man. How\r\nare things different?"\r\n\r\n"My niece has inherited property."\r\n\r\n"And is that to make a change? Oh! Mrs. Greenow, who would have\r\nthought to find you mercenary like that? Inherited property! Is she\r\ngoing to fling a man over because of that?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow endeavoured to explain to him that her niece could hardly\r\nbe said to have flung him over, and at last pretended to become angry\r\nwhen he attempted to assert his position. "Why, Mr. Cheesacre, I am\r\nquite sure she never gave you a word of encouragement in her life."\r\n\r\n"But you always told me I might have her for the asking."\r\n\r\n"And now I tell you that you mayn\'t. It\'s of no use your going on\r\nthere to ask her, for she will only send you away with an answer\r\nyou won\'t like. Look here, Mr. Cheesacre; you want to get married,\r\nand it\'s quite time you should. There\'s my dear friend Charlie\r\nFairstairs. How could you get a better wife than Charlie?"\r\n\r\n"Charlie Fairstairs!" said Cheesacre, turning up his nose in disgust.\r\n"She hasn\'t got a penny, nor any one belonging to her. The man who\r\nmarries her will have to find the money for the smock she stands up\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s mercenary now, Mr. Cheesacre? Do you go home and think of it;\r\nand if you\'ll marry Charlie, I\'ll go to your wedding. You shan\'t be\r\nashamed of her clothing. I\'ll see to that."\r\n\r\nThey were now close to the gate, and Cheesacre paused before he\r\nentered. "Do you think there\'s no chance at all for me, then?" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"I know there\'s none. I\'ve heard her speak about it."\r\n\r\n"Somebody else, perhaps, is the happy man?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say anything about that, but I know that she wouldn\'t take\r\nyou. I like farming, you know, but she doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I might give that up," said Cheesacre readily,--"at any rate, for a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no; it would do no good. Believe me, my friend, that it is\r\nof no use."\r\n\r\nHe still paused at the gate. "I don\'t see what\'s the use of my going\r\nin," said he. To this she made him no answer. "There\'s a pride about\r\nme," he continued, "that I don\'t choose to go where I\'m not wanted."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you, Mr. Cheesacre, that you are wanted in that light,\r\ncertainly."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll go. Perhaps you\'ll be so good as to tell the boy with\r\nthe gig to come after me? That\'s six pound ten it will have cost me\r\nto come here and go back. Bellfield did it cheaper, of course; he\r\ntravelled second class. I heard of him as I came along."\r\n\r\n"The expense does not matter to you, Mr. Cheesacre."\r\n\r\nTo this he assented, and then took his leave, at first offering his\r\nhand to Mrs. Greenow with an air of offended dignity, but falling back\r\nalmost into humility during the performance of his adieu. Before he\r\nwas gone he had invited her to bring the Captain to Oileymead when\r\nshe was married, and had begged her to tell Miss Vavasor how happy he\r\nshould be to receive her. "And Mr. Cheesacre," said the widow, as he\r\nwalked back along the road, "don\'t forget dear Charlie Fairstairs."\r\n\r\nThey were all standing at the front door of the house when Mrs.\r\nGreenow re-appeared,--Alice, Kate, Captain Bellfield, the Shap boy,\r\nand the Shap horse and gig. "Where is he?" Kate asked in a low voice,\r\nand everyone there felt how important was the question. "He has\r\ngone," said the widow. Bellfield was so relieved that he could not\r\nrestrain his joy, but took off his little straw hat and threw it up\r\ninto the air. Kate\'s satisfaction was almost as intense. "I am so\r\nglad," said she. "What on earth should we have done with him?" "I\r\nnever was so disappointed in my life," said Alice. "I have heard so\r\nmuch of Mr. Cheesacre, but have never seen him." Kate suggested that\r\nshe should get into the gig and drive after him. "He ain\'t a been and\r\ntook hisself off?" suggested the boy, whose face became very dismal\r\nas the terrible idea struck him. But, with juvenile craft, he put his\r\nhand on the carpet-bag, and finding that it did not contain stones,\r\nwas comforted. "You drive after him, young gentleman, and you\'ll find\r\nhim on the road to Shap," said Mrs. Greenow. "Mind you give him my\r\nlove," said the Captain in his glee, "and say I hope he\'ll get his\r\nturnips in well."\r\n\r\nThis little episode went far to break the day, and did more than\r\nanything else could have done to put Captain Bellfield at his ease.\r\nIt created a little joint-stock fund of merriment between the whole\r\nparty, which was very much needed. The absence of such joint-stock\r\nfund is always felt when a small party is thrown together without\r\nsuch assistance. Some bond is necessary on these occasions, and no\r\nother bond is so easy or so pleasant. Now, when the Captain found\r\nhimself alone for a quarter of an hour with Alice, he had plenty of\r\nsubjects for small-talk. "Yes, indeed. Old Cheesacre, in spite of his\r\nabsurdities, is not a bad sort of fellow at bottom;--awfully fond of\r\nhis money, you know, Miss Vavasor, and always boasting about it."\r\n"That\'s not pleasant," said Alice. "No, the most unpleasant thing in\r\nthe world. There\'s nothing I hate so much, Miss Vavasor, as that kind\r\nof talking. My idea is this,--when a man has lots of money, let him\r\nmake the best use he can of it, and say nothing about it. Nobody ever\r\nheard me talking about my money." He knew that Alice knew that he was\r\na pauper; but, nevertheless, he had the satisfaction of speaking of\r\nhimself as though he were not a pauper.\r\n\r\nIn this way the afternoon went very pleasantly. For an hour before\r\ndinner Captain Bellfield was had into the drawing-room and was\r\ntalked to by his widow on matters of business; but he had of course\r\nknown that this was necessary. She scolded him soundly about those\r\nsheriff\'s officers. Why had he not told her? "As long as there\'s\r\nanything kept back, I won\'t have you," said she. "I won\'t become your\r\nwife till I\'m quite sure there\'s not a penny owing that is not shown\r\nin the list." Then I think he did tell her all,--or nearly all. When\r\nall was counted it was not so very much. Three or four hundred pounds\r\nwould make him a new man, and what was such a sum as that to his\r\nwealthy widow! Indeed, for a woman wanting a husband of that sort,\r\nCaptain Bellfield was a safer venture than would be a man of a higher\r\nstanding among his creditors. It is true Bellfield might have been\r\na forger, or a thief, or a returned convict,--but then his debts\r\ncould not be large. Let him have done his best, he could not have\r\nobtained credit for a thousand pounds; whereas, no one could tell the\r\nliabilities of a gentleman of high standing. Burgo Fitzgerald was a\r\ngentleman of high standing, and his creditors would have swallowed up\r\nevery shilling that Mrs. Greenow possessed; but with Captain Bellfield\r\nshe was comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole I think that she was lucky in her choice; or, perhaps,\r\nI might more truly say, that she had chosen with prudence. He was no\r\nforger, or thief--in the ordinary sense of the word; nor was he a\r\nreturned convict. He was simply an idle scamp, who had hung about the\r\nworld for forty years, doing nothing, without principle, shameless,\r\naccustomed to eat dirty puddings, and to be kicked--morally\r\nkicked--by such men as Cheesacre. But he was moderate in his\r\ngreediness, and possessed of a certain appreciation of the comfort\r\nof a daily dinner, which might possibly suffice to keep him from\r\nstraying very wide as long as his intended wife should be able to\r\nkeep the purse-strings altogether in her own hands. Therefore, I say\r\nthat Mrs. Greenow had been lucky in her choice, and not altogether\r\nwithout prudence.\r\n\r\n"I think of taking this house," said she, "and of living here."\r\n\r\n"What, in Westmoreland!" said the Captain, with something of dismay\r\nin his tone. What on earth would he do with himself all his life in\r\nthat gloomy place!\r\n\r\n"Yes, in Westmoreland. Why not in Westmoreland as well as anywhere\r\nelse? If you don\'t like Westmoreland, it\'s not too late yet, you\r\nknow." In answer to this the poor Captain was obliged to declare that\r\nhe had no objection whatever to Westmoreland.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been talking to my niece about it," continued Mrs. Greenow, "and\r\nI find that such an arrangement can be made very conveniently. The\r\nproperty is left between her and her uncle,--the father of my other\r\nniece, and neither of them want to live here."\r\n\r\n"But won\'t you be rather dull, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"We could go to Yarmouth, you know, in the autumn." Then the\r\nCaptain\'s visage became somewhat bright again. "And perhaps, if you\r\nare not extravagant, we could manage a month or so in London during\r\nthe winter, just to see the plays and do a little shopping." Then the\r\nCaptain\'s face became very bright. "That will be delightful," said\r\nhe. "And as for being dull," said the widow, "when people grow old\r\nthey must be dull. Dancing can\'t go on for ever." In answer to this\r\nthe widow\'s Captain assured the widow that she was not at all old;\r\nand now, on this occasion, that ceremony came off successfully which\r\nhad been interrupted on the Shap road by the noise of Mr. Cheesacre\'s\r\nwheels. "There goes my cap," said she. "What a goose you are! What\r\nwill Jeannette say?" "Bother Jeannette," said the Captain in his\r\nbliss. "She can do another cap, and many more won\'t be wanted." Then\r\nI think the ceremony was repeated.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole the Captain\'s visit was satisfactory--at any rate to\r\nthe Captain. Everything was settled. He was to go away on Saturday\r\nmorning, and remain in lodgings at Penrith till the wedding, which\r\nthey agreed to have celebrated at Vavasor Church. Kate promised to be\r\nthe solitary bridesmaid. There was some talk of sending for Charlie\r\nFairstairs, but the idea was abandoned. "We\'ll have her afterwards,"\r\nsaid the widow to Kate, "when you are gone, and we shall want her\r\nmore. And I\'ll get Cheesacre here, and make him marry her. There\'s\r\nno good in paying for two journeys." The Captain was to be allowed\r\nto come over from Penrith twice a week previous to his marriage; or\r\nperhaps, I might more fairly say, that he was commanded to do so. I\r\nwonder how he felt when Mrs. Greenow gave him his first five-pound\r\nnote, and told him that he must make it do for a fortnight?--whether\r\nit was all joy, or whether there was about his heart any touch of\r\nmanly regret?\r\n\r\n"Captain Bellfield, of Vavasor Hall, Westmoreland. It don\'t sound\r\nbadly," he said to himself, as he travelled away on his first journey\r\nto Penrith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nLady Monk\'s Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of Lady Monk\'s party, Burgo Fitzgerald disappeared; and\r\nwhen the guests were gone and the rooms were empty, his aunt inquired\r\nfor him in vain. The old butler and factotum of the house, who was\r\nemployed by Sir Cosmo to put out the lamps and to see that he was\r\nnot robbed beyond a certain point on these occasions of his wife\'s\r\ntriumphs, was interrogated by his mistress, and said that he thought\r\nMr. Burgo had left the house. Lady Monk herself knocked at her\r\nnephew\'s door, when she went up-stairs, ascending an additional\r\nflight of stairs with her weary old limbs in order that she might\r\ndo so; she even opened the door and saw the careless debris of his\r\ntoilet about the room. But he was gone. "Perhaps, after all, he has\r\narranged it," she said to herself, as she went down to her own room.\r\n\r\nBut Burgo, as we know, had not "arranged it." It may be remembered\r\nthat when Mr. Palliser came back to his wife in the supper-room at\r\nLady Monk\'s, bringing with him the scarf which Lady Glencora had left\r\nup-stairs, Burgo was no longer with her. He had become well aware\r\nthat he had no chance left, at any rate for that night. The poor\r\nfool, acting upon his aunt\'s implied advice rather than his own\r\nhopes, had secured a post-chaise, and stationed it in Bruton Street,\r\nsome five minutes\' walk from his aunt\'s house. And he had purchased\r\nfeminine wrappings, cloaks, &c.--things that he thought might be\r\nnecessary for his companion. He had, too, ordered rooms at the new\r\nhotel near the Dover Station,--the London Bridge Station,--from\r\nwhence was to start on the following morning a train to catch the\r\ntidal boat for Boulogne. There was a dressing-bag there for which he\r\nhad paid twenty-five guineas out of his aunt\'s money, not having been\r\nable to induce the tradesman to grant it to him on credit; and there\r\nwere other things,--slippers, collars, stockings, handkerchiefs, and\r\nwhat else might, as he thought, under such circumstances be most\r\nnecessary. Poor thoughtful, thoughtless fool!\r\n\r\nThe butler was right. He did leave the house. He saw Lady Glencora\r\ntaken to her carriage from some back hiding-place in the hall, and\r\nthen slipped out, unmindful of his shining boots, and dress coat and\r\njewelled studs. He took a Gibus hat,--his own, or that of some other\r\nunfortunate,--and slowly made his way down to the place in Bruton\r\nStreet. There was the carriage and pair of horses, all in readiness;\r\nand the driver, when he had placed himself by the door of the\r\nvehicle, was not long in emerging from the neighbouring public-house.\r\n"All ready, your honour," said the man. "I shan\'t want you to-night,"\r\nsaid Burgo, hoarsely;--"go away." "And about the things, your\r\nhonour?" "Take them to the devil. No; stop. Take them back with you,\r\nand ask somebody to keep them till I send for them. I shall want them\r\nand another carriage in a day or two." Then he gave the man half a\r\nsovereign, and went away, not looking at the little treasures which\r\nhe had spent so much of his money in selecting for his love. When he\r\nwas gone, the waterman and the driver turned them over with careful\r\nhands and gloating eyes. "It\'s a \'eiress, I\'ll go bail," said the\r\nwaterman. "Pretty dear! I suppose her parints was too many for her,"\r\nsaid the driver. But neither of them imagined the enormity which the\r\nhirer of the chaise had in truth contemplated.\r\n\r\nBurgo from thence took his way back into Grosvenor Square, and from\r\nthence down Park Street, and through a narrow passage and a mews\r\nwhich there are in those parts, into Park Lane. He had now passed\r\nthe position of Mr. Palliser\'s house, having come out on Park Lane\r\nat a spot nearer to Piccadilly; but he retraced his steps, walking\r\nalong by the rails of the Park, till he found himself opposite to\r\nthe house. Then he stood there, leaning back upon the railings, and\r\nlooking up at Lady Glencora\'s windows. What did he expect to see?\r\nOr was he, in truth, moved by love of that kind which can take joy\r\nin watching the slightest shadow that is made by the one loved\r\nobject,--that may be made by her, or, by some violent conjecture of\r\nthe mind, may be supposed to have been so made? Such love as that is,\r\nI think, always innocent. Burgo Fitzgerald did not love like that. I\r\nalmost doubt whether he can be said to have loved at all. There was\r\nin his breast a mixed, feverish desire, which he took no trouble to\r\nanalyse. He wanted money. He wanted the thing of which this Palliser\r\nhad robbed him. He wanted revenge,--though his desire for that was\r\nnot a burning desire. And among other things, he wanted the woman\'s\r\nbeauty of the woman whom he coveted. He wanted to kiss her again as\r\nhe had once kissed her, and to feel that she was soft, and lovely,\r\nand loving for him. But as for seeing her shadow, unless its movement\r\nindicated some purpose in his favour,--I do not think that he cared\r\nmuch about that.\r\n\r\nAnd why then was he there? Because in his unreasoning folly he did\r\nnot know what step to take, or what step not to take. There are men\r\nwhose energies hardly ever carry them beyond looking for the thing\r\nthey want. She might see him from the window, and come to him. I do\r\nnot say that he thought that it would be so. I fancy that he never\r\nthought at all about that or about anything. If you lie under a tree,\r\nand open your mouth, a plum may fall into it. It was probably an\r\nundefined idea of some such chance as this which brought him against\r\nthe railings in the front of Mr. Palliser\'s house; that, and a feeling\r\nmade up partly of despair and partly of lingering romance that he\r\nwas better there, out in the night air, under the gas-lamps, than\r\nhe could be elsewhere. There he stood and looked, and cursed his\r\nill-luck. But his curses had none of the bitterness of those which\r\nGeorge Vavasor was always uttering. Through it all there remained\r\nabout Burgo one honest feeling,--one conviction that was true,--a\r\nfeeling that it all served him right, and that he had better,\r\nperhaps, go to the devil at once, and give nobody any more trouble.\r\nIf he loved no one sincerely, neither did he hate any one; and\r\nwhenever he made any self-inquiry into his own circumstances, he\r\nalways told himself that it was all his own fault. When he cursed\r\nhis fate, he only did so because cursing is so easy. George Vavasor\r\nwould have ground his victims up to powder if he knew how; but Burgo\r\nFitzgerald desired to hurt no one.\r\n\r\nThere he stood till he was cold, and then, as the plum did not drop\r\ninto his mouth, he moved on. He went up into Oxford Street, and\r\nwalked along it the whole distance to the corner of Bond Street,\r\npassing by Grosvenor Square, to which he intended to return. At the\r\ncorner of Bond Street, a girl took hold of him, and looked up into\r\nhis face. "Ah!" she said, "I saw you once before."--"Then you saw the\r\nmost miserable devil alive," said Burgo. "You can\'t be miserable,"\r\nsaid the girl. "What makes you miserable? You\'ve plenty of\r\nmoney."--"I wish I had," said Burgo. "And plenty to eat and drink,"\r\nexclaimed the girl; "and you are so handsome! I remember you. You\r\ngave me supper one night when I was starving. I ain\'t hungry now.\r\nWill you give me a kiss?"--"I\'ll give you a shilling, and that\'s\r\nbetter," said Burgo. "But give me a kiss too," said the girl. He gave\r\nher first the kiss, and then the shilling, and after that he left her\r\nand passed on. "I\'m d----d if I wouldn\'t change with her!" he said\r\nto himself. "I wonder whether anything really ails him?" thought the\r\ngirl. "He said he was wretched before. Shouldn\'t I like to be good to\r\nsuch a one as him!"\r\n\r\nBurgo went on, and made his way into the house in Grosvenor Square,\r\nby some means probably unknown to his aunt, and certainly unknown to\r\nhis uncle. He emptied his pockets as he got into bed, and counted a\r\nroll of notes which he had kept in one of them. There were still a\r\nhundred and thirty pounds left. Lady Glencora had promised that she\r\nwould see him again. She had said as much as that quite distinctly.\r\nBut what use would there be in that if all his money should then be\r\ngone? He knew that the keeping of money in his pocket was to him\r\nquite an impossibility. Then he thought of his aunt. What should he\r\nsay to his aunt if he saw her in the course of the coming day? Might\r\nit not be as well for him to avoid his aunt altogether?\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted up-stairs in his bedroom,--in the bed, indeed, eating\r\na small pate de foie gras from the supper-table, as he read a French\r\nnovel. There he was still reading his French novel in bed when his\r\naunt\'s maid came to him, saying that his aunt wished to see him\r\nbefore she went out. "Tell me, Lucy," said he, "how is the old girl?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s as cross as cross, Mr. Burgo. Indeed, I shan\'t;--not a minute\r\nlonger. Don\'t, now; will you? I tell you she\'s waiting for me." From\r\nwhich it may be seen that Lucy shared the general feminine feeling in\r\nfavour of poor Burgo.\r\n\r\nThus summoned Burgo applied himself to his toilet; but as he did so,\r\nhe recruited his energies from time to time by a few pages of the\r\nFrench novel, and also by small doses from a bottle of curacoa which\r\nhe had in his bedroom. He was utterly a pauper. There was no pauper\r\npoorer than he in London that day. But, nevertheless, he breakfasted\r\non pate de foie gras and curacoa, and regarded those dainties very\r\nmuch as other men regard bread and cheese and beer.\r\n\r\nBut though he was dressing at the summons of his aunt, he had by no\r\nmeans made up his mind that he would go to her. Why should he go to\r\nher? What good would it do him? She would not give him more money.\r\nShe would only scold him for his misconduct. She might, perhaps, turn\r\nhim out of the house if he did not obey her,--or attempt to do so;\r\nbut she would be much more likely to do this when he had made her\r\nangry by contradicting her. In neither case would he leave the house,\r\neven though its further use were positively forbidden him, because\r\nhis remaining there was convenient; but as he could gain nothing by\r\nseeing "the old girl," as he had called her, he resolved to escape to\r\nhis club without attending to her summons.\r\n\r\nBut his aunt, who was a better general than he, out-manoeuvred\r\nhim. He crept down the back stairs; but as he could not quite\r\ncondescend to escape through the area, he was forced to emerge upon\r\nthe hall, and here his aunt pounced upon him, coming out of the\r\nbreakfast-parlour. "Did not Lucy tell you that I wanted to see you?"\r\nLady Monk asked, with severity in her voice.\r\n\r\nBurgo replied, with perfect ease, that he was going out just to\r\nhave his hair washed and brushed. He would have been back in twenty\r\nminutes. There was no energy about the poor fellow, unless, perhaps,\r\nwhen he was hunting; but he possessed a readiness which enabled him\r\nto lie at a moment\'s notice with the most perfect ease. Lady Monk did\r\nnot believe him; but she could not confute him, and therefore she let\r\nthe lie pass.\r\n\r\n"Never mind your hair now," she said. "I want to speak to you. Come\r\nin here for a few minutes."\r\n\r\nAs there was no way of escape left to him, he followed his aunt into\r\nthe breakfast-parlour.\r\n\r\n"Burgo," she said, when she had seated herself, and had made him\r\nsit in a chair opposite to her, "I don\'t think you will ever do any\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t much think I shall, aunt."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, then, to do with yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh,--I don\'t know. I haven\'t thought much about it."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stay here in this house. Sir Cosmo was speaking to me\r\nabout you only yesterday morning."\r\n\r\n"I shall be quite willing to go down to Monkshade, if Sir Cosmo likes\r\nit better;--that is, when the season is a little more through."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t have you at Monkshade. He won\'t let you go there again. And\r\nhe won\'t have you here. You know that you are turning what I say into\r\njoke."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, aunt,"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are;--you know you are. You are the most ungrateful,\r\nheartless creature I ever met. You must make up your mind to leave\r\nthis house at once."\r\n\r\n"Where does Sir Cosmo mean that I should go, then?"\r\n\r\n"To the workhouse, if you like. He doesn\'t care."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he does;--the least in the world," said Burgo,\r\nopening his eyes, and stretching his nostrils, and looking into his\r\naunt\'s face as though he had great ground for indignation.\r\n\r\nBut the turning of Burgo out of the house was not Lady Monk\'s\r\nimmediate purpose. She knew that he would hang on there till the\r\nseason was over. After that he must not be allowed to return again,\r\nunless he should have succeeded in a certain enterprise. She had\r\nnow caught him in order that she might learn whether there was any\r\npossible remaining chance of success as to that enterprise. So she\r\nreceived his indignation in silence, and began upon another subject.\r\n"What a fool you made of yourself last night, Burgo!"\r\n\r\n"Did I;--more of a fool than usual?"\r\n\r\n"I believe that you will never be serious about anything. Why did you\r\ngo on waltzing in that way when every pair of eyes in the room was\r\nwatching you?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help going on, if she liked it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes,--say it was her fault. That\'s so like a man!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, aunt, I\'m not going to sit here and be abused. I couldn\'t\r\ntake her in my arms, and fly away with her out of a crowd."\r\n\r\n"Who wants you to fly away with her?"\r\n\r\n"For the matter of that, I suppose that you do."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I do."\r\n\r\n"You! you haven\'t spirit to do that, or anything else. You are like a\r\nchild that is just able to amuse itself for the moment, and never can\r\nthink of anything further. You simply disgraced yourself last night,\r\nand me too,--and her; but, of course, you care nothing about that."\r\n\r\n"I had a plan all ready;--only he came back."\r\n\r\n"Of course he came back. Of course he came back, when they sent him\r\nword how you and she were going on. And now he will have forgiven\r\nher, and after that, of course, the thing will be all over."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, aunt; she would go if she knew how. When I was\r\nforced to leave her last night, she promised to see me again. And as\r\nfor being idle, and not doing anything;--why, I was out in Park Lane\r\nlast night, after you were in bed."\r\n\r\n"What good did that do?"\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t do any good, as it happened. But a fellow can only\r\ntry. I believe, after all, it would be easier down in the\r\ncountry,--especially now that he has taken it into his head to look\r\nafter her."\r\n\r\nLady Monk sat silent for a few moments, and then she said in a low\r\nvoice, "What did she say to you when you were parting? What were her\r\nexact words?" She, at any rate, was not deficient in energy. She\r\nwas anxious enough to see her purpose accomplished. She would have\r\nconducted the matter with discretion, if the running away with Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s wife could, in very fact, have been done by herself.\r\n\r\n"She said she would see me again. She promised it twice."\r\n\r\n"And was that all?"\r\n\r\n"What could she say more, when she was forced to go away?"\r\n\r\n"Had she said that she would go with you?"\r\n\r\n"I had asked her,--half a dozen times, and she did not once refuse.\r\nI know she means it, if she knew how to get away. She hates him;--I\'m\r\nsure of it. A woman, you know, wouldn\'t absolutely say that she would\r\ngo, till she was gone."\r\n\r\n"If she really meant it, she would tell you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she could have told me plainer. She said she would see\r\nme again. She said that twice over."\r\n\r\nAgain Lady Monk sat silent. She had a plan in her head,--a plan that\r\nmight, as she thought, give to her nephew one more chance. But she\r\nhesitated before she could bring herself to explain it in detail.\r\nAt first she had lent a little aid to this desired abduction of Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s wife, but in lending it had said no word upon the subject.\r\nDuring the last season she had succeeded in getting Lady Glencora\r\nto her house in London, and had taken care that Burgo should meet\r\nher there. Then a hint or two had been spoken, and Lady Glencora\r\nhad been asked to Monkshade. Lady Glencora, as we know, did not go\r\nto Monkshade, and Lady Monk had then been baffled. But she did not\r\ntherefore give up the game. Having now thought of it so much, she\r\nbegan to speak of it more boldly, and had procured money for her\r\nnephew that he might thereby be enabled to carry off the woman. But\r\nthough this had been well understood between them, though words had\r\nbeen spoken which were sufficiently explicit, the plan had not been\r\nopenly discussed. Lady Monk had known nothing of the mode in which\r\nLady Glencora was to have been carried off after her party, nor\r\nwhither she was to have been taken. But now,--now she must arrange it\r\nherself, and have a scheme of her own, or else the thing must fail\r\nabsolutely. Even she was almost reluctant to speak out plainly to her\r\nnephew on such a subject. What if he should be false to her, and tell\r\nof her? But when a woman has made such schemes, nothing distresses\r\nher so sadly as their failure. She would risk all rather than that Mr.\r\nPalliser should keep his wife.\r\n\r\n"I will try and help you," she said at last, speaking hoarsely,\r\nalmost in a whisper, "if you have courage to make an attempt\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Courage!" said he "What is it you think I am afraid of? Mr. Palliser?\r\nI\'d fight him,--or all the Pallisers, one after another, if it would\r\ndo any good."\r\n\r\n"Fighting! There\'s no fighting wanted, as you know well enough. Men\r\ndon\'t fight nowadays. Look here! If you can get her to call here some\r\nday,--say on Thursday, at three o\'clock,--I will be here to receive\r\nher; and instead of going back into her carriage, you can have a cab\r\nfor her somewhere near. She can come, as it were, to make a morning\r\ncall."\r\n\r\n"A cab!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; a cab won\'t kill her, and it is less easily followed than a\r\ncarriage."\r\n\r\n"And where shall we go?"\r\n\r\n"There is a train to Southampton at four, and the boat sails for\r\nJersey at half-past six; you will be in Jersey the next morning,\r\nand there is a boat goes on to St. Malo, almost at once. You can go\r\ndirect from one boat to the other,--that is, if she has strength and\r\ncourage." After that, who will say that Lady Monk was not a devoted\r\naunt?\r\n\r\n"That would do excellently well," said the enraptured Burgo.\r\n\r\n"She will have difficulty in getting away from me, out of the house.\r\nOf course I shall say nothing about it, and shall know nothing about\r\nit. She had better tell her coachman to drive somewhere to pick\r\nsome one up, and to return;--out somewhere to Tyburnia, or down to\r\nPimlico. Then she can leave me, and go out on foot, to where you\r\nhave the cab. She can tell the hall-porter that she will walk to her\r\ncarriage. Do you understand?" Burgo declared that he did understand.\r\n\r\n"You must call on her, and make your way in, and see her, and arrange\r\nall this. It must be a Thursday, because of the boats." Then she\r\nmade inquiry about his money, and took from him the notes which he\r\nhad, promising to return them, with something added, on the Thursday\r\nmorning; but he asked, with a little whine, for a five-pound note,\r\nand got it. Burgo then told her about the travelling-bags and the\r\nstockings, and they were quite pleasant and confidential. "Bid her\r\ncome in a stout travelling-dress," said Lady Monk. "She can wear some\r\nlace or something over it, so that the servants won\'t observe it. I\r\nwill take no notice of it." Was there ever such an aunt?\r\n\r\nAfter this, Burgo left his aunt, and went away to his club, in a\r\nstate of most happy excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Last Kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice, on her return from Westmoreland, went direct to Park Lane,\r\nwhither Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser had also returned before\r\nher. She was to remain with them in London one entire day, and on\r\nthe morning after that they were to start for Paris. She found\r\nMr. Palliser in close attendance upon his wife. Not that there was\r\nanything in his manner which at all implied that he was keeping watch\r\nover her, or that he was more with her, or closer to her than a\r\nloving husband might wish to be with a young wife; but the mode of\r\nlife was very different from that which Alice had seen at Matching\r\nPriory!\r\n\r\nOn her arrival Mr. Palliser himself received her in the hall, and took\r\nher up to his wife before she had taken off her travelling hat. "We\r\nare so much obliged to you, Miss Vavasor," he said. "I feel it quite\r\nas deeply as Glencora."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she said; "it is I that am under obligation to you for\r\ntaking me."\r\n\r\nHe merely smiled, and shook his head, and then took her up-stairs.\r\nOn the stairs he said one other word to her: "You must forgive me if\r\nI was cross to you that night she went out among the ruins." Alice\r\nmuttered something,--some little fib of courtesy as to the matter\r\nhaving been forgotten, or never borne in mind; and then they went on\r\nto Lady Glencora\'s room. It seemed to Alice that he was not so big\r\nor so much to be dreaded as when she had seen him at Matching. His\r\ndescent from an expectant, or more than an expectant, Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, down to a simple, attentive husband, seemed to affect\r\nhis gait, his voice, and all his demeanour. When he received Alice at\r\nthe Priory he certainly loomed before her as something great, whereas\r\nnow his greatness seemed to have fallen from him. We must own that\r\nthis was hard upon him, seeing that the deed by which he had divested\r\nhimself of his greatness had been so pure and good!\r\n\r\n"Dear Alice, this is so good of you! I am all in the midst of\r\npacking, and Plantagenet is helping me." Plantagenet winced a little\r\nunder this, as the hero of old must have winced when he was found\r\nwith the distaff. Mr. Palliser had relinquished his sword of state\r\nfor the distaff which he had assumed, and could take no glory in the\r\nchange. There was, too, in his wife\'s voice the slightest hint of\r\nmockery, which, slight as it was, he perhaps thought she might have\r\nspared. "You have nothing left to pack," continued Glencora, "and I\r\ndon\'t know what you can do to amuse yourself."\r\n\r\n"I will help you," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But we have so very nearly done. I think we shall have to pull all\r\nthe things out, and put them up again, or we shall never get through\r\nto-morrow. We couldn\'t start to-morrow;--could we, Plantagenet?"\r\n\r\n"Not very well, as your rooms are ordered in Paris for the next day."\r\n\r\n"As if we couldn\'t find rooms at every inn on the road. Men are\r\nso particular. Now in travelling I should like never to order\r\nrooms,--never to know where I was going or when I was going, and to\r\ncarry everything I wanted in a market-basket." Alice, who by this\r\ntime had followed her friend along the passage to her bedroom, and\r\nhad seen how widely the packages were spread about, bethought herself\r\nthat the market-basket should be a large one. "And I would never\r\ntravel among Christians. Christians are so slow, and they wear\r\nchimney-pot hats everywhere. The further one goes from London among\r\nChristians, the more they wear chimney-pot hats. I want Plantagenet\r\nto take us to see the Kurds, but he won\'t."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that would be fair to Miss Vavasor," said Mr. Palliser,\r\nwho had followed them.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t put the blame on her head," said Lady Glencora. "Women have\r\nalways pluck for anything. Wouldn\'t you like to see a live Kurd,\r\nAlice?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t exactly know where they live," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Nor I. I have not the remotest idea of the way to the Kurds. You see\r\nmy joke, don\'t you, though Plantagenet doesn\'t? But one knows that\r\nthey are Eastern, and the East is such a grand idea!"\r\n\r\n"I think we\'ll content ourselves with Rome, or perhaps Naples, on\r\nthis occasion," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nThe notion of Lady Glencora packing anything for herself was as good\r\na joke as that other one of the Kurds and whey. But she went flitting\r\nabout from room to room, declaring that this thing must be taken,\r\nand that other, till the market-basket would have become very large\r\nindeed. Alice was astonished at the extent of the preparations, and\r\nthe sort of equipage with which they were about to travel. Lady\r\nGlencora was taking her own carriage. "Not that I shall ever use it,"\r\nshe said to Alice, "but he insists upon it, to show that I am not\r\nsupposed to be taken away in disgrace. He is so good;--isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Alice. "I know no one better."\r\n\r\n"And so dull!" said Lady Glencora. "But I fancy that all husbands are\r\ndull from the nature of their position. If I were a young woman\'s\r\nhusband, I shouldn\'t know what to say to her that wasn\'t dull."\r\n\r\nTwo women and two men servants were to be taken. Alice had received\r\npermission to bring her own maid--"or a dozen, if you want them,"\r\nLady Glencora had said. "Mr. Palliser in his present mood would think\r\nnothing too much to do for you. If you were to ask him to go among\r\nthe Kurds, he\'d go at once;--or on to Crim Tartary, if you made a\r\npoint of it." But as both Lady Glencora\'s servants spoke French, and\r\nas her own did not, Alice trusted herself in that respect to her\r\ncousin. "You shall have one all to yourself," said Lady Glencora. "I\r\nonly take two for the same reason that I take the carriage,--just as\r\nyou let a child go out in her best frock, for a treat, after you\'ve\r\nscolded her."\r\n\r\nWhen Alice asked why it was supposed that Mr. Palliser was so\r\nspecially devoted to her, the thing was explained to her. "You see,\r\nmy dear, I have told him everything. I always do tell everything.\r\nNobody can say I am not candid. He knows about your not letting me\r\ncome to your house in the old days. Oh, Alice!--you were wrong then;\r\nI shall always say that. But it\'s done and gone; and things that are\r\ndone and gone shall be done and gone for me. And I told him all that\r\nyou said,--about you know what. I have had nothing else to do but\r\nmake confessions for the last ten days, and when a woman once begins,\r\nthe more she confesses the better. And I told him that you refused\r\nJeffrey."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"I did indeed, and he likes you the better for that. I think he\'d\r\nlet Jeffrey marry you now if you both wished it;--and then, oh\r\ndear!--supposing that you had a son and that we adopted it?"\r\n\r\n"Cora, if you go on in that way I will not remain with you."\r\n\r\n"But you must, my dear. You can\'t escape now. At any rate, you can\'t\r\nwhen we once get to Paris. Oh dear! you shouldn\'t grudge me my little\r\nnaughtinesses. I have been so proper for the last ten days. Do you\r\nknow I got into a way of driving Dandy and Flirt at the rate of six\r\nmiles an hour, till I\'m sure the poor beasts thought they were always\r\ngoing to a funeral. Poor Dandy and poor Flirt! I shan\'t see them now\r\nfor another year."\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they breakfasted early, because Mr. Palliser\r\nhad got into an early habit. He had said that early hours would be\r\ngood for them. "But he never tells me why," said Lady Glencora.\r\n"I think it is pleasant when people are travelling," said Alice.\r\n"It isn\'t that," her cousin answered; "but we are all to be such\r\nparticularly good children. It\'s hardly fair, because he went to\r\nsleep last night after dinner while you and I kept ourselves awake:\r\nbut we needn\'t do that another night, to be sure." After breakfast\r\nthey all three went to work to do nothing. It was ludicrous and\r\nalmost painful to see Mr. Palliser wandering about and counting the\r\nboxes, as though he could do any good by that. At this special crisis\r\nof his life he hated his papers and figures and statistics, and\r\ncould not apply himself to them. He, whose application had been\r\nso unremitting, could apply himself now to nothing. His world had\r\nbeen brought to an abrupt end, and he was awkward at making a new\r\nbeginning. I believe that they all three were reading novels before\r\none o\'clock. Lady Glencora and Alice had determined that they would\r\nnot leave the house throughout the day. "Nothing has been said about\r\nit, but I regard it as part of the bond that I\'m not to go out\r\nanywhere. Who knows but what I might be found in Gloucester Square?"\r\nThere was, however, no absolute necessity that Mr. Palliser should\r\nremain with them; and, at about three, he prepared himself for a\r\nsolitary walk. He would not go down to the House. All interest in the\r\nHouse was over with him for the present. He had the Speaker\'s leave\r\nto absent himself for the season. Nor would he call on anyone. All\r\nhis friends knew, or believed they knew, that he had left town. His\r\ndeath and burial had been already chronicled, and were he now to\r\nreappear, he could reappear only as a ghost. He was being talked\r\nof as the departed one;--or rather, such talk on all sides had now\r\ncome nearly to an end. The poor Duke of St. Bungay still thought of\r\nhim with regret when more than ordinarily annoyed by some special\r\ngrievance coming to him from Mr. Finespun; but even the Duke had\r\nbecome almost reconciled to the present order of things. Mr. Palliser\r\nknew better than to disturb all this by showing himself again in\r\npublic; and prepared himself, therefore, to take another walk under\r\nthe elms in Kensington Gardens.\r\n\r\nHe had his hat on his head in the hall, and was in the act of putting\r\non his gloves, when there came a knock at the front door. The\r\nhall-porter was there, a stout, plethoric personage, not given\r\nto many words, who was at this moment standing with his master\'s\r\numbrella in his hand, looking as though he would fain be of some use\r\nto somebody, if any such utility were compatible with the purposes\r\nof his existence. Now had come this knock at the door, while the\r\numbrella was still in his hand, and the nature of his visage changed,\r\nand it was easy to see that he was oppressed by the temporary\r\nmultiplicity of his duties. "Give me the umbrella, John," said Mr.\r\nPalliser. John gave up the umbrella, and opening the door disclosed\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald standing upon the door-step. "Is Lady Glencora at\r\nhome?" asked Burgo, before he had seen the husband. John turned a\r\ndismayed face upon his master, as though he knew that the comer ought\r\nnot to be making a morning call at that house,--as no doubt he did\r\nknow very well,--and made no instant reply. "I am not sure," said\r\nMr. Palliser, making his way out as he had originally purposed. "The\r\nservant will find out for you." Then he went on his way across Park\r\nLane and into the Park, never once turning back his face to see\r\nwhether Burgo had effected an entrance into the house. Nor did he\r\nreturn a minute earlier than he would otherwise have done. After all,\r\nthere was something chivalrous about the man.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Lady Glencora was at home," said the porter, not stirring to\r\nmake any further inquiry. It was no business of his if Mr. Palliser\r\nchose to receive such a guest. He had not been desired to say that\r\nher ladyship was not at home. Burgo was therefore admitted and shown\r\ndirect up into the room in which Lady Glencora was sitting. As chance\r\nwould have it, she was alone. Alice had left her and was in her\r\nown chamber, and Lady Glencora was sitting at the window of the\r\nsmall room up-stairs that overlooked the Park. She was seated on a\r\nfootstool with her face between her hands when Burgo was admitted,\r\nthinking of him, and of what the world might have been to her had\r\n"they left her alone," as she was in the habit of saying to Alice and\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nShe rose quickly, so that he saw her only as she was rising. "Ask\r\nMiss Vavasor to come to me," she said, as the servant left the room;\r\nand then she came forward to greet her lover.\r\n\r\n"Cora," he said, dashing at once into his subject--hopelessly, but\r\nstill with a resolve to do as he had said that he would do. "Cora,\r\nI have come to you, to ask you to go with me."\r\n\r\n"I will not go with you," said she.\r\n\r\n"Do not answer me in that way, without a moment\'s thought. Everything\r\nis arranged--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, everything is arranged," she said. "Mr. Fitzgerald, let me\r\nask you to leave me alone, and to behave to me with generosity.\r\nEverything is arranged. You can see that my boxes are all prepared\r\nfor going. Mr. Palliser and I, and my friend, are starting to-morrow.\r\nWish me God-speed and go, and be generous."\r\n\r\n"And is this to be the end of everything?" He was standing close to\r\nher, but hitherto he had only touched her hand at greeting her. "Give\r\nme your hand, Cora," he said.\r\n\r\n"No;--I will never give you my hand again. You should be generous to\r\nme and go. This is to be the end of everything,--of everything that\r\nis common to you and to me. Go, when I ask you."\r\n\r\n"Cora; did you ever love me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did love you. But we were separated, and there was no room\r\nfor love left between us."\r\n\r\n"You are as dear to me now,--dearer than ever you were. Do not look\r\nat me like that. Did you not tell me when we last parted that I might\r\ncome to you again? Are we children, that others should come between\r\nus and separate us like that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Burgo; we are children. Here is my cousin coming. You must\r\nleave me now." As she spoke the door was opened and Alice entered the\r\nroom. "Miss Vavasor, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Lady Glencora. "I have\r\ntold him to go and leave me. Now that you have come, Alice, he will\r\nperhaps obey me."\r\n\r\nAlice was dumbfounded, and knew not how to speak either to him or to\r\nher; but she stood with her eyes riveted on the face of the man of\r\nwhom she had heard so much. Yes; certainly he was very beautiful. She\r\nhad never before seen man\'s beauty such as that. She found it quite\r\nimpossible to speak a word to him then--at the spur of the moment,\r\nbut she acknowledged the introduction with a slight inclination of\r\nthe head, and then stood silent, as though she were waiting for him\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald, why do you not leave me and go?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nPoor Burgo also found it difficult enough to speak. What could he\r\nsay? His cause was one which certainly did not admit of being pleaded\r\nin the presence of a strange lady; and he might have known from the\r\nmoment in which he heard Glencora\'s request that a third person\r\nshould be summoned to their meeting--and probably did know, that\r\nthere was no longer any hope for him. It was not on the cards that he\r\nshould win. But there remained one thing that he must do. He must get\r\nhimself out of that room; and how was he to effect that?\r\n\r\n"I had hoped," said he, looking at Alice, though he addressed Lady\r\nGlencora--"I had hoped to be allowed to speak to you alone for a few\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Fitzgerald; it cannot be so. Alice do not go. I sent for my\r\ncousin when I saw you, because I did not choose to be alone with you.\r\nI have asked you to go--"\r\n\r\n"You perhaps have not understood me?"\r\n\r\n"I understand you well enough."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Alice, "why do you not do as Lady\r\nGlencora has asked you? You know--you must know, that you ought not\r\nto be here."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of the kind," said he, still standing his ground.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said Lady Glencora, "we will leave Mr. Fitzgerald here, since\r\nhe drives us from the room."\r\n\r\nIn such contests, a woman has ever the best of it at all points. The\r\nman plays with a button to his foil, while the woman uses a weapon\r\nthat can really wound. Burgo knew that he must go,--felt that he\r\nmust skulk away as best he might, and perhaps hear a low titter of\r\nhalf-suppressed laughter as he went. Even that might be possible.\r\n"No, Lady Glencora," he said, "I will not drive you from the room.\r\nAs one must be driven out, it shall be I. I own I did think that you\r\nwould at any rate have been--less hard to me." He then turned to go,\r\nbowing again very slightly to Miss Vavasor.\r\n\r\nHe was on the threshold of the door before Glencora\'s voice recalled\r\nhim. "Oh my God!" she said, "I am hard,--harder than flint. I am\r\ncruel. Burgo!" And he was back with her in a moment, and had taken\r\nher by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Glencora," said Alice, "pray,--pray let him go. Mr. Fitzgerald, if\r\nyou are a man, do not take advantage of her folly."\r\n\r\n"I will speak to him," said Lady Glencora. "I will speak to him,\r\nand then he shall leave me." She was holding him by the hand now\r\nand turning to him, away from Alice, who had taken her by the arm.\r\n"Burgo," she said, repeating his name twice again, with all the\r\npassion that she could throw into the word,--"Burgo, no good can come\r\nof this. Now, you must leave me. You must go. I shall stay with my\r\nhusband as I am bound to do. Because I have wronged you, I will not\r\nwrong him also. I loved you;--you know I loved you." She still held\r\nhim by the hand, and was now gazing up into his face, while the tears\r\nwere streaming from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Alice, "you have heard from her all that you can care to\r\nhear. If you have any feeling of honour in you, you will leave her."\r\n\r\n"I will never leave her, while she tells me that she loves me!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Burgo, you will;--you must! I shall never tell you that again,\r\nnever. Do as she bids you. Go, and leave us;--but I could not bear\r\nthat you should tell me that I was hard."\r\n\r\n"You are hard;--hard and cruel, as you said, yourself."\r\n\r\n"Am I? May God forgive you for saying that of me!"\r\n\r\n"Then why do you send me away?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am a man\'s wife, and because I care for his honour, if not\r\nfor my own. Alice, let us go."\r\n\r\nHe still held her, but she would have been gone from him had he not\r\nstooped over her, and put his arm round her waist. In doing this, I\r\ndoubt whether he was quicker than she would have been had she chosen\r\nto resist him. As it was, he pressed her to his bosom, and, stooping\r\nover her, kissed her lips. Then he left her, and making his way out\r\nof the room, and down the stairs, got himself out into the street.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, that he is gone!" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"You may say so," said Lady Glencora, "for you have lost nothing!"\r\n\r\n"And you have gained everything!"\r\n\r\n"Have I? I did not know that I had ever gained anything, as yet. The\r\nonly human being to whom I have ever yet given my whole heart,--the\r\nonly thing that I have ever really loved, has just gone from me for\r\never, and you bid me thank God that I have lost him. There is no room\r\nfor thankfulness in any of it;--either in the love or in the loss. It\r\nis all wretchedness from first to last!"\r\n\r\n"At any rate, he understands now that you meant it when you told him\r\nto leave you."\r\n\r\n"Of course I meant it. I am beginning to know myself by degrees. As\r\nfor running away with him, I have not the courage to do it. I can\r\nthink of it, scheme for it, wish for it;--but as for doing it, that\r\nis beyond me. Mr. Palliser is quite safe. He need not try to coax me\r\nto remain."\r\n\r\nAlice knew that it was useless to argue with her, so she came and sat\r\nover her,--for Lady Glencora had again placed herself on the stool\r\nby the window,--and tried to sooth her by smoothing her hair, and\r\nnursing her like a child.\r\n\r\n"Of course I know that I ought to stay where I am," she said,\r\nbreaking out, almost with rage, and speaking with quick, eager voice.\r\n"I am not such a fool as to mistake what I should be if I left my\r\nhusband, and went to live with that man as his mistress. You don\'t\r\nsuppose that I should think that sort of life very blessed. But\r\nwhy have I been brought to such a pass as this? And, as for female\r\npurity! Ah! What was their idea of purity when they forced me, like\r\nogres, to marry a man for whom they knew I never cared? Had I gone\r\nwith him,--had I now eloped with that man who ought to have been my\r\nhusband,--whom would a just God have punished worst,--me, or those\r\ntwo old women and my uncle, who tortured me into this marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Come, Cora,--be silent."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be silent! You have had the making of your own lot. You have\r\ndone what you liked, and no one has interfered with you. You have\r\nsuffered, too; but you, at any rate, can respect yourself."\r\n\r\n"And so can you, Cora,--thoroughly, now."\r\n\r\n"How;--when he kissed me, and I could hardly restrain myself from\r\ngiving him back his kiss tenfold, could I respect myself? But it is\r\nall sin. I sin towards my husband, feigning that I love him; and\r\nI sin in loving that other man, who should have been my husband.\r\nThere;--I hear Mr. Palliser at the door. Come away with me; or rather,\r\nstay, for he will come up here, and you can keep him in talk while I\r\ntry to recover myself."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser did at once as his wife had said, and came up-stairs\r\nto the little front room, as soon as he had deposited his hat in\r\nthe hall. Alice was, in fact, in doubt what she should do, as to\r\nmentioning, or omitting to mention, Mr. Fitzgerald\'s name. In an\r\nordinary way, it would be natural that she should name any visitor\r\nwho had called, and she specially disliked the idea of remaining\r\nsilent because that visitor had come as the lover of her host\'s wife.\r\nBut, on the other hand, she owed much to Lady Glencora; and there\r\nwas no imperative reason, as things had gone, why she should make\r\nmischief. There was no further danger to be apprehended. But Mr.\r\nPalliser at once put an end to her doubts. "You have had a visitor\r\nhere?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"I saw him as I went out," said Mr. Palliser. "Indeed, I met him\r\nat the hall door. He, of course, was wrong to come here;--so wrong,\r\nthat he deserves punishment, if there were any punishment for such\r\noffences."\r\n\r\n"He has been punished, I think," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"But as for Glencora," continued Mr. Palliser, without any apparent\r\nnotice of what Alice had said, "I thought it better that she should\r\nsee him or not, as she should herself decide."\r\n\r\n"She had no choice in the matter. As it turned out, he was shown up\r\nhere at once. She sent for me, and I think she was right to do that."\r\n\r\n"Glencora was alone when he came in?"\r\n\r\n"For a minute or two,--till I could get to her."\r\n\r\n"I have no questions to ask about it," said Mr. Palliser, after\r\nwaiting for a few moments. He had probably thought that Alice would\r\nsay something further. "I am very glad that you were within reach of\r\nher, as otherwise her position might have been painful. For her, and\r\nfor me perhaps, it may be as well that he has been here. As for him,\r\nI can only say, that I am forced to suppose him to be a villain. What\r\na man does when driven by passion, I can forgive; but that he should\r\ndeliberately plan schemes to ruin both her and me, is what I can\r\nhardly understand." As he made this little speech I wonder whether\r\nhis conscience said anything to him about Lady Dumbello, and a\r\ncertain evening in his own life, on which he had ventured to call\r\nthat lady, Griselda.\r\n\r\nThe little party of three dined together very quietly, and after\r\ndinner they all went to work with their novels. Before long Alice saw\r\nthat Mr. Palliser was yawning, and she began to understand how much\r\nhe had given up in order that his wife might be secure. It was then,\r\nwhen he had left the room for a few minutes, in order that he might\r\nwake himself by walking about the house, that Glencora told Alice of\r\nhis yawning down at Matching. "I used to think that he would fall in\r\npieces. What are we to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t seem to notice it," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said the other; "but he\'ll set us off yawning\r\nas bad as himself, and then he\'ll notice it. He has given himself up\r\nto politics, till nothing else has any salt in it left for him. I\r\ncannot think why such a man as that wanted a wife at all."\r\n\r\n"You are very hard upon him, Cora."\r\n\r\n"I wish you were his wife, with all my heart. But, of course, I know\r\nwhy he got married. And I ought to feel for him as he has been so\r\ngrievously disappointed." Then Mr. Palliser having walked off his\r\nsleep, returned to the room, and the remainder of the evening was\r\npassed in absolute tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald, when he left the house, turned back into Grosvenor\r\nSquare, not knowing, at first, whither he was going. He took himself\r\nas far as his uncle\'s door, and then, having paused there for a\r\nmoment, hurried on. For half an hour, or thereabouts, something like\r\ntrue feeling was at work within his heart. He had once more pressed\r\nto his bosom the woman he had, at any rate, thought that he had\r\nloved. He had had his arm round her, and had kissed her, and the tone\r\nwith which she had called him by his name was still ringing in his\r\nears, "Burgo!" He repeated his own name audibly to himself, as though\r\nin this way he could recall her voice. He comforted himself for\r\na minute with the conviction that she loved him. He felt,--for\r\na moment,--that he could live on such consolation as that! But\r\namong mortals there could, in truth, hardly be one with whom such\r\nconsolation would go a shorter way. He was a man who required to have\r\nsuch comfort backed by pates and curacoa to a very large extent, and\r\nnow it might be doubted whether the amount of pates and curacoa at\r\nhis command would last him much longer.\r\n\r\nHe would not go in and tell his aunt at once of his failure, as he\r\ncould gain nothing by doing so. Indeed, he thought that he would not\r\ntell his aunt at all. So he turned back from Grosvenor Square, and\r\nwent down to his club in St. James\'s Street, feeling that billiards\r\nand brandy-and-water might, for the present, be the best restorative.\r\nBut, as he went back, he blamed himself very greatly in the matter of\r\nthose bank-notes which he had allowed Lady Monk to take from him. How\r\nhad it come to pass that he had been such a dupe in her hands? When\r\nhe entered his club in St. James\'s Street his mind had left Lady\r\nGlencora, and was hard at work considering how he might best contrive\r\nto get that spoil out of his aunt\'s possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nFrom London to Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning everybody was stirring by times at Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s house in Park Lane, and the master of that house yawned no\r\nmore. There is some life in starting for a long journey, and the life\r\nis the stronger and the fuller if the things and people to be carried\r\nare numerous and troublesome. Lady Glencora was a little troublesome,\r\nand would not come down to breakfast in time. When rebuked on account\r\nof this manifest breach of engagement, she asserted that the next\r\ntrain would do just as well; and when Mr. Palliser proved to her,\r\nwith much trouble, that the next train could not enable them to\r\nreach Paris on that day, she declared that it would be much more\r\ncomfortable to take a week in going than to hurry over the ground in\r\none day. There was nothing she wanted so much as to see Folkestone.\r\n\r\n"If that is the case, why did not you tell me so before?" said Mr.\r\nPalliser, in his gravest voice. "Richard and the carriage went down\r\nyesterday, and are already on board the packet."\r\n\r\n"If Richard and the carriage are already on board the packet," said\r\nLady Glencora, "of course we must follow them, and we must put off\r\nthe glories of Folkestone till we come back. Alice, haven\'t you\r\nobserved that, in travelling, you are always driven on by some\r\nRichard or some carriage, till you feel that you are a slave?"\r\n\r\nAll this was trying to Mr. Palliser; but I think that he enjoyed it,\r\nnevertheless, and that he was happy when he found that he did get his\r\nfreight off from the Pimlico Station in the proper train.\r\n\r\nOf course Lady Glencora and Alice were very ill crossing the Channel;\r\nof course the two maids were worse than their mistresses; of course\r\nthe men kept out of their master\'s way when they were wanted, and\r\ndrank brandy-and-water with the steward down-stairs; and of course\r\nLady Glencora declared that she would not allow herself to be carried\r\nbeyond Boulogne that day;--but, nevertheless, they did get on to\r\nParis. Had Mr. Palliser become Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he had\r\nonce hoped, he could hardly have worked harder than he did work. It\r\nwas he who found out which carriage had been taken for them, and who\r\nput, with his own hands, the ladies\' dressing-cases and cloaks on to\r\nthe seats,--who laid out the novels, which, of course, were not read\r\nby the road,--and made preparations as though this stage of their\r\njourney was to take them a week, instead of five hours and a half.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! how I have slept!" said Lady Glencora, as they came near\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ve been tolerably comfortable," said Mr. Palliser,\r\njoyfully.\r\n\r\n"Since we got out of that horrid boat I have done pretty well. Why do\r\nthey make the boats so nasty? I\'m sure they do it on purpose."\r\n\r\n"It would be difficult to make them nice, I suppose?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"It is the sea that makes them uncomfortable," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Never mind; we shan\'t have any more of it for twelve months, at any\r\nrate. We can get to the Kurds, Alice, without getting into a packet\r\nagain. That, to my way of thinking, is the great comfort of the\r\nContinent. One can go everywhere without being seasick."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser said nothing, but he sighed as he thought of being absent\r\nfor a whole year. He had said that such was his intention, and would\r\nnot at once go back from what he himself had said. But how was he to\r\nlive for twelve months out of the House of Commons? What was he to\r\ndo with himself, with his intellect and his energy, during all these\r\ncoming dreary days? And then,--he might have been Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer! He might even now, at this very moment, have been upon\r\nhis legs, making a financial statement of six hours\' duration,\r\nto the delight of one-half of the House, and bewilderment of the\r\nother, instead of dragging cloaks across that dingy, dull, dirty\r\nwaiting-room at the Paris Station, in which British subjects are kept\r\nin prison while their boxes are being tumbled out of the carriages.\r\n\r\n"But we are not to stop here;--are we?" said Lady Glencora,\r\nmournfully.\r\n\r\n"No, dear;--I have given the keys to Richard. We will go on at once."\r\n\r\n"But can\'t we have our things?"\r\n\r\n"In about half an hour," pleaded Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must bear it, Alice?" said Lady Glencora as she got\r\ninto the carriage that was waiting for her.\r\n\r\nAlice thought of the last time in which she had been in that\r\nroom,--when George and Kate had been with her,--and the two girls\r\nhad been quite content to wait patiently while their trunks were\r\nbeing examined. But Alice was now travelling with great people,--with\r\npeople who never spoke of their wealth, or seemed ever to think of\r\nit, but who showed their consciousness of it at every turn of their\r\nlives. "After all," Alice had said to herself more than once, "I\r\ndoubt whether the burden is not greater than the pleasure."\r\n\r\nThey stayed in Paris for a week, and during that time Alice found\r\nthat she became very intimate with Mr. Palliser. At Matching she\r\nhad, in truth, seen but little of him, and had known nothing. Now\r\nshe began to understand his character, and learned how to talk to\r\nhim, She allowed him to tell her of things in which Lady Glencora\r\nresolutely persisted in taking no interest. She delighted him by\r\nwriting down in a little pocket-book the number of eggs that were\r\nconsumed in Paris every day, whereas Glencora protested that the\r\ninformation was worth nothing unless her husband could tell her how\r\nmany of the eggs were good, and how many bad. And Alice was glad\r\nto find that a hundred and fifty thousand female operatives were\r\nemployed in Paris, while Lady Glencora said it was a great shame,\r\nand that they ought all to have husbands. When Mr. Palliser explained\r\nthat that was impossible, because of the redundancy of the female\r\npopulation, she angered him very much by asserting that she saw a\r\ngreat many men walking about who, she was quite sure, had not wives\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\n"I do so wish you had married him!" Glencora said to Alice that\r\nevening. "You would always have had a pocket-book ready to write down\r\nthe figures, and you would have pretended to care about the eggs, and\r\nthe bottles of wine, and the rest of it. As for me, I can\'t do it. If\r\nI see an hungry woman, I can give her my money; or if she be a sick\r\nwoman, I can nurse her; or if I hear of a very wicked man, I can hate\r\nhim;--but I cannot take up poverty and crime in the lump. I never\r\nbelieve it all. My mind isn\'t big enough."\r\n\r\nThey went into no society at Paris, and at the end of a week were all\r\nglad to leave it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that Baden will be any better," Lady Glencora said;\r\n"but, you know, we can leave that again after a bit,--and so we shall\r\ngo on getting nearer to the Kurds."\r\n\r\nTo this, Mr. Palliser demurred. "I think we had better make up our\r\nmind to stay a month at Baden."\r\n\r\n"But why should we make up our minds at all?" his wife pleaded.\r\n\r\n"I like to have a plan," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"And so do I," said his wife,--"if only for the sake of not keeping\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing I hate so much as not carrying out my intentions,"\r\nsaid Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Lady Glencora shrugged her shoulders, and made a mock\r\ngrimace to her cousin. All this her husband bore for a while meekly,\r\nand it must be acknowledged that he behaved very well. But, then,\r\nhe had his own way in everything. Lady Glencora did not behave very\r\nwell,--contradicting her husband, and not considering, as, perhaps,\r\nshe ought to have done, the sacrifice he was making on her behalf.\r\nBut, then, she had her own way in nothing.\r\n\r\nShe had her own way in almost nothing; but on one point she did\r\nconquer her husband. He was minded to go from Paris back to Cologne,\r\nand so down the Rhine to Baden. Lady Glencora declared that she hated\r\nthe Rhine,--that, of all rivers, it was the most distasteful to\r\nher; that, of all scenery, the scenery of the Rhine was the most\r\nover-praised; and that she would be wretched all the time if she\r\nwere carried that way. Upon this, Mr. Palliser referred the matter\r\nto Alice; and she, who had last been upon the Rhine with her\r\ncousins Kate and George Vavasor, voted for going to Baden by way of\r\nStrasbourg.\r\n\r\n"We will go by Strasbourg, then," said Mr. Palliser, gallantly.\r\n\r\n"Not that I want to see that horrid church again," said Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Everything is alike horrid to you, I think," said her husband. "You\r\nare determined not to be contented, so that it matters very little\r\nwhich way we go."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the truth," said his wife. "It does matter very little."\r\n\r\nThey got on to Baden,--with very little delay at Strasbourg, and\r\nfound half an hotel prepared for their reception. Here the carriage\r\nwas brought into use for the first time, and the mistress of the\r\ncarriage talked of sending home for Dandy and Flirt. Mr. Palliser,\r\nwhen he heard the proposition, calmly assured his wife that the\r\nhorses would not bear the journey. "They would be so out of\r\ncondition," he said, "as not to be worth anything for two or three\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"I only meant to ask for them if they could come in a balloon," said\r\nLady Glencora.\r\n\r\nThis angered Mr. Palliser, who had really, for a few minutes, thought\r\nof pacifying his wife by sending for the horses.\r\n\r\n"Alice," she asked, one morning, "how many eggs are eaten in Baden\r\nevery morning before ten o\'clock?"\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser, who at the moment was in the act of eating one, threw\r\ndown his spoon, and pushed his plate from him.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Plantagenet?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"The matter!" he said. "But never mind; I am a fool to care for it."\r\n\r\n"I declare I didn\'t know that I had done anything wrong," said Lady\r\nGlencora. "Alice, do you understand what it is?"\r\n\r\nAlice said that she did understand very well.\r\n\r\n"Of course she understands," said Mr. Palliser. "How can she help\r\nit? And, indeed, Miss Vavasor, I am more unhappy than I can express\r\nmyself, to think that your comfort should be disturbed in this way."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I think Alice is doing very well," said Lady Glencora.\r\n"What is there to hurt her comfort? Nobody scolds her. Nobody tells\r\nher that she is a fool. She never jokes, or does anything wicked,\r\nand, of course, she isn\'t punished."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser, as he wandered that day alone through the gambling-rooms\r\nat the great Assembly House, thought that, after all, it might have\r\nbeen better for him to have remained in London, to have become\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and to have run all risks.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether it would be any harm if I were to put a few pieces\r\nof money on the table, just once?" Lady Glencora said to her cousin,\r\non the evening of the same day, in one of those gambling salons.\r\nThere had been some music on that evening in one side of the\r\nbuilding, and the Pallisers had gone to the rooms. But as neither\r\nof the two ladies would dance, they had strayed away into the other\r\napartments.\r\n\r\n"The greatest harm in the world!" said Alice; "and what on earth\r\ncould you gain by it? You don\'t really want any of those horrid\r\npeople\'s money?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I want,--something to live for,--some excitement.\r\nIs it not a shame that I see around me so many people getting\r\namusement, and that I can get none? I\'d go and sit out there, and\r\ndrink beer and hear the music, only Plantagenet wouldn\'t let me. I\r\nthink I\'ll throw one piece on to the table to see what becomes of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I shall leave you if you do," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"You are such a prude! It seems to me as if it must have been my\r\nspecial fate,--my good fate, I mean,--that has thrown me so much with\r\nyou. You look after me quite as carefully as Mr. Bott and Mrs. Marsham\r\never did; but as I chose you myself, I can\'t very well complain, and\r\nI can\'t very well get rid of you."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to get rid of me, Cora?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes. Do you know, there are moments when I almost make up my\r\nmind to go headlong to the devil,--when I think it is the best thing\r\nto be done. It\'s a hard thing for a woman to do, because she has to\r\nundergo so much obloquy before she gets used to it. A man can take to\r\ndrinking, and gambling and all the rest of it, and nobody despises\r\nhim a bit. The domestic old fogies give him lectures if they can\r\ncatch him, but he isn\'t fool enough for that. All he wants is money,\r\nand he goes away and has his fling. Now I have plenty of money,--or,\r\nat any rate, I had,--and I never got my fling yet. I do feel so\r\ntempted to rebel, and go ahead, and care for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Throwing one piece on to the table wouldn\'t satisfy that longing."\r\n\r\n"You think I should be like the wild beast that has tasted blood,\r\nand can\'t be controlled. Look at all these people here. There are\r\nhusbands gambling, and their wives don\'t know it; and wives gambling,\r\nand their husbands don\'t know it. I wonder whether Plantagenet ever\r\nhas a fling? What a joke it would be to come and catch him!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you need be afraid."\r\n\r\n"Afraid! I should like him all the better for it. If he came to me,\r\nsome morning, and told me that he had lost a hundred thousand pounds,\r\nI should be so much more at my ease with him."\r\n\r\n"You have no chance in that direction, I\'m quite sure."\r\n\r\n"None the least. He\'d make a calculation that the chances were nine\r\nto seven against him, and then the speculation would seem to him to\r\nbe madness."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he\'d wish to try, even though he were sure of\r\nwinning."\r\n\r\n"Of course not. It would be a very vulgar kind of thing then.\r\nLook,--there\'s an opening there. I\'ll just put on one napoleon."\r\n\r\n"You shall not. If you do, I\'ll leave you at once. Look at the women\r\nwho are playing. Is there one there whom it would not disgrace you to\r\ntouch? Look what they are. Look at their cheeks, and their eyes, and\r\ntheir hands. Those men who rake about the money are bad enough, but\r\nthe women look like fiends."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to frighten me in that hobgoblin sort of way, you\r\nknow. I don\'t see anything the matter with any of the people."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of that young woman who has just got a handful of\r\nmoney from the man next to her?"\r\n\r\n"I think she is very happy. I never get money given to me by\r\nhandfuls, and the man to whom I belong gives me no encouragement\r\nwhen I want to amuse myself." They were now standing near to one end\r\nof the table, and suddenly there came to be an opening through the\r\ncrowd up to the table itself. Lady Glencora, leaving Alice\'s side, at\r\nonce stepped up and deposited a piece of gold on one of the marked\r\ncompartments. As soon as she placed it she retreated again with\r\nflushed face, and took hold of Alice\'s arm. "There," she said,\r\n"I have done it." Alice, in her dismay, did not know what step to\r\ntake. She could not scold her friend now, as the eyes of many were\r\nturned upon them, nor could she, of course, leave her, as she had\r\nthreatened. Lady Glencora laughed with her peculiar little low\r\nlaughter, and stood her ground. "I was determined you shouldn\'t\r\nfrighten me out of it," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady Glencora at Baden.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the ministers at the table had in the meantime gone on with\r\nthe cards, and had called the game; and another minister had gently\r\npushed three or four more pieces of gold up to that which Lady\r\nGlencora had flung down, and had then cunningly caught her eye, and,\r\nwith all the courtesy of which he was master, had pushed them further\r\non towards her. She had supposed herself to be unknown there in the\r\nsalon, but no doubt all the croupiers and half the company knew well\r\nenough who was the new customer at the table. There was still the\r\nspace open, near to which she stood, and then someone motioned to her\r\nto come and take up the money which she had won. She hesitated, and\r\nthen the croupier asked her, in that low, indifferent voice which\r\nthese men always use, whether she desired that her money should\r\nremain. She nodded her head to him, and he at once drew the money\r\nback again to the spot on which she had placed the first napoleon.\r\nAgain the cards were turned up softly, again the game was called,\r\nand again she won. The money was dealt out to her,--on this occasion\r\nwith a full hand. There were lying there between twenty and thirty\r\nnapoleons, of which she was the mistress. Her face had flushed\r\nbefore, but now it became very red. She caught hold of Alice, who was\r\nliterally trembling beside her, and tried to laugh again. But there\r\nwas that in her eye which told Alice that she was really frightened.\r\nSome one then placed a chair for her at the table, and in her\r\nconfusion, not knowing what she was to do, she seated herself. "Come\r\naway," said Alice, taking hold of her, and disregarding everything\r\nbut her own purpose, in the agony of the moment. "You must come\r\naway! You shall not sit there!" "I must get rid of that money," said\r\nGlencora, trying to whisper her words, "and then I will come away."\r\nThe croupier again asked her if the money was to remain, and she\r\nagain nodded her head. Everybody at the table was now looking at\r\nher. The women especially were staring at her,--those horrid women\r\nwith vermilion cheeks, and loud bonnets half off their heads, and\r\nhard, shameless eyes, and white gloves, which, when taken off in the\r\nardour of the game, disclosed dirty hands. They stared at her with\r\nthat fixed stare which such women have, and Alice saw it all, and\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\nAgain she won. "Leave it," said Alice, "and come away." "I can\'t\r\nleave it," said Glencora. "If I do, there\'ll be a fuss. I\'ll go\r\nthe next time." What she said was, of course, in English, and was\r\nprobably understood by no one near her; but it was easy to be seen\r\nthat she was troubled, and, of course, those around her looked at\r\nher the more because of her trouble. Again that little question and\r\nanswer went on between her and the croupier, and on this occasion\r\nthe money was piled up on the compartment--a heap of gold which made\r\nenvious the hearts of many who stood around there. Alice had now\r\nboth her hands on the back of the chair, needing support. If the\r\ndevil should persist, and increase that stock of gold again, she\r\nmust go and seek for Mr. Palliser. She knew not what else to do. She\r\nunderstood nothing of the table, or of its laws; but she supposed\r\nall those ministers of the game to be thieves, and believed that\r\nall villainous contrivances were within their capacity. She thought\r\nthat they might go on adding to that heap so long as Lady Glencora\r\nwould sit there, presuming that they might thus get her into their\r\nclutches. Of course, she did not sift her suspicions. Who does at\r\nsuch moments? "Come away at once, and leave it," she said, "or I\r\nshall go." At that moment the croupier raked it all up, and carried\r\nit all away; but Alice did not see that this had been done. A hand\r\nhad been placed on her shoulder, and as she turned round her face\r\nher eyes met those of Mr. Palliser. "It is all gone," said Glencora,\r\nlaughing. And now she, turning round, also saw her husband. "I am so\r\nglad that you are come," said Alice. "Why did you bring her here?"\r\nsaid Mr. Palliser. There was anger in his tone, and anger in his eye.\r\nHe took his wife\'s arm upon his own, and walked away quickly, while\r\nAlice followed them alone. He went off at once, down the front steps\r\nof the building, towards the hotel. What he said to his wife, Alice\r\ndid not hear; but her heart was swelling with the ill-usage to which\r\nshe herself was subjected. Though she might have to go back alone\r\nto England, she would tell him that he was ill-treating her. She\r\nfollowed him on, up into their drawing-room, and there he stood with\r\nthe door open in his hand for her, while Lady Glencora threw herself\r\nupon a sofa, and burst out into affected laughter. "Here\'s a piece of\r\nwork," she said, "about a little accident."\r\n\r\n"An accident!" said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Yes, an accident. You don\'t suppose that I sat down there meaning to\r\nwin all that money?" Whereupon he looked at her with scorn.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser," said Alice, "you have treated me this evening in a\r\nmanner I did not expect from you. It is clear that you blame me."\r\n\r\n"I have not said a word, Miss Vavasor."\r\n\r\n"No; you have not said a word. You know well how to show your anger\r\nwithout speaking. As I do not choose to undergo your displeasure, I\r\nwill return to England by myself."\r\n\r\n"Alice! Alice!" said Glencora, jumping up, "that is nonsense! What\r\nis all this trumpery thing about? Leave me, because he chooses to be\r\nangry about nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Is it nothing that I find my wife playing at a common\r\ngambling-table, surrounded by all that is wretched and\r\nvile,--established there, seated, with heaps of gold before her?"\r\n\r\n"You wrong me, Plantagenet," said Glencora. "There was only one heap,\r\nand that did not remain long. Did it, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to make you ashamed of anything," he said.\r\n\r\n"I certainly don\'t like being ashamed," she answered; "and don\'t feel\r\nany necessity on this occasion."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t object, Mr. Palliser," said Alice, "I will go to bed.\r\nYou can think over all this at night,--and so can I. Good night,\r\nGlencora." Then Alice took her candle, and marched off to her own\r\nroom, with all the dignity of which she was mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nFrom Baden to Lucerne.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second week in July saw Mr. Palliser\'s party, carriage and all,\r\nestablished at Lucerne, in Switzerland, safe beyond the reach of\r\nthe German gambling tables. Alice Vavasor was still with them; and\r\nthe reader will therefore understand that that quarrel about Lady\r\nGlencora\'s wickedness had been settled without any rupture. It had\r\nbeen settled amicably, and by the time that they had reached Lucerne,\r\nAlice was inclined to acknowledge that the whole thing was not worth\r\nnotice; but for many days her anger against Mr. Palliser had not been\r\nremoved, and her intimacy with him had been much checked. It was now\r\na month since the occurrence of that little scene in the salon at\r\nBaden, which was described in the last chapter,--since Mr. Palliser\r\nhad marched off with his wife, leaving Alice to follow as she best\r\ncould by herself. After that, as the reader may remember, he had\r\nalmost told her that she was to be blamed because of his wife\'s\r\nindiscretion; and when she had declared her intention of leaving him,\r\nand making her way home to England by herself, he had answered her\r\nnot at all, and had allowed her to go off to her own room under the\r\nfull ban of his displeasure. Since that he had made no apology to\r\nher; he had not, in so many words, acknowledged that he had wronged\r\nher; but Alice had become aware that he intended to apologize by his\r\nconduct, and she had been content so far to indulge his obstinacy as\r\nto accept this conduct on his part in lieu of any outspoken petition\r\nfor pardon. The acknowledgement of a mistake and the asking for grace\r\nis almost too much for any woman to expect from such a man as Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning after the scene in question, Lady Glencora\r\nhad gone into Alice\'s bedroom, and had found her cousin in her\r\ndressing-gown, packing up her things, or looking as though she\r\nintended to do so. "You are not such a fool," she said, "as to think\r\nanything of what occurred yesterday?" Alice assured her that, whether\r\nfool or not, she did think a great deal of it. "In point of fact,"\r\nsaid Alice, "I can\'t stand it. He expects me to take care of you, and\r\nchooses to show himself offended if you don\'t do just what he thinks\r\nproper; whereas, as you know well enough, I have not the slightest\r\ninfluence over you." All these positions Lady Glencora contradicted\r\nvigorously. Of course, Mr. Palliser had been wrong in walking out\r\nof the Assembly Rooms as he had done, leaving Alice behind him. So\r\nmuch Lady Glencora admitted. But this had come of his intense anxiety.\r\n"And you know what a man he is," said his wife--"how stiff, and hard,\r\nand unpleasant he can be without meaning it."--"There is no reason\r\nwhy I should bear his unpleasantness," said Alice. "Yes, there\r\nis,--great reason. You are to do it for the sake of friendship. And\r\nas for my not doing what you tell me, you know that\'s not true."\r\n\r\n"Did I not beg you to keep away from the table?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you did, and of course I was naughty; but that was only\r\nonce. Alice, I want you more than I ever wanted you before. I cannot\r\ntell you more now, but you must stay with me."\r\n\r\nAlice consented to come down to breakfast without any immediate\r\ncontinuance of her active preparations for going, and at last, of\r\ncourse, she stayed. When she entered the breakfast-room Mr. Palliser\r\ncame up to her, and offered her his hand. She had no alternative\r\nbut to take it, and then seated herself. That there was an intended\r\napology in the manner in which he offered her toast and butter, she\r\nwas convinced; and the special courtesy with which he handed her to\r\nthe carriage, when she and Lady Glencora went out for their drive,\r\nafter dinner, was almost as good as a petition for pardon. So the\r\nthing went on, and by degrees Mr. Palliser and Miss Vavasor were again\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBut Alice never knew in what way the matter was settled between\r\nMr. Palliser and his wife, or whether there was any such settling.\r\nProbably there was none. "Of course, he understands that it didn\'t\r\nmean anything," Lady Glencora had said. "He knows that I don\'t want\r\nto gamble." But let that be as it might, their sojourn at Baden was\r\ncurtailed, and none of the party went up again to the Assembly Rooms\r\nbefore their departure.\r\n\r\nBefore establishing themselves at Lucerne they made a little tour\r\nround by the Falls of the Rhine and Zurich. In their preparations\r\nfor this journey, Alice made a struggle, but a struggle in vain, to\r\navoid a passage through Basle. It was only too clear to her that Mr.\r\nPalliser was determined to go by Basle. She could not bring herself\r\nto say that she had recollections connected with that place which\r\nwould make a return to it unpleasant to her. If she could have\r\nsaid as much, even to Glencora, Mr. Palliser would no doubt have\r\ngone round,--round by any more distant route that might have been\r\nnecessary to avoid that eternal gateway into Switzerland. But she\r\ncould not say it. She was very averse to talking about herself and\r\nher own affairs, even with her cousin. Of course Lady Glencora knew\r\nthe whole story of Mr. John Grey and his rejection,--and knew much\r\nalso of that other story of Mr. George Vavasor. And, of course, like\r\nall Alice\'s friends, she hated George Vavasor, and was prepared to\r\nreceive Mr. John Grey with open arms, if there were any possibility\r\nthat her cousin would open her arms to him also. But Alice was so\r\nstubborn about her own affairs that her friend found it almost\r\nimpossible to speak of them. "It is not that you trouble me," Alice\r\nonce said, "but that you trouble yourself about that which is of no\r\nuse. It is all done and over; and though I know that I have behaved\r\nbadly,--very badly,--yet I believe that everything has been done for\r\nthe best. I am inclined to think that I can live alone, or perhaps\r\nwith my cousin Kate, more happily than I could with any husband."\r\n\r\n"That is such nonsense."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so; but, at any rate, I mean to try. We Vavasors don\'t seem\r\nto be good at marrying."\r\n\r\n"You want some one to break your heart for you; that\'s what you\r\nwant," said Lady Glencora. In saying this she knew but little of\r\nthe state of her friend\'s heart, and perhaps was hardly capable\r\nof understanding it. With all the fuss that Lady Glencora made to\r\nherself,--with all the tears that she had shed about her lost lover,\r\nand was so often shedding,--with all her continual thinking of the\r\nmatter, she had never loved Burgo Fitzgerald as Alice Vavasor had\r\nloved Mr. Grey. But her nature was altogether different to that of\r\nAlice. Love with her had in it a gleam of poetry, a spice of fun,\r\na touch of self-devotion, something even of hero-worship; but with\r\nit all there was a dash of devilry, and an aptitude almost for\r\nwickedness. She knew Burgo Fitzgerald to be a scapegrace, and she\r\nliked him the better on that account. She despised her husband\r\nbecause he had no vices. She would have given everything she had\r\nto Burgo,--pouring her wealth upon him with a total disregard of\r\nherself, had she been allowed to do so. She would have forgiven him\r\nsin after sin, and might perhaps have brought him round, at last, to\r\nsome life not absolutely reckless and wretched. But in all that she\r\nmight have done, there would have been no thoughtfulness,--no true\r\ncare either for him or for herself. And now that she was married\r\nthere was no thoughtfulness, or care either for herself or for her\r\nhusband. She was ready to sacrifice herself for him, if any sacrifice\r\nmight be required of her. She believed herself to be unfit for him,\r\nand would have submitted to be divorced,--or smothered out of the\r\nway, for the matter of that,--if the laws of the land would have\r\npermitted it. But she had never for a moment given to herself the\r\ntask of thinking what conduct on her part might be the best for his\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nBut Alice\'s love had been altogether of another kind,--and I am by no\r\nmeans sure that it was better suited for the work of this work-a-day\r\nworld than that of her cousin. It was too thoughtful. I will not\r\nsay that there was no poetry in it, but I will say that it lacked\r\nromance. Its poetry was too hard for romance. There was certainly\r\nin it neither fun nor wickedness; nor was there, I fear, so large\r\na proportion of hero-worship as there always should be in a girl\'s\r\nheart when she gives it away. But there was in it an amount\r\nof self-devotion which none of those near to her had hitherto\r\nunderstood,--unless it were that one to whom the understanding of it\r\nwas of the most importance. In all the troubles of her love, of her\r\nengagements, and her broken promises, she had thought more of others\r\nthan of herself,--and, indeed, those troubles had chiefly come from\r\nthat self-devotion. She had left John Grey because she feared that\r\nshe would do him no good as his wife,--that she would not make him\r\nhappy; and she had afterwards betrothed herself for a second time to\r\nher cousin, because she believed that she could serve him by marrying\r\nhim. Of course she had been wrong. She had been very wrong to give up\r\nthe man she did love, and more wrong again in suggesting to herself\r\nthe possibility of marrying the man she did not love. She knew that\r\nshe had been wrong in both, and was undergoing repentance with very\r\nbitter inward sackcloth. But she said little of all this even to her\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nThey went to Lucerne by Basle, and put up at the big hotel with the\r\nbalcony over the Rhine, which Alice remembered so well. On the first\r\nevening of her arrival she found herself again looking down upon the\r\nriver, as though it might have been from the same spot which she had\r\noccupied together with George and Kate. But, in truth, that house is\r\nvery large, and has many bedrooms over the water. Who has ever been\r\nthrough Basle, and not stood in one of them, looking down upon the\r\nfather of waters? Here, on this very spot, in one of these balconies,\r\nwas brought to her a letter from her cousin Kate, which was filled\r\nwith tidings respecting her cousin George. Mr. Palliser brought it to\r\nher with his own hands, and she had no other alternative but to read\r\nit in his presence. "George has lost his election," the letter began.\r\nFor one moment Alice thought of her money, and the vain struggle\r\nin which it had been wasted. For one moment, something like regret\r\nfor the futility of the effort she had made came upon her. But it\r\npassed away at once. "It was worth our while to try it," she said to\r\nherself, and then went on with her letter. "I and Aunt Greenow are up\r\nin London," the letter went on to say, "and have just heard the news.\r\nThough I have been here for three days, and have twice sent word to\r\nhim to say so, he has not been near me. Perhaps it is best that he\r\nshould stay away, as I do not know how any words could pass between\r\nus that would be pleasant. The poll was finished this afternoon, and\r\nhe lost his election by a large majority. There were five candidates\r\naltogether for the two seats--three Liberals, and two Conservatives.\r\nThe other two Liberals were seated, and he was the last of the five.\r\nI continue to hear tidings about him from day to day,--or rather, my\r\naunt hears them and tells them to me, which fill me full of fears as\r\nto his future career. I believe that he has abandoned his business,\r\nand that he has now no source of income. I would willingly share what\r\nI have with him; or I would do more than that. After keeping back\r\nenough to repay you gradually what he owes you, I would give him all\r\nmy share of the income out of the estate. But I cannot do this while\r\nwe are presumed to be enemies. I am up here to see a lawyer as to\r\nsome steps which he is taking to upset grandpapa\'s will. The lawyer\r\nsays that it is all nonsense, and that George\'s lawyer is not really\r\nin earnest; but I cannot do anything till the matter is settled. Dear\r\nAlice, though so much of your money is for a time gone, I am bound to\r\ncongratulate you on your safety,--on what I may more truly call your\r\nescape. You will understand what my own feelings must be in writing\r\nthis, after all that I did to bring you and him together,--after all\r\nmy hopes and ambition respecting him. As for the money, it shall be\r\nrepaid. I do not think I shall ever dare to indulge in any strong\r\ndesire again. I think you will forgive me the injury I have done\r\nyou;--and I know that you will pity me.\r\n\r\n"I am here to see the London lawyer,--but not only for that. Aunt\r\nGreenow is buying her wedding clothes, and Captain Bellfield is in\r\nlodgings near to us, also buying his trousseau; or, as I should\r\nmore properly say, having it bought for him. I am hardly in a mood\r\nfor much mirth, but it is impossible not to laugh inwardly when\r\nshe discusses before me the state of his wardrobe, and proposes\r\neconomical arrangements--greatly to his disgust. At present, she\r\nholds him very tightly in hand, and makes him account for all his\r\nhours as well as all his money. \'Of course, he\'ll run wild directly\r\nhe\'s married,\' she said to me, yesterday; \'and, of course, there\'ll\r\nalways be a fight about it; but the more I do to tame him now, the\r\nless wild he\'ll be by-and-by. And though I dare say, I shall scold\r\nhim sometimes, I shall never quarrel with him.\' I have no doubt all\r\nthat is true; but what a fool she is to trouble herself with such a\r\nman. She says she does it for an occupation. I took courage to tell\r\nher once that a caged tiger would give her as much to do, and be less\r\ndangerous. She was angry at this, and answered me very sharply. I had\r\ntried my hand on a tiger, she said, and had felt his claws. She chose\r\nto sacrifice herself,--if a sacrifice it were to be,--when some good\r\nresult might be possible. I had nothing further to say; and from that\r\ntime to this we have been on the pleasantest terms possible as to the\r\nCaptain. They have settled with your father to take Vavasor Hall for\r\nthree years, and I suppose I shall stay with them till your return.\r\nWhat I may do then will depend entirely upon your doings. I feel\r\nmyself to be a desolate, solitary being, without any tie to any\r\nperson, or to any place. I never thought that I should feel the death\r\nof my grandfather to be such a loss to me as it has been. Except you,\r\nI have nothing left to me; and, as regards you, I have the unpleasant\r\nfeeling that I have for years been endeavouring to do you the worst\r\npossible injury, and that you must regard me as an enemy from whom\r\nyou have escaped indeed, but not without terrible wounds."\r\n\r\nAlice was always angered by any assumption that her conduct to Mr.\r\nGrey had been affected by the advice or influence of her cousin Kate.\r\nBut this very feeling seemed to preserve Kate from the worse anger,\r\nwhich might have been aroused against her, had Alice acknowledged the\r\ninjury which her cousin had in truth done to her. It was undoubtedly\r\ntrue that had Alice neither seen nor heard from Kate during the\r\nprogress of John Grey\'s courtship, John Grey would not have lost his\r\nwife. But against this truth Alice was always protesting within her\r\nown breast. She had been weak, foolish, irresolute,--and had finally\r\nacted with false judgement. So much she now admitted to herself. But\r\nshe would not admit that any other woman had persuaded her to such\r\nweakness. "She mistakes me," Alice thought, as she put up her letter.\r\n"She is not the enemy who has wounded me."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser, who had brought her the letter, was seated in the same\r\nbalcony, and while Alice had been reading, had almost buried himself\r\nin newspapers which conveyed intelligence as to the general elections\r\nthen in progress. He was now seated with a sheet of _The Times_ in\r\nhis hand, opened to its full extent,--for he had been too impatient\r\nto cut the paper,--and as he held it up in his hands before his eyes,\r\nwas completely hidden beneath it. Five or six other open papers were\r\naround him, and he had not spoken a word since he had commenced his\r\npresent occupation. Lady Glencora was standing on the other side of\r\nhim, and she also had received letters. "Sophy tells me that you are\r\nreturned for Silverbridge," she said at last.\r\n\r\n"Who? I! yes; I\'m returned," said Mr. Palliser, speaking with\r\nsomething like disdain in his voice as to the possibility of anybody\r\nhaving stood with a chance of success against him in his own family\r\nborough. For a full appreciation of the advantages of a private seat\r\nin the House of Commons let us always go to those great Whig families\r\nwho were mainly instrumental in carrying the Reform Bill. The house\r\nof Omnium had been very great on that occasion. It had given up\r\nmuch, and had retained for family use simply the single seat at\r\nSilverbridge. But that that seat should be seriously disputed hardly\r\nsuggested itself as possible to the mind of any Palliser. The\r\nPallisers and the other great Whig families have been right in this.\r\nThey have kept in their hands, as rewards for their own services to\r\nthe country, no more than the country is manifestly willing to give\r\nthem. "Yes; I have been returned," said Mr. Palliser. "I\'m sorry to\r\nsee, Miss Vavasor, that your cousin has not been so fortunate."\r\n\r\n"So I find," said Alice. "It will be a great misfortune to him."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I suppose so. Those Metropolitan elections cost so much trouble\r\nand so much money, and under the most favourable circumstances, are\r\nso doubtful. A man is never sure there till he has fought for his\r\nseat three or four times."\r\n\r\n"This has been the third time with him," said Alice, "and he is a\r\npoor man."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear," said Mr. Palliser, who himself knew nothing of such\r\nmisfortunes. "I have always thought that those seats should be\r\nleft to rich commercial men who can afford to spend money upon them.\r\nInstead of that, they are generally contested by men of moderate\r\nmeans. Another of my friends in the House has been thrown out."\r\n\r\n"Who is that unfortunate?" asked Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott," said the unthinking husband.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bott out!" exclaimed Lady Glencora. "Mr. Bott thrown out! I am so\r\nglad. Alice, are you not glad? The red-haired man, that used to stand\r\nabout, you know, at Matching;--he has lost his seat in Parliament. I\r\nsuppose he\'ll go and stand about somewhere in Lancashire, now."\r\n\r\nA very indiscreet woman was poor Lady Glencora. Mr. Palliser\'s face\r\nbecame black beneath _The Times_ newspaper. "I did not know," said\r\nhe, "that my friend Mr. Bott and Miss Vavasor were enemies."\r\n\r\n"Enemies! I don\'t suppose they were enemies," said Glencora. "But he\r\nwas a man whom no one could help observing,--and disliking."\r\n\r\n"He was a man I specially disliked," said Alice, with great courage.\r\n"He may be very well in Parliament; but I never met a man who could\r\nmake himself so disagreeable in society. I really did feel myself\r\nconstrained to be his enemy."\r\n\r\n"Bravo, Alice!" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I hope he did nothing at Matching, to--to--to--," began Mr. Palliser,\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n"Nothing especially to offend me, Mr. Palliser,--except that he had\r\na way that I especially dislike of trying to make little secret\r\nconfidences."\r\n\r\n"And then he was so ugly," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I felt certain that he endeavoured to do mischief," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Of course he did," said Lady Glencora; "and he had a habit of\r\nrubbing his head against the papers in the rooms, and leaving a mark\r\nbehind him that was quite unpardonable."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser was effectually talked down, and felt himself constrained\r\nto abandon his political ally. Perhaps he did this the easier as the\r\nloss which Mr. Bott had just suffered would materially interfere with\r\nhis political utility. "I suppose he will remain now among his own\r\npeople," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Let us hope he will," said Lady Glencora,--"and that his own people\r\nwill appreciate the advantage of his presence." Then there was\r\nnothing more said about Mr. Bott.\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and while they were still sitting among their letters\r\nand newspapers, there came a shout along the water, and the noise of\r\nmany voices from the bridge. Suddenly, there shot down before them\r\nin the swift running stream the heads of many swimmers in the river,\r\nand with the swimmers came boats carrying their clothes. They went\r\nby almost like a glance of light upon the waters, so rapid was the\r\ncourse of the current. There was the shout of voices,--the quick\r\npassage of the boats,--the uprising, some half a dozen times, of\r\nthe men\'s hands above the surface; and then they were gone down the\r\nriver, out of sight,--like morsels of wood thrown into a cataract,\r\nwhich are borne away instantly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how I wish I could do that!" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"It seems to be very dangerous," said Mr. Palliser. "I don\'t know how\r\nthey can stop themselves."\r\n\r\n"Why should they want to stop themselves?" said Lady Glencora. "Think\r\nhow cool the water must be, and how beautiful to be carried along so\r\nquickly, and to go on, and on, and on! I suppose we couldn\'t try it?"\r\n\r\nAs no encouragement was given to this proposition, Lady Glencora did\r\nnot repeat it; but stood leaning on the rail of the balcony, and\r\nlooking enviously down upon the water. Alice was, of course, thinking\r\nof that other evening, when perhaps the same swimmers had come down\r\nunder the bridge and before the balcony, and where George Vavasor was\r\nsitting in her presence. It was, I think, on that evening, that she\r\nmade up her mind to separate herself from Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\nOn the day after that, Mr. Palliser and his party went on to\r\nLucerne, making that journey, as I have said, by slow stages; taking\r\nSchaffhausen and Zurich in their way. At Lucerne, they established\r\nthemselves for some time, occupying nearly a dozen rooms in the great\r\nhotel which overlooks the lake. Here there came to them a visitor, of\r\nwhose arrival I will speak in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nAt Lucerne.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that Mr. Palliser did not much enjoy this\r\npart of his tour abroad. When he first reached Lucerne there was no\r\none there with whom he could associate pleasantly, nor had he any\r\noccupation capable of making his time run easily. He did not care for\r\nscenery. Close at his elbow was the finest to be had in Europe; but\r\nit was nothing to him. Had he been simply journeying through Lucerne\r\nat the proper time of the year for such a journey, when the business\r\nof the Session was over, and a little change of air needed, he could\r\nhave enjoyed the thing in a moderate way, looking about him, passing\r\non, and knowing that it was good for him to be there at that moment.\r\nBut he had none of that passion for mountains and lakes, none of\r\nthat positive joy in the heather, which would have compensated many\r\nanother man for the loss of all that Mr. Palliser was losing. His mind\r\nwas ever at home in the House of Commons, or in that august assembly\r\nwhich men call the Cabinet, and of the meetings of which he read from\r\nweek to week the simple records. Therein were mentioned the names of\r\nthose heroes to whom Fortune had been so much kinder than she had\r\nbeen to him; and he envied them. He took short, solitary walks, about\r\nthe town, over the bridges, and along the rivers, making to himself\r\nthe speeches which he would have made to full houses, had not his\r\nwife brought ruin upon all his hopes. And as he pictured to himself\r\nthe glorious successes which probably never would have been his had\r\nhe remained in London, so did he prophesy to himself an absolute and\r\nirremediable downfall from all political power as the result of his\r\nabsence,--having, in truth, no sufficient cause for such despair. As\r\nyet, he was barely thirty, and had he been able to judge his own case\r\nas keenly as he could have judged the case of another, he would have\r\nknown that a short absence might probably raise his value in the\r\nestimation of others rather than lower it. But his personal annoyance\r\nwas too great to allow of his making such calculations aright. So he\r\nbecame fretful and unhappy; and though he spoke no word of rebuke\r\nto his wife, though he never hinted that she had robbed him of his\r\nglories, he made her conscious by his manner that she had brought him\r\nto this miserable condition.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora herself had a love for the mountains and lakes, but it\r\nwas a love of that kind which requires to be stimulated by society,\r\nand which is keenest among cold chickens, picnic-pies, and the flying\r\nof champagne corks. When they first entered Switzerland she was very\r\nenthusiastic, and declared her intention of climbing up all the\r\nmountains, and going through all the passes. She endeavoured to\r\ninduce her husband to promise that she should be taken up Mont Blanc.\r\nAnd I think she would have carried this on, and would have been taken\r\nup Mont Blanc, had Mr. Palliser\'s aspirations been congenial. But they\r\nwere not congenial, and Lady Glencora soon lost all her enthusiasm.\r\nBy the time that they were settled at Lucerne she had voted the\r\nmountains to be bores, and had almost learned to hate the lake, which\r\nshe declared always made her wet through when she got into a small\r\nboat, and sea-sick when she put her foot in a large one. At Lucerne\r\nthey made no acquaintances, Mr. Palliser being a man not apt to new\r\nfriendships. They did not even dine at the public table, though Lady\r\nGlencora had expressed a wish to do so. Mr. Palliser did not like it,\r\nand of course Lady Glencora gave way. There were, moreover, some\r\nmarital passages which were not pleasant to a third person. They did\r\nnot scold each other; but Lady Glencora would make little speeches of\r\nwhich her husband disapproved. She would purposely irritate him by\r\ncontinuing her tone of badinage, and then Mr. Palliser would become\r\nfretful, and would look as though the cares of the world were too\r\nmany for him. I cannot, therefore, say that Alice had much to make\r\nthe first period of her sojourn at Lucerne a period of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut when they had been there about a fortnight, a stranger arrived,\r\nwhose coming at any rate lent the grace of some excitement to their\r\nlives. Their custom was to breakfast at nine,--or as near nine as\r\nLady Glencora could be induced to appear,--and then Mr. Palliser would\r\nread till three. At that hour he would walk forth by himself, after\r\nhaving handed the two ladies into their carriage, and they would\r\nbe driven about for two hours. "How I do hate this carriage," Lady\r\nGlencora said one day. "I do so wish it would come to grief, and be\r\nbroken to pieces. I wonder whether the Swiss people think that we are\r\ngoing to be driven about here for ever." There were moments, however,\r\nwhich seemed to indicate that Lady Glencora had something to tell\r\nher cousin, which, if told, would alter the monotony of their lives.\r\nAlice, however, would not press her for her secret.\r\n\r\n"If you have anything to tell, why don\'t you tell it?" Alice once\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You are so hard," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"So you tell me very often," Alice replied; "and it is not\r\ncomplimentary. But hard or soft, I won\'t make a petition for your\r\nconfidence." Then Lady Glencora said something savage, and the\r\nsubject was dropped for a while.\r\n\r\nBut we must go back to the stranger. Mr. Palliser had put the ladies\r\ninto their carriage, and was standing between the front door of the\r\nhotel and the lake on a certain day, doubting whether he would walk\r\nup the hill to the left or turn into the town on the right, when he\r\nwas accosted by an English gentleman, who, raising his hat, said that\r\nhe believed that he spoke to Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I am Mr. Palliser," said our friend, very courteously, returning the\r\nsalute, and smiling as he spoke. But though he smiled, and though\r\nhe was courteous, and though he raised his hat, there was something\r\nin his look and voice which would not have encouraged any ordinary\r\nstranger to persevere. Mr. Palliser was not a man with whom it was\r\neasy to open an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"My name is John Grey," said the stranger.\r\n\r\nThen the smile was dropped, the look of extreme courtesy disappeared,\r\nthe tone of Mr. Palliser\'s voice was altered, and he put out his\r\nhand. He knew enough of Mr. John Grey\'s history to be aware that\r\nMr. John Grey was a man with whom he might permit himself to become\r\nacquainted. After the interchange of a very few words, the two men\r\nstarted off for a walk together.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you don\'t wish to meet the carriage?" said Mr. Palliser. "If\r\nso, we had better go through the town and up the river."\r\n\r\nThey went through the town, and up the river, and when Mr. Palliser,\r\non his return, was seen by Alice and Lady Glencora, he was alone.\r\nThey dined together, and nothing was said. Together they sauntered\r\nout in the evening, and together came in and drank their tea; but\r\nstill nothing was said. At last, Alice and her cousin took their\r\ncandles from Mr. Palliser\'s hands and left the sitting-room for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said Lady Glencora, as soon as they were in the passage\r\ntogether, "I have been dying for this time to come. I could not speak\r\nbefore, or I should have made blunders, and so would you. Let us go\r\ninto your room at once. Who do you think is here, at Lucerne, in this\r\nhouse, at this very moment?"\r\n\r\nAlice knew at once who it was. She knew, immediately, that Mr. Grey\r\nhad followed her, though no word had been written to her or spoken to\r\nher on the subject since that day on which he himself had told her\r\nthat they would meet abroad. But though she was quite sure, she did\r\nnot mention his name. "Who is it, Glencora?" she asked, very calmly.\r\n\r\n"Whom in all the world would you best like to see?" said Glencora.\r\n\r\n"My cousin Kate, certainly," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Then it is not your cousin Kate. And I don\'t believe you;--or else\r\nyou\'re a fool."\r\n\r\nAlice was accustomed to Lady Glencora\'s mode of talking, and\r\ntherefore did not think much of this. "Perhaps I am a fool," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Only I know you are not. But I am not at all so sure as to your\r\nbeing no hypocrite. The person I mean is a gentleman, of course. Why\r\ndon\'t you show a little excitement, at any rate? When Plantagenet\r\ntold me, just before dinner, I almost jumped out of my shoes. He was\r\ngoing to tell you himself after dinner, in the politest way in the\r\nworld, no doubt, and just as the servants were carrying away the\r\napples. I thought it best to save you from that; but, I declare, I\r\nbelieve I might have left him to do it; it would have had no effect\r\nupon you. Who is it that has come, do you suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I know now," said Alice, very calmly, "that Mr. John Grey\r\nhas come."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. John Grey has come. He is here in this house at this\r\nminute;--or, more probably, waiting outside by the lake till he shall\r\nsee a light in your bedroom." Then Lady Glencora paused for a moment,\r\nwaiting that Alice might say something. But Alice said nothing.\r\n"Well?" said Lady Glencora, rising up from her chair. "Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Have you nothing to say? Is it the same to you as though Mr. Smith\r\nhad come?"\r\n\r\n"No; not exactly the same. I am quite alive to the importance of Mr.\r\nGrey\'s arrival, and shall probably lie awake all night thinking about\r\nit,--if it will do you any good to know that; but I don\'t feel that I\r\nhave much to say about it."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had let Mr. Palliser tell you, in an ordinary way, before\r\nall the servants. I do indeed."\r\n\r\n"It would not have made much difference."\r\n\r\n"Not the least, I believe. I wonder whether you ever did care for\r\nanybody in your life,--for him, or for that other one, or for\r\nanybody. For nobody, I believe;--except your cousin Kate. Still\r\nwaters, they say, run deep; and sometimes I think your waters run\r\ntoo deep for me to fathom. I suppose I may go now, if you have got\r\nnothing more to say?"\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to say? Of course I know why he has come here.\r\nHe told me he should come."\r\n\r\n"And you have never said a word about it."\r\n\r\n"He told me he should come, and I thought it better not to say a word\r\nabout it. He might change his mind, or anything might happen. I told\r\nhim not to come; and it would have been much better that he should\r\nhave remained away."\r\n\r\n"Why;--why;--why would it be better?"\r\n\r\n"Because his being here will do no good to any one."\r\n\r\n"No good! It seems to me impossible but that it should do all the\r\ngood in the world. Look here, Alice. If you do not altogether make\r\nit up with him before to-morrow evening, I shall believe you to be\r\nutterly heartless. Had I been you I should have been in his arms\r\nbefore this. I\'ll go now, and leave you to lie awake, as you say\r\nyou will." Then she left the room, but returned in a moment to ask\r\nanother question. "What is Plantagenet to say to him about seeing you\r\nto-morrow? Of course he has asked permission to come and call."\r\n\r\n"He may come if he pleases. You don\'t think I have quarrelled with\r\nhim, or would refuse to see him!"\r\n\r\n"And may we ask him to dine with us?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"And make up a picnic, and all the rest of it. In fact, he is to\r\nbe regarded as only an ordinary person. Well;--good night. I don\'t\r\nunderstand you, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether Alice understood herself. As soon as her\r\nfriend was gone, she put out her candle and seated herself at the\r\nopen window of her room, looking out upon the moonlight as it played\r\nupon the lake. Would he be there, thinking of her, looking up,\r\nperhaps, as Glencora had hinted, to see if he could distinguish her\r\nlight among the hundred that would be flickering across the long\r\nfront of the house. If it were so, at any rate he should not see her,\r\nso she drew the curtain, and sat there watching the lake. It was\r\na pity that he should have come, and yet she loved him dearly for\r\ncoming. It was a pity that he should have come, as his coming could\r\nlead to no good result. Of this she assured herself over and over\r\nagain, and yet she hardly knew why she was so sure of it. Glencora\r\nhad called her hard; but her conviction on that matter had not come\r\nfrom hardness. Now that she was alone, her heart was full of love, of\r\nthe soft romance of love towards this man; and yet she felt that she\r\nought not to marry him, even though he might still be willing to take\r\nher. That he was still willing to take her, that he desired to have\r\nher for his wife in spite of all the injury she had done him, there\r\ncould be no doubt. Why else had he followed her to Switzerland? And\r\nshe remembered, now at this moment, how he had told her at Cheltenham\r\nthat he would never consider her to be lost to him, unless she\r\nshould, in truth, become the wife of another man. Why, then, should\r\nit not be as he wished it?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alice.]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe asked herself the question, and did not answer it; but still she\r\nfelt that it might not be so. She had no right to such happiness\r\nafter the evil that she had done. She had been driven by a frenzy to\r\ndo that which she herself could not pardon; and having done it, she\r\ncould not bring herself to accept the position which should have been\r\nthe reward of good conduct. She could not analyse the causes which\r\nmade her feel that she must still refuse the love that was proffered\r\nto her; she could not clearly read her own thoughts; but the causes\r\nwere as I have said, and such was the true reading of her thoughts.\r\nHad she simply refused his hand after she had once accepted it,--had\r\nshe refused it, and then again changed her mind, she could have\r\nbrought herself to ask him to forgive her. But she had done so much\r\nmore than this, and so much worse! She had affianced herself to\r\nanother man since she had belonged to him,--since she had been his,\r\nas his future wife. What must he not think of her, and what not\r\nsuspect? Then she remembered those interviews which she had had with\r\nher cousin since she had written to him, accepting his offer. When\r\nhe had been with her in Queen Anne Street she had shrunk from all\r\noutward signs of a love which she did not feel. There had been no\r\ncaress between them. She had not allowed him to touch her with his\r\nlips. But it was impossible that the nature of that mad engagement\r\nbetween her and her cousin George should ever be made known to Mr.\r\nGrey. She sat there wiping the tears from her eyes as she looked for\r\nhis figure among the figures by the lake-side; but, as she sat there,\r\nshe promised herself no happiness from his coming. Oh! reader, can\r\nyou forgive her in that she had sinned against the softness of her\r\nfeminine nature? I think that she may be forgiven, in that she had\r\nnever brought herself to think lightly of her own fault.\r\n\r\nIf he were there, by the lake-side, she did not see him. I think we\r\nmay say that John Grey was not a man to console himself in his love\r\nby looking up at his lady\'s candle. He was one who was capable of\r\ndoing as much as most men in the pursuit of his love,--as he proved\r\nto be the case when he followed Alice to Cheltenham, and again to\r\nLondon, and now again to Lucerne; but I doubt whether a glimmer from\r\nher bedroom-window, had it been unmistakably her own glimmer, and not\r\nthat of some ugly old French woman who might chance to sleep next to\r\nher, would have done him much good. He had come to Lucerne with a\r\npurpose, which purpose, if it might be possible, he meant to carry\r\nout; but I think he was already in bed, being tired with long travel,\r\nbefore Lady Glencora had left Alice\'s room.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast the next morning nothing was said for a while about the\r\nnew arrival. At last Mr. Palliser ventured to speak. "Glencora has\r\ntold you, I think, that Mr. Grey is here? Mr. Grey is an old friend of\r\nyours, I believe?"\r\n\r\nAlice, keeping her countenance as well as she was able, said Mr. Grey\r\nhad been, and, indeed, was, a very dear friend of hers. Mr. Palliser\r\nknew the whole story, and what was the use of any little attempt at\r\ndissimulation? "I shall be glad to see him,--if you will allow me?"\r\nshe went on to say.\r\n\r\n"Glencora suggests that we should ask him to dinner," said Mr.\r\nPalliser; and then that matter was settled.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Grey did not wait till dinner-time to see Alice. Early in the\r\nmorning his card was brought up, and Lady Glencora, as soon as she\r\nsaw the name, immediately ran away.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you need not go," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I shall go," said her ladyship. "I know what\'s proper on\r\nthese occasions, if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nSo she went, whisking herself along the passages with a little run;\r\nand Mr. Grey, as he was shown into her ladyship\'s usual sitting-room,\r\nsaw the skirt of her ladyship\'s dress as she whisked herself off\r\ntowards her husband.\r\n\r\n"I told you I should come," he said, with his ordinary sweet smile.\r\n"I told you that I should follow you, and here I am."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and held it, pressing it warmly. She hardly knew\r\nwith what words first to address him, or how to get her hand back\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you,--as an old friend," she said; "but I\r\nhope--"\r\n\r\n"Well;--you hope what?"\r\n\r\n"I hope you have had some better cause for travelling than a desire\r\nto see me?"\r\n\r\n"No, dearest; no. I have had no better cause, and, indeed, none\r\nother. I have come on purpose to see you; and had Mr. Palliser\r\ntaken you off to Asia or Africa, I think I should have felt myself\r\ncompelled to follow him. You know why I follow you?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," said she,--not finding at the moment any other word that\r\nshe could say.\r\n\r\n"Because I love you. You see what a plain-spoken John Bull I am, and\r\nhow I come to the point at once. I want you to be my wife; and they\r\nsay that perseverance is the best way when a man has such a want as\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"You ought not to want it," she said, whispering the words as though\r\nshe were unable to speak them out loud.\r\n\r\n"But I do, you see. And why should I not want it?"\r\n\r\n"I am not fit to be your wife."\r\n\r\n"I am the best judge of that, Alice. You have to make up your mind\r\nwhether I am fit to be your husband."\r\n\r\n"You would be disgraced if you were to take me, after all that has\r\npassed;--after what I have done. What would other men say of you when\r\nthey knew the story?"\r\n\r\n"Other men, I hope, would be just enough to say, that when I had made\r\nup my mind, I was tolerably constant in keeping to it. I do not think\r\nthey could say much worse of me than that."\r\n\r\n"They would say that you had been jilted, and had forgiven the jilt."\r\n\r\n"As far as the forgiveness goes, they would tell the truth. But,\r\nindeed, Alice, I don\'t very much care what men do say of me."\r\n\r\n"But I care, Mr. Grey;--and though you may forgive me, I cannot\r\nforgive myself. Indeed I know now, as I have known all along, that\r\nI am not fit to be your wife. I am not good enough. And I have done\r\nthat which makes me feel that I have no right to marry anyone."\r\nThese words she said, jerking out the different sentences almost in\r\nconvulsions; and when she had come to the end of them, the tears\r\nwere streaming down her cheeks. "I have thought about it, and I\r\nwill not. I will not. After what has passed, I know that it will be\r\nbetter,--more seemly, that I should remain as I am."\r\n\r\nSoon after that she left him, not, however, till she had told him\r\nthat she would meet him again at dinner, and had begged him to treat\r\nher simply as a friend. "In spite of everything, I hope that we may\r\nalways be friends,--dear friends," she said.\r\n\r\n"I hope we may," he answered;--"the very dearest." And then he left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he again encountered Mr. Palliser, and having thought\r\nover the matter since his interview with Alice, he resolved to tell\r\nhis whole story to his new acquaintance,--not in order that he might\r\nask for counsel from him, for in this matter he wanted no man\'s\r\nadvice,--but that he might get some assistance. So the two men\r\nwalked off together, up the banks of the clear-flowing Reuss, and Mr.\r\nPalliser felt the comfort of having a companion.\r\n\r\n"I have always liked her," said Mr. Palliser, "though, to tell the\r\ntruth, I have twice been very angry with her."\r\n\r\n"I have never been angry with her," said the lover.\r\n\r\n"And my anger was in both instances unjust. You may imagine how\r\ngreat is my confidence in her, when I have thought she was the\r\nbest companion my wife could have for a long journey, taken under\r\ncircumstances that were--that were--; but I need not trouble you with\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nSo great had been the desolation of Mr. Palliser\'s life since his\r\nbanishment from London that he almost felt tempted to tell the story\r\nof his troubles to this absolute stranger. But he bethought himself\r\nof the blood of the Pallisers, and refrained. There are comforts\r\nwhich royalty may never enjoy, and luxuries in which such men as\r\nPlantagenet Palliser may not permit themselves to indulge.\r\n\r\n"About her and her character I have no doubt in the world," said\r\nGrey. "In all that she has done I think that I have seen her motives;\r\nand though I have not approved of them, I have always known them to\r\nbe pure and unselfish. She has done nothing that I did not forgive as\r\nsoon as it was done. Had she married that man, I should have forgiven\r\nher even that,--though I should have known that all her future life\r\nwas destroyed, and much of mine also. I think I can make her happy if\r\nshe will marry me, but she must first be taught to forgive herself.\r\nLiving as she is with you, and with your wife, she may, perhaps,\r\njust now be more under your influence and your wife\'s than she can\r\npossibly be under mine." Whereupon, Mr. Palliser promised that he\r\nwould do what he could. "I think she loves me," said Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser said that he was sure she did, though what ground he\r\nhad for such assurance I am quite unable to surmise. He was probably\r\ndesirous of saying the most civil thing which occurred to him.\r\n\r\nThe little dinner-party that evening was pleasant enough, and nothing\r\nmore was said about love. Lady Glencora talked nonsense to Mr. Grey,\r\nand Mr. Palliser contradicted all the nonsense which his wife talked.\r\nBut this was all done in such a way that the evening passed away\r\npleasantly. It was tacitly admitted among them that Mr. Grey was to be\r\nallowed to come among them as a friend, and Lady Glencora managed to\r\nsay one word to him aside, in which she promised to give him her most\r\ncordial cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nShowing How George Vavasor Received a Visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must go back for a few pages to scenes which happened in London\r\nduring this summer, so that the reader may understand Mr. Grey\'s\r\nposition when he reached Lucerne. He had undergone another quarrel\r\nwith George Vavasor, and something of the circumstances of that\r\nquarrel must be told.\r\n\r\nIt has been already said that George Vavasor lost his election for\r\nthe Chelsea Districts, after all the money which he had spent,--money\r\nwhich he had been so ill able to spend, and on which he had laid\r\nhis hands in a manner so disreputable! He had received two thousand\r\npounds from the bills which Alice had executed on his behalf,--or\r\nrather, had received the full value of three out of the four bills,\r\nand a part of the value of the fourth, on which he had been driven\r\nto raise what immediate money he had wanted by means of a Jew\r\nbill-discounter. One thousand pounds he had paid over at once into\r\nthe hands of Mr. Scruby, his Parliamentary election agent, towards\r\nthe expenses of his election; and when the day of polling arrived\r\nhad exactly in his hands the sum of five hundred pounds. Where\r\nhe was to get more when this was gone he did not know. If he\r\nwere successful,--if the enlightened constituents of the Chelsea\r\nDistricts, contented with his efforts on behalf of the River Bank,\r\nshould again send him to Parliament, he thought that he might still\r\ncarry on the war. A sum of ready money he would have in hand; and, as\r\nto his debts, he would be grandly indifferent to any consideration\r\nof them. Then there might be pickings in the way of a Member of\r\nParliament of his calibre. Companies,--mercantile companies,--would\r\nbe glad to have him as a director, paying him a guinea a day,\r\nor perhaps more, for his hour\'s attendance. Railways in want of\r\nvice-chairmen might bid for his services; and in the City he might\r\nturn that "M.P." which belonged to him to good account in various\r\nways. With such a knowledge of the City world as he possessed, he\r\nthought that he could pick up a living in London, if only he could\r\nretain his seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to do if he could not retain it? No sooner had Mr.\r\nScruby got the thousand pounds into his clutches than he pressed for\r\nstill more money. George Vavasor, with some show of justice on his\r\nside, pointed out to this all-devouring agent that the sum demanded\r\nhad already been paid. This Mr. Scruby admitted, declaring that he\r\nwas quite prepared to go on without any further immediate remittance,\r\nalthough by doing so might subject himself to considerable risk. But\r\nanother five hundred pounds, paid at once, would add greatly to the\r\nsafety of the seat; whereas eight hundred judiciously thrown in at\r\nthe present moment would make the thing quite secure. But Vavasor\r\nswore to himself that he would not part with another shilling. Never\r\nhad he felt such love for money as he did for that five hundred\r\npounds which he now held in his pocket. "It\'s no use," he said to Mr.\r\nScruby. "I have done what you asked, and would have done more had you\r\nasked for more at that time. As it is, I cannot make another payment\r\nbefore the election." Mr. Scruby shrugged his shoulders, and said\r\nthat he would do his best. But George Vavasor soon knew that the\r\nman was not doing his best,--that the man had, in truth, abandoned\r\nhis cause. The landlord of the "Handsome Man" jeered him when he\r\nwent there canvassing. "Laws, Mr. Vavasor!" said the landlord of\r\nthe "Handsome Man," "you\'re not at all the fellow for us chaps\r\nalong the river,--you ain\'t. You\'re afraid to come down with the\r\nstumpy,--that\'s what you are." George put his hand upon his purse,\r\nand acknowledged to himself that he had been afraid to come down with\r\nthe stumpy.\r\n\r\nFor the last five days of the affair George Vavasor knew that his\r\nchance was gone. Mr. Scruby\'s face, manner, and words, told the result\r\nof the election as plainly as any subsequent figures could do. He\r\nwould be absent when Vavasor called, or the clerk would say that he\r\nwas absent. He would answer in very few words, constantly shrugging\r\nhis shoulders. He would even go away and leave the anxious candidate\r\nwhile he was in the middle of some discussion as to his plans. It was\r\neasy to see that Mr. Scruby no longer regarded him as a successful\r\nman, and the day of the poll showed very plainly how right Mr. Scruby\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nGeorge Vavasor was rejected, but he still had his five hundred pounds\r\nin his pocket. Of course he was subject to that mortification which a\r\nman feels when he reflects that some little additional outlay would\r\nhave secured his object. Whether it might have been so, or not, who\r\ncan say? But there he was, with the gateway between the lamps barred\r\nagainst him, ex-Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts, with\r\nfive hundred pounds in his pocket, and little or nothing else that he\r\ncould call his own. What was he to do with himself?\r\n\r\nAfter trying to make himself heard upon the hustings when he was\r\nrejected, and pledging himself to stand again at the next election,\r\nhe went home to his lodgings in Cecil Street, and endeavoured\r\nto consider calmly his position in the world. He had lost his\r\ninheritance. He had abandoned one profession after another, and was\r\nnow beyond the pale of another chance in that direction. His ambition\r\nhad betrayed him, and there were no longer possible to him any hopes\r\nof political activity. He had estranged from himself every friend\r\nthat he had ever possessed. He had driven from him with violence the\r\ndevotion even of his sister. He had robbed the girl whom he intended\r\nto marry of her money, and had so insulted her that no feeling of\r\namity between them was any longer possible. He had nothing now but\r\nhimself and that five hundred pounds, which he still held in his\r\npocket. What should he do with himself and his money? He thought\r\nover it all with outer calmness for awhile, as he sat there in his\r\narm-chair.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment in which he had first become convinced that the\r\nelection would go against him, and that he was therefore ruined on\r\nall sides, he had resolved that he would be calm amidst his ruin.\r\nSometimes he assumed a little smile, as though he were laughing at\r\nhis own position. Mr. Bott\'s day of rejection had come before his own,\r\nand he had written to Mr. Bott a drolling note of consolation and mock\r\nsympathy. He had shaken hands with Mr. Scruby, and had poked his fun\r\nat the agent, bidding him be sure to send in his little bill soon. To\r\nall who accosted him, he replied in a subrisive tone; and he bantered\r\nCalder Jones, whose seat was quite sure, till Calder Jones began to\r\nhave fears that were quite unnecessary. And now, as he sat himself\r\ndown, intending to come to some final decision as to what he would\r\ndo, he maintained the same calmness. He smiled in the same way,\r\nthough there was no one there to see the smile. He laughed even\r\naudibly once or twice, as he vainly endeavoured to persuade himself\r\nthat he was able to regard the world and all that belonged to it as a\r\nbubble.\r\n\r\nThere came to him a moment in which he laughed out very audibly. "Ha!\r\nha!" he shouted, rising up from his chair, and he walked about the\r\nroom, holding a large paper-knife in his hand. "Ha! ha!" Then he\r\nthrew the knife away from him, and thrusting his hands into his\r\ntrousers-pockets, laughed again--"Ha! ha!" He stood still in the\r\ncentre of the room, and the laughter was very plainly visible on his\r\nface, had there been anybody there to see it.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was a change upon his face, as he stood there all\r\nalone, and his eyes became fierce, and the cicatrice that marred\r\nhis countenance grew to be red and ghastly, and he grinned with his\r\nteeth, and he clenched his fists as he still held them within his\r\npockets. "Curse him!" he said out loud. "Curse him, now and for\r\never!" He had broken down in his calmness, when he thought of that\r\nold man who had opposed him during his life, and had ruined him at\r\nhis death. "May all the evils which the dead can feel cling to him\r\nfor ever and ever!" His laughter was all gone, and his assumed\r\ntranquillity had deserted him. Walking across the room, he struck his\r\nfoot against a chair; upon this, he took the chair in his hands, and\r\nthrew it across the room. But he hardly arrested the torrent of his\r\nmaledictions as he did so. What good was it that he should lie to\r\nhimself by that mock tranquillity, or that false laughter? He lied\r\nto himself no longer, but uttered a song of despair that was true\r\nenough. What should he do? Where should he go? From what fountain\r\nshould he attempt to draw such small draughts of the water of comfort\r\nas might support him at the present moment? Unless a man have some\r\nsuch fountain to which he can turn, the burden of life cannot be\r\nborne. For the moment, Vavasor tried to find such fountain in a\r\nbottle of brandy which stood near him. He half filled a tumbler, and\r\nthen, dashing some water on it, swallowed it greedily. "By ----!" he\r\nsaid, "I believe it is the best thing a man can do."\r\n\r\nBut where was he to go? to whom was he to turn himself? He went to\r\na high desk which stood in one corner of the room, and unlocking it,\r\ntook out a revolving pistol, and for a while carried it about with\r\nhim in his hand. He turned it up, and looked at it, and tried the\r\nlock, and snapped it without caps, to see that the barrel went\r\nround fairly. "It\'s a beggarly thing to do," he said, and then\r\nhe turned the pistol down again; "and if I do do it, I\'ll use it\r\nfirst for another purpose." Then he poured out for himself more\r\nbrandy-and-water, and having drunk it, he threw himself upon the\r\nsofa, and seemed to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut he did not sleep, and by-and-by there came a slight single knock\r\nat the door, which he instantly answered. But he did not answer it\r\nin the usual way by bidding the comer to come in. "Who\'s there?" he\r\nsaid. Then the comer attempted to enter, turning the handle of the\r\ndoor. But the door had been locked, and the key was on Vavasor\'s\r\nside. "Who\'s there?" he asked again, speaking out loudly, but in an\r\nangry voice. "It is I," said a woman\'s voice. "D----ation!" said\r\nGeorge Vavasor.\r\n\r\nThe woman heard him, but she made no sign of having heard him. She\r\nsimply remained standing where she was till something further should\r\nbe done within. She knew the man well, and knew that she must bide\r\nhis time. She was very patient,--and for the time was meek, though\r\nit might be that there would come an end to her meekness. Vavasor,\r\nwhen he had heard her voice, and knew who was there, had again thrown\r\nhimself on the sofa. There flashed across his mind another thought or\r\ntwo as to his future career,--another idea about the pistol, which\r\nstill lay upon the table. Why should he let the intruder in, and\r\nundergo the nuisance of a disagreeable interview, if the end of all\r\nthings might come in time to save him from such trouble? There he lay\r\nfor ten minutes thinking, and then the low single knock was heard\r\nagain. He jumped upon his feet, and his eyes were full of fire. He\r\nknew that it was useless to bid her go and leave him. She would sit\r\nthere, if it were through the whole night. Should he open the door\r\nand strangle her, and pass out over her with the pistol in his hand,\r\nso that he might make that other reckoning which he desired to\r\naccomplish, and then never come back any more?\r\n\r\nHe took a turn through the room, and then walked gently up to the\r\ndoor, and undid the lock. He did not open the door, nor did he bid\r\nhis visitor enter, but having made the way easy for her if she chose\r\nto come in, he walked back to the sofa and threw himself on it again.\r\nAs he did so, he passed his hand across the table so as to bring the\r\npistol near to himself at the place where he would be lying. She\r\npaused a moment after she had heard the sound of the key, and then\r\nshe made her way into the room. He did not at first speak to her. She\r\nclosed the door very gently, and then, looking around, came up to the\r\nfoot of the sofa. She paused a moment, waiting for him to address\r\nher; but as he said nothing, but lay there looking at her, she was\r\nthe first to speak. "George," she said, "what am I to do?"\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about thirty years of age, dressed poorly, in old\r\ngarments, but still with decency, and with some attempt at feminine\r\nprettiness. There were flowers in the bonnet on her head, though\r\nthe bonnet had that unmistakable look of age which is quite as\r\ndistressing to bonnets as it is to women, and the flowers themselves\r\nwere battered and faded. She had long black ringlets on each cheek,\r\nhanging down much below her face, and brought forward so as to hide\r\nin some degree the hollowness of her jaws. Her eyes had a peculiar\r\nbrightness, but now they left on those who looked at her cursorily\r\nno special impression as to their colour. They had been blue,--that\r\ndark violet blue, which is so rare, but is sometimes so lovely. Her\r\nforehead was narrow, her mouth was small, and her lips were thin;\r\nbut her nose was perfect in its shape, and, by the delicacy of its\r\nmodelling, had given a peculiar grace to her face in the days when\r\nthings had gone well with her, when her cheeks had been full with\r\nyouth and good living, and had been dimpled by the softness of love\r\nand mirth. There were no dimples there now, and all the softness\r\nwhich still remained was that softness which sorrow and continual\r\nmelancholy give to suffering women. On her shoulders she wore a light\r\nshawl, which was fastened to her bosom with a large clasp brooch. Her\r\nfaded dress was supported by a wide crinoline, but the under garment\r\nhad lost all the grace of its ancient shape, and now told that\r\nwoman\'s tale of poverty and taste for dress which is to be read in\r\nthe outward garb of so many of Eve\'s daughters. The whole story was\r\ntold so that those who ran might read it. When she had left her home\r\nthis afternoon, she had struggled hard to dress herself so that\r\nsomething of the charm of apparel might be left to her; but she had\r\nknown of her own failure at every twist that she had given to her\r\ngown, and at every jerk with which she had settled her shawl. She\r\nhad despaired at every push she had given to her old flowers, vainly\r\nstriving to bring them back to their old forms; but still she had\r\npersevered. With long tedious care she had mended the old gloves\r\nwhich would hardly hold her fingers. She had carefully hidden the\r\nrags of her sleeves. She had washed her little shrivelled collar, and\r\nhad smoothed it out painfully. It had been a separate grief to her\r\nthat she could find no cuffs to put round her wrists;--and yet she\r\nknew that no cuffs could have availed her anything. Nothing could\r\navail her now. She expected nothing from her visit; yet she had come\r\nforth anxiously, and would have waited there throughout the whole\r\nnight had access to his room been debarred to her. "George," she\r\nsaid, standing at the bottom of the sofa, "what am I to do?"\r\n\r\nAs he lay there with his face turned towards her, the windows were at\r\nher back, and he could see her very plainly. He saw and appreciated\r\nthe little struggles she had made to create by her appearance some\r\nreminiscence of her former self. He saw the shining coarseness of\r\nthe long ringlets which had once been softer than silk. He saw the\r\nsixpenny brooch on her bosom where he had once placed a jewel, the\r\nprice of which would now have been important to him. He saw it all,\r\nand lay there for a while, silently reading it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let me stand here," she said, "without speaking a word to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to stand there," he said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well, George. I know you don\'t want me to stand\r\nhere. I know you don\'t want to see me ever again."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"I know it. Of course I know it. But what am I to do? Where am I to\r\ngo for money? Even you would not wish that I should starve?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, too. I certainly would not wish it. I should be\r\ndelighted to hear that you had plenty to eat and plenty to drink, and\r\nplenty of clothes to wear. I believe that\'s what you care for the\r\nmost, after all."\r\n\r\n"It was only for your sake,--because you liked it."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I did like it; but that has come to an end, as have all my\r\nother likings. You know very well that I can do nothing more for you.\r\nWhat good do you do yourself by coming here to annoy me? Have I not\r\ntold you over and over again that you were never to look for me here?\r\nIs it likely that I should give you money now, simply because you\r\nhave disobeyed me!"\r\n\r\n"Where else was I to find you?"\r\n\r\n"Why should you have found me at all? I don\'t want you to find me. I\r\nshall give you nothing;--not a penny. You know very well that we\'ve\r\nhad all that out before. When I put you into business I told you that\r\nwe were to see no more of each other."\r\n\r\n"Business!" she said. "I never could make enough out of the shop to\r\nfeed a bird."\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t my fault. Putting you there cost me over a hundred\r\npounds, and you consented to take the place."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t consent. I was obliged to go there because you took my\r\nother home away from me."\r\n\r\n"Have it as you like, my dear. That was all I could do for you;--and\r\nmore than most men would have done, when all things are considered."\r\nThen he got up from the sofa, and stood himself on the hearthrug,\r\nwith his back to the fireplace. "At any rate, you may be sure of\r\nthis, Jane;--that I shall do nothing more. You have come here to\r\ntorment me, but you shall get nothing by it."\r\n\r\n"I have come here because I am starving."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing for you. Now go;" and he pointed to the door.\r\nNevertheless, for more than three years of his life this woman had\r\nbeen his closest companion, his nearest friend, the being with whom\r\nhe was most familiar. He had loved her according to his fashion of\r\nloving, and certainly she had loved him. "Go," he said repeating the\r\nword very angrily. "Do as I bid you, or it will be the worse for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Will you give me a sovereign?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I will give you nothing. I have desired you not to come to me\r\nhere, and I will not pay for you coming."\r\n\r\n"Then I will not go;" and the woman sat down upon a chair at the foot\r\nof the table. "I will not go till you have given me something to buy\r\nfood. You may put me out of the room if you can, but I will lie at\r\nthe door of the stairs. And if you get me out of the house, I will\r\nsit upon the door-step."\r\n\r\n"If you play that game, my poor girl, the police will take you."\r\n\r\n"Let them. It has come to that with me, that I care for nothing. Out\r\nof this I will not go till you give me money--unless I am put out."\r\n\r\nAnd for this she had dressed herself with so much care, mending her\r\ngloves, and darning her little fragments of finery! He stood looking\r\nat her, with his hands thrust deep into his pockets,--looking at her\r\nand thinking what he had better do to rid himself of her presence. If\r\nhe even quite resolved to take that little final journey of which we\r\nhave spoken, with the pistol in his hand, why should he not go and\r\nleave her there? Or, for the matter of that, why should he not make\r\nher his heir to all remainder of his wealth? What he still had left\r\nwas sufficient to place her in a seventh heaven of the earth. He\r\ncared but little for her, and was at this moment angry with her; but\r\nthere was no one for whom he cared more, and no friend with whom he\r\nwas less angry. But then his mind was not quite made up as to that\r\nfinal journey. Therefore he desired to rid himself and his room of\r\nthe nuisance of her presence.\r\n\r\n"Jane," he said, looking at her again with that assumed tranquillity\r\nof which I have spoken, "you talk of starving and of being ruined,--"\r\n\r\n"I am starving. I have not a shilling in the world."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it may be a comfort to you in your troubles to know that\r\nI am, at any rate, as badly off as you are? I won\'t say that I am\r\nstarving, because I could get food to eat at this moment if I wanted\r\nit; but I am utterly ruined. My property,--what should have been\r\nmine,--has been left away from me. I have lost the trumpery seat\r\nin Parliament for which I have paid so much. All my relations have\r\nturned their backs upon me--"\r\n\r\n"Are you not going to be married?" she said, rising quickly from her\r\nchair and coming close to him.\r\n\r\n"Married! No;--but I am going to blow my brains out. Look at that\r\npistol, my girl. Of course you won\'t think that I am in earnest,--but\r\nI am."\r\n\r\nShe looked up into his face piteously. "Oh! George," she said, "you\r\nwon\'t do that?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Oh! George," she said, "you won\'t do that?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"But I shall do that. There is nothing else left for me to do. You\r\ntalk to me about starving. I tell you that I should have no objection\r\nto be starved, and so be put an end to in that way. It\'s not so bad\r\nas some other ways when it comes gradually. You and I, Jane, have not\r\nplayed our cards very well. We have staked all that we had, and we\'ve\r\nbeen beaten. It\'s no good whimpering after what\'s lost. We\'d better\r\ngo somewhere else and begin a new game."\r\n\r\n"Go where?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Ah!--that\'s just what I can\'t tell you."\r\n\r\n"George," she said, "I\'ll go anywhere with you. If what you say is\r\ntrue,--if you\'re not going to be married, and will let me come to\r\nyou, I will work for you like a slave. I will indeed. I know I\'m\r\npoorly looking now--"\r\n\r\n"My girl, where I\'m going, I shall not want any slave; and as for\r\nyour looks--when you go there too,--they\'ll be of no matter, as far\r\nas I am able to judge."\r\n\r\n"But, George, where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Wherever people do go when their brains are knocked out of them; or,\r\nrather, when they have knocked out their own brains,--if that makes\r\nany difference."\r\n\r\n"George,"--she came up to him now, and took hold of him by the front\r\nof his coat, and for the moment he allowed her to do so,--"George,\r\nyou frighten me. Do not do that. Say that you will not do that!"\r\n\r\n"But I am just saying that I shall."\r\n\r\n"Are you not afraid of God\'s anger? You and I have been very wicked."\r\n\r\n"I have, my poor girl. I don\'t know much about your wickedness. I\'ve\r\nbeen like Topsy;--indeed I am a kind of second Topsy myself. But\r\nwhat\'s the good of whimpering when it\'s over?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t over; it isn\'t over,--at any rate for you."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew how I could begin again. But all this is nonsense,\r\nJane, and you must go."\r\n\r\n"You must tell me, first, that you are not going to--kill yourself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose I shall do it to-night,--or, perhaps, not to-morrow.\r\nVery probably I may allow myself a week, so that your staying here\r\ncan do no good. I merely wanted to make you understand that you are\r\nnot the only person who has come to grief."\r\n\r\n"And you are not going to be married?"\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m not going to be married, certainly."\r\n\r\n"And I must go now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think you\'d better go now." Then she rose and went, and he\r\nlet her leave the room without giving her a shilling! His bantering\r\ntone, in speaking of his own position, had been successful. It had\r\ncaused her to take herself off quietly. She knew enough of his usual\r\nmanner to be aware that his threats of self destruction were probably\r\nunreal; but, nevertheless, what he had said had created some feeling\r\nin her heart which had induced her to yield to him, and go away in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nShowing How George Vavasor Paid a Visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly seven o\'clock in the evening,--a hot, July\r\nevening,--when the woman went from Vavasor\'s room, and left him there\r\nalone. It was necessary that he should immediately do something.\r\nIn the first place he must dine, unless he meant to carry out his\r\nthreat, and shoot himself at once. But he had no such intention as\r\nthat, although he stood for some minutes with the pistol in his hand.\r\nHe was thinking then of shooting some one else. But he resolved that,\r\nif he did so at all, he would not do it on that evening, and he\r\nlocked up the pistol again in the standing desk. After that, he took\r\nup some papers, referring to steam packets, which were lying on his\r\ntable. They contained the programmes of different companies, and\r\nshowed how one vessel went on one day to New York, and another on\r\nanother day would take out a load of emigrants for New Zealand and\r\nAustralia. "That\'s a good line," said he, as he read a certain\r\nprospectus. "They generally go to the bottom, and save a man from any\r\nfurther trouble on his own account." Then he dressed himself, putting\r\non his boots and coat, and went out to his club for his dinner.\r\n\r\nLondon was still fairly full,--that is to say, the West End was not\r\ndeserted, although Parliament had been broken up two months earlier\r\nthan usual, in preparation for the new elections. Many men who had\r\ngone down into the country were now back again in town, and the\r\ndining-room at the club was crowded. Men came up to him condoling\r\nwith him, telling him that he was well rid of a great nuisance, that\r\nthe present Members for the Chelsea Districts would not sit long, or\r\nthat there would be another general election in a year or two. To all\r\nthese little speeches he made cheerful replies, and was declared by\r\nhis acquaintance to bear his disappointment well. Calder Jones came\r\nto him and talked hunting talk, and Vavasor expressed his intention\r\nof being at Roebury in November. "You had better join our club," said\r\nCalder Jones. In answer to which Vavasor said that he thought he\r\nwould join the club. He remained in the smoking-room till nearly\r\neleven; then he took himself home, and remained up half the night\r\ndestroying papers. Every written document on which he could lay his\r\nhands he destroyed. All the pigeon-holes of his desk were emptied\r\nout, and their contents thrown into the flames. At first he looked at\r\nthe papers before he burned them; but the trouble of doing so soon\r\ntired him, and he condemned them all, as he came to them, without\r\nexamination. Then he selected a considerable amount of his clothes,\r\nand packed up two portmanteaus, folding his coats with care, and\r\ninspecting his boots narrowly, so that he might see which, out of\r\nthe large number before him, it might be best worth his while to\r\ntake with him. When that was done, he took from his desk a bag of\r\nsovereigns, and, pouring them out upon the table, he counted them out\r\ninto parcels of twenty-five each, and made them up carefully into\r\nrouleaus with paper. These, when complete, he divided among the two\r\nportmanteaus and a dressing-bag which he also packed and a travelling\r\ndesk, which he filled with papers, pens, and the like. But he put\r\ninto it no written document. He carefully looked through his linen,\r\nand anything that had been marked with more than his initials he\r\nrejected. Then he took out a bundle of printed cards, and furnished a\r\ncard-case with them. On these cards was inscribed the name of Gregory\r\nVance. When all was finished, he stood for awhile with his back\r\nto the fireplace contemplating his work. "After all," he said to\r\nhimself, "I know that I shall never start; and, if I do, nobody can\r\nhinder me, and my own name would be as good as any other. As for a\r\nman with such a face as mine not being known, that is out of the\r\nquestion." But still he liked the arrangements which he had made, and\r\nwhen he had looked at them for awhile he went to bed.\r\n\r\nHe was up early the next morning, and had some coffee brought to him\r\nby the servant of the house, and as he drank it he had an interview\r\nwith his landlady. "He was going," he said;--"going that very day."\r\nIt might be possible that he would change his mind; but as he would\r\ndesire to start without delay, if he did go, he would pay her then\r\nwhat he owed her, and what would be due for her lodgings under a\r\nweek\'s notice. The woman stared, and curtseyed, and took her money.\r\nVavasor, though he had lately been much pressed for money, had never\r\nbeen so foolish as to owe debts where he lived. "There will be some\r\nthings left about, Mrs. Bunsby," he said, "and I will get you to keep\r\nthem till I call or send." Mrs. Bunsby said that she would, and then\r\nlooked her last at him. After that interview she never saw him again.\r\n\r\nWhen he was left alone he put on a rough morning coat, and taking up\r\nthe pistol, placed it carefully in his pocket, and sallied forth. It\r\nwas manifest enough that he had some decided scheme in his head, for\r\nhe turned quickly towards the West when he reached the Strand, went\r\nacross Trafalgar Square to Pall Mall East, and then turned up Suffolk\r\nStreet. Just as he reached the club-house at the corner he paused and\r\nlooked back, facing first one way and then the other. "The chances\r\nare that I shall never see anything of it again," he said to himself.\r\nThen he laughed in his own silent way, shook his head slightly, and\r\nturning again quickly on his heel, walked up the street till he\r\nreached the house of Mr. Jones, the pugilistic tailor. The reader, no\r\ndoubt, has forgotten all he ever knew of Mr. Jones, the pugilistic\r\ntailor. It can soon be told again. At Mr. Jones\'s house John Grey\r\nlodged when he was in London, and he was in London at this moment.\r\n\r\nVavasor rang the bell, and as soon as the servant came he went\r\nquickly into the house, and passed her in the passage. "Mr. Grey is\r\nat home," he said. "I will go up to him." The girl said that Mr. Grey\r\nwas at home, but suggested that she had better announce the gentleman.\r\nBut Vavasor was already halfway up the stairs, and before the girl\r\nhad reached the first landing place, he had entered Mr. Grey\'s room\r\nand closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nGrey was sitting near the open window, in a dressing-gown, and was\r\nreading. The breakfast things were on the table, but he had not as\r\nyet breakfasted. As soon as he saw George Vavasor, he rose from his\r\nchair quickly, and put down his book. "Mr. Vavasor," he said, "I\r\nhardly expected to see you in my lodgings again!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," said Vavasor; "but, nevertheless, here I am." He\r\nkept his right hand in the pocket which held the pistol, and held his\r\nleft hand under his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"May I ask why you have come?" said Grey.\r\n\r\n"I intend to tell you, at any rate, whether you ask me or not. I have\r\ncome to declare in your own hearing,--as I am in the habit of doing\r\noccasionally behind your back,--that you are a blackguard,--to spit\r\nin your face, and defy you." As he said this he suited his action to\r\nhis words, but without any serious result. "I have come here to see\r\nif you are man enough to resent any insult that I can offer you; but\r\nI doubt whether you are."\r\n\r\n"Nothing that you can say to me, Mr. Vavasor, will have any effect\r\nupon me;--except that you can, of course, annoy me."\r\n\r\n"And I mean to annoy you, too, before I have done with you. Will you\r\nfight me?"\r\n\r\n"Fight a duel with you,--with pistols? Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Then you are a coward, as I supposed."\r\n\r\n"I should be a fool if I were to do such a thing as that."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr. Grey. You managed to worm yourself into an intimacy\r\nwith my cousin, Miss Vavasor, and to become engaged to her. When she\r\nfound out what you were, how paltry, and mean, and vile, she changed\r\nher mind, and bade you leave her."\r\n\r\n"Are you here at her request?"\r\n\r\n"I am here as her representative."\r\n\r\n"Self-appointed, I think."\r\n\r\n"Then, sir, you think wrong. I am at this moment her affianced\r\nhusband; and I find that, in spite of all that she has said to\r\nyou,--which was enough, I should have thought, to keep any man of\r\nspirit out of her presence,--you still persecute her by going to her\r\nhouse, and forcing yourself upon her presence. Now, I give you two\r\nalternatives. You shall either give me your written promise never to\r\ngo near her again, or you shall fight me."\r\n\r\n"I shall do neither one nor the other,--as you know very well\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Stop till I have done, sir. If you have courage enough to fight me,\r\nI will meet you in any country. I will fight you here in London, or,\r\nif you are afraid of that, I will go over to France, or to America,\r\nif that will suit you better."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kind will suit me at all. I don\'t want to have\r\nanything to do with you."\r\n\r\n"Then you are a coward."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am;--but your saying so will not make me one."\r\n\r\n"You are a coward, and a liar, and a blackguard. I have given you the\r\noption of behaving like a gentleman, and you have refused it. Now,\r\nlook here. I have come here with arms, and I do not intend to leave\r\nthis room without using them, unless you will promise to give me the\r\nmeeting that I have proposed." And he took the pistol out of his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you are going to murder me?" Grey asked. There were\r\ntwo windows in the room, and he had been sitting near to that which\r\nwas furthest removed from the fireplace, and consequently furthest\r\nremoved from the bell, and his visitor was now standing immediately\r\nbetween him and the door. He had to think what steps he might best\r\ntake, and to act upon his decision instantly. He was by no means\r\na timid man, and was one, moreover, very little prone to believe\r\nin extravagant action. He did not think, even now, that this\r\ndisappointed, ruined man had come there with any intention of killing\r\nhim. But he knew that a pistol in the hands of an angry man is\r\ndangerous, and that it behoved him to do his best to rid himself of\r\nthe nuisance which now encumbered him. "Do you mean that you are\r\ngoing to murder me?" he had said.\r\n\r\n"I mean that you shall not leave this room alive unless you promise\r\nto meet me, and fight it out." Upon hearing this, Grey turned himself\r\ntowards the bell. "If you move a step, I will fire at you," said\r\nVavasor. Grey paused a moment, and looked him full in the face. "I\r\nwill," said Vavasor again.\r\n\r\n"That would be murder," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think that you will frighten me by ugly words," said Vavasor.\r\n"I am beyond that."\r\n\r\nGrey had stopped for a moment to fix his eyes on the other man\'s\r\nface; but it was only for a moment, and then he went on to the bell.\r\nHe had seen that the pistol was pointed at himself, and had once\r\nthought of rushing across the room at his adversary, calculating that\r\na shot fired at him as he did so might miss him, and that he would\r\nthen have a fair chance of disarming the madman. But his chief object\r\nwas to avoid any personal conflict, to escape the indignity of a\r\nscramble for the pistol,--and especially to escape the necessity of\r\na consequent appearance at some police-office, where he would have\r\nto justify himself, and answer the questions of a lawyer hired to\r\ncross-question him. He made, therefore, towards the bell, trusting\r\nthat Vavasor would not fire at him, but having some little thought\r\nalso as to the danger of the moment. It might be that everything was\r\nover for him now,--that the fatal hour had come, and that eternity\r\nwas close upon him. Something of the spirit of a prayer flashed\r\nacross his mind as he moved. Then he heard the click of the pistol\'s\r\nhammer as it fell, and was aware that his eyes were dazzled, though\r\nhe was unconscious of seeing any flame. He felt something in the air,\r\nand knew that the pistol had been fired;--but he did not know whether\r\nthe shot had struck him or had missed him. His hand was out for the\r\nbell-handle, and he had pulled it, before he was sure that he was\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\n"D----ation!" exclaimed the murderer. But he did not pull the trigger\r\nagain. Though the weapon had of late been so often in his hands, he\r\nforgot, in the agitation of the moment, that his missing once was but\r\nof small matter if he chose to go on with his purpose. Were there not\r\nfive other barrels for him, each making itself ready by the discharge\r\nof the other? But he had paused, forgetting, in his excitement, the\r\nuse of his weapon, and before he had bethought himself that the man\r\nwas still in his power, he heard the sound of the bell. "D----ation!"\r\nhe exclaimed. Then he turned round, left the room, hurried down the\r\nstairs, and made his way out into the street, having again passed the\r\ngirl on his way.\r\n\r\nGrey, when he perceived that his enemy was gone, turned round to look\r\nfor the bullet or its mark. He soon found the little hole in the\r\nwindow-shutter, and probing it with the point of his pencil, came\r\nupon the morsel of lead which might now just as readily have been\r\nwithin his own brain. There he left it for the time, and then made\r\nsome not inaccurate calculation as to the narrowness of his own\r\nescape. He had been standing directly between Vavasor and the\r\nshutter, and he found, from the height of the hole, that the shot\r\nmust have passed close beneath his ear. He remembered to have heard\r\nthe click of the hammer, but he could not remember the sound of the\r\nreport, and when the girl entered the room, he perceived at once from\r\nher manner that she was unaware that firearms had been used.\r\n\r\n"Has that gentleman left the house?" Grey asked. The girl said that\r\nhe had left the house. "Don\'t admit him again," said he;--"that\r\nis, if you can avoid it. I believe he is not in his right senses."\r\nThen he asked for Mr. Jones, his landlord, and in a few minutes the\r\npugilistic tailor was with him.\r\n\r\nDuring those few minutes he had been called upon to resolve what he\r\nwould do now. Would he put the police at once upon the track of the\r\nmurderer, who was, as he remembered too well, the first cousin of the\r\nwoman whom he still desired to make his wife? That cross-examination\r\nwhich he would have to undergo at the police-office, and again\r\nprobably in an assize court, in which all his relations with\r\nthe Vavasor family would be made public, was very vivid to his\r\nimagination. That he was called upon by duty to do something he felt\r\nalmost assured. The man who had been allowed to make such an attempt\r\nonce with impunity, might probably make it again. But he resolved\r\nthat he need not now say anything about the pistol to the pugilistic\r\ntailor, unless the tailor said something to him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jones," he said, "that man whom I had to put out of the room once\r\nbefore, has been here again."\r\n\r\n"Has there been another tussle, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No;--nothing of that kind. But we must take some steps to prevent\r\nhis getting in again, if we can help it."\r\n\r\nJones promised his aid, and offered to go at once to the police.\r\nTo this, however, Mr. Grey demurred, saying that he should himself\r\nseek assistance from some magistrate. Jones promised to be very\r\nvigilant as to watching the door; and then John Grey sat down to\r\nhis breakfast. Of course he thought much of what had occurred. It\r\nwas impossible that he should not think much of so narrow an escape.\r\nHe had probably been as near death as a man may well be without\r\nreceiving any injury; and the more he thought of it, the more\r\nstrongly he was convinced that he could not allow the thing to pass\r\nby without some notice, or some precaution as to the future.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock he went to Scotland Yard, and saw some\r\nofficer great in power over policemen, and told him all the\r\ncircumstances,--confidentially. The powerful officer recommended an\r\nequally confidential reference to a magistrate; and towards evening\r\na very confidential policeman in plain clothes paid a visit to\r\nVavasor\'s lodgings in Cecil Street. But Vavasor lodged there no\r\nlonger. Mrs. Bunsby, who was also very confidential,--and at her wits\'\r\nend because she could not learn the special business of the stranger\r\nwho called,--stated that Mr. George Vavasor left her house in a cab\r\nat ten o\'clock that morning, having taken with him such luggage as\r\nhe had packed, and having gone, "she was afraid, for good," as Mrs.\r\nBunsby expressed it.\r\n\r\nHe had gone for good, and at the moment in which the policeman was\r\nmaking the inquiry in Cecil Street, was leaning over the side of an\r\nAmerican steamer which had just got up her steam and weighed her\r\nanchor in the Mersey. He was on board at six o\'clock, and it was not\r\ntill the next day that the cabman was traced who had carried him to\r\nEuston Square Station. Of course, it was soon known that he had gone\r\nto America, but it was not thought worth while to take any further\r\nsteps towards arresting him. Mr. Grey himself was decidedly opposed to\r\nany such attempt, declaring his opinion that his own evidence would\r\nbe insufficient to obtain a conviction. The big men in Scotland Yard\r\nwere loth to let the matter drop. Their mouths watered after the job,\r\nand they had very numerous and very confidential interviews with John\r\nGrey. But it was decided that nothing should be done. "Pity!" said\r\none enterprising superintendent, in answer to the condolings of a\r\nbrother superintendent. "Pity\'s no name for it. It\'s the greatest\r\nshame as ever I knew since I joined the force. A man as was a Member\r\nof Parliament only last Session,--as belongs to no end of swell\r\nclubs, a gent as well known in London as any gent about the town! And\r\nI\'d have had him back in three months, as sure as my name\'s Walker."\r\nAnd that superintendent felt that his profession and his country were\r\nalike disgraced.\r\n\r\nAnd now George Vavasor vanishes from our pages, and will be heard of\r\nno more. Roebury knew him no longer, nor Pall Mall, nor the Chelsea\r\nDistricts. His disappearance was a nine days\' wonder, but the world\r\nat large knew nothing of the circumstances of that attempt in Suffolk\r\nStreet. Mr. Grey himself told the story to no one, till he told it to\r\nMr. Palliser at Lucerne. Mr. Scruby complained bitterly of the way in\r\nwhich Vavasor had robbed him; but I doubt whether Scruby, in truth,\r\nlost much by the transaction. To Kate, down in Westmoreland, no\r\ntidings came of her brother, and her sojourn in London with her aunt\r\nhad nearly come to an end before she knew that he was gone. Even then\r\nthe rumour reached her through Captain Bellfield, and she learned\r\nwhat few facts she knew from Mrs. Bunsby in Cecil Street.\r\n\r\n"He was always mysterious," said Mrs. Greenow, "and now he has\r\nvanished. I hate mysteries, and, as for myself, I think it will be\r\nmuch better that he should not come back again." Perhaps Kate was of\r\nthe same opinion, but, if so, she kept it to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nIn Which Come Tidings of Great Moment to All Pallisers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till they had been for a day or two together at Lucerne\r\nthat Mr. Grey told Mr. Palliser the story of George Vavasor\'s visit\r\nto him in Suffolk Street. Having begun the history of his connection\r\nwith Alice, he found himself obliged to go with it to the end, and as\r\nhe described the way in which the man had vanished from the sight of\r\nall who had known him,--that he had in truth gone, so as no longer to\r\nbe a cause of dread, he could not without dissimulation, keep back\r\nthe story of that last scene. "And he tried to murder you!" said Mr.\r\nPalliser. "He should be caught and,--and--" Mr. Palliser hesitated,\r\nnot liking to say boldly that the first cousin of the lady who was\r\nnow living with him ought to be hung.\r\n\r\n"It is better as it is," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"He actually walked into your rooms in the day time, and fired a\r\npistol at you as you were sitting at your breakfast! He did that in\r\nLondon, and then walked off and went abroad, as though he had nothing\r\nto fear!"\r\n\r\n"That was just it," said Grey.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser began to think that something ought to be done to make\r\nlife more secure in the metropolis of the world. Had he not known Mr.\r\nGrey, or been accustomed to see the other man in Parliament, he would\r\nnot have thought so much about it. But it was almost too much for him\r\nwhen he reflected that one man whom he now called his friend, had\r\nbeen nearly murdered in daylight, in the heart of his own part of\r\nLondon, by another man whom he had reckoned among his Parliamentary\r\nsupporters. "And he has got your money too!" said Palliser, putting\r\nall the circumstances of the case together. In answer to this Mr. Grey\r\nsaid that he hoped the loss might eventually be his own; but that he\r\nwas bound to regard the money which had been taken as part of Miss\r\nVavasor\'s fortune. "He is simply the greatest miscreant of whom I\r\never heard in my life," said Mr. Palliser. "The wonder is that Miss\r\nVavasor should ever have brought herself to--to like him." Then Mr.\r\nGrey apologized for Alice, explaining that her love for her cousin\r\nhad come from her early years; that the man himself was clever and\r\ncapable of assuming pleasant ways, and that he had not been wholly\r\nbad till ruin had come upon him. "He attempted public life and made\r\nhimself miserable by failing, as most men do who make that attempt,"\r\nsaid Grey. This was a statement which Mr. Palliser could not allow\r\nto pass without notice. Whereupon the two men got away from George\r\nVavasor and their own individual interests, and went on seriously\r\ndiscussing the merits and demerits of public life. "The end of it all\r\nis," said Grey at last, "that public men in England should be rich\r\nlike you, and not poor like that miserable wretch, who has now lost\r\neverything that the Fates had given him."\r\n\r\nThey continued to live at Lucerne in this way for a fortnight. Mr.\r\nGrey, though he was not unfrequently alone with Alice, did not plead\r\nhis suit in direct words; but continued to live with her on terms\r\nof close and easy friendship. He had told her that her cousin had\r\nleft England,--that he had gone to America immediately after his\r\ndisappointment in regard to the seat in Parliament, and that he would\r\nprobably not return. "Poor George!" Alice had said; "he is a man\r\nvery much to be pitied." "He is a man very much to be pitied," Grey\r\nhad replied. After that, nothing more was said between them about\r\nGeorge Vavasor. From Lady Glencora Alice did hear something; but\r\nLady Glencora herself had not heard the whole story. "I believe he\r\nmisbehaved himself, my dear," Lady Glencora said; "but then, you\r\nknow, he always does that. I believe that he saw Mr. Grey and insulted\r\nhim. Perhaps you had better not ask anything about it till by-and-by.\r\nYou\'ll be able to get anything out of him then." In answer to this\r\nAlice made her usual protest, and Lady Glencora, as was customary,\r\ntold her that she was a fool.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that Mr. Grey knew what he was about. Lady\r\nGlencora once scolded him very vehemently for not bringing the affair\r\nto an end. "We shall be going on to Italy before it\'s settled," she\r\nsaid; "and I don\'t suppose you can go with us, unless it is settled."\r\nMr. Grey protested that he had no intention of going to Italy in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\n"Then it will be put off for another year or two, and you are both of\r\nyou as old as Adam and Eve already."\r\n\r\n"We ancient people are never impatient," said Grey, laughing.\r\n\r\n"If I were you I would go to her and tell her, roundly, that she\r\nshould marry me, and then I would shake her. If you were to scold\r\nher, till she did not know whether she stood on her head or her\r\nheels, she would come to reason."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you try that, Lady Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t. It\'s she that always scolds me,--as you will her, when\r\nshe\'s your wife. You and Mr. Palliser are very much alike. You\'re both\r\nof you so very virtuous that no woman would have a chance of picking\r\na hole in your coats."\r\n\r\nBut Lady Glencora was wrong. Alice would, no doubt, have submitted\r\nherself patiently to her lover\'s rebukes, and would have confessed\r\nher own sins towards him with any amount of self-accusation that he\r\nmight have required; but she would not, on that account, have been\r\nmore willing to obey him in that one point, as to which he now\r\nrequired present obedience. He understood that she must be taught\r\nto forgive herself for the evil she had done,--to forgive herself,\r\nat any rate in part,--before she could be induced to return to\r\nher old allegiance to him. Thus they went on together at Lucerne,\r\npassing quiet, idle days,--with some pretence of reading, with a\r\nconsiderable amount of letter-writing, with boat excursions and pony\r\nexcursions,--till the pony excursions came to a sudden end by means\r\nof a violent edict, as to which, and the cause of it, a word or two\r\nmust be said just now. During these days of the boats and the ponies,\r\nthe carriage which Lady Glencora hated so vehemently was shut up in\r\nlimbo, and things went very pleasantly with her. Mr. Palliser received\r\npolitical letters from England, which made his mouth water sadly,\r\nand was often very fidgety. Parliament was not now sitting, and the\r\nGovernment would, of course, remain intact till next February. Might\r\nit not be possible that when the rent came in the Cabinet, he might\r\nyet be present at the darning? He was a constant man, and had once\r\ndeclared his intention of being absent for a year. He continued to\r\nspeak to Grey of his coming travels, as though it was impossible\r\nthat they should be over until after the next Easter. But he was\r\nsighing for Westminster, and regretting the blue books which were\r\naccumulating themselves at Matching;--till on a sudden, there came to\r\nhim tidings which upset all his plans, which routed the ponies, which\r\nmade everything impossible, which made the Alps impassable and the\r\nrailways dangerous, which drove Burgo Fitzgerald out of Mr. Palliser\'s\r\nhead, and so confused him that he could no longer calculate the\r\nblunders of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. All the Palliser\r\nworld was about to be moved from its lowest depths, to the summits of\r\nits highest mountains. Lady Glencora had whispered into her husband\'s\r\near that she thought it probable--; she wasn\'t sure;--she didn\'t\r\nknow. And then she burst out into tears on his bosom as he sat by her\r\non her bedside.\r\n\r\nHe was beside himself when he left her, which he did with the\r\nprimary intention of telegraphing to London for half a dozen leading\r\nphysicians. He went out by the lake side, and walked there alone for\r\nten minutes in a state of almost unconscious exaltation. He did not\r\nquite remember where he was, or what he was doing. The one thing in\r\nthe world which he had lacked; the one joy which he had wanted so\r\nmuch, and which is so common among men, was coming to him also. In a\r\nfew minutes it was to him as though each hand already rested on the\r\nfair head of a little male Palliser, of whom one should rule in the\r\nhalls at Gatherum, and the other be eloquent among the Commons of\r\nEngland. Hitherto,--for the last eight or nine months, since his\r\nfirst hopes had begun to fade,--he had been a man degraded in his own\r\nsight amidst all his honours. What good was all the world to him if\r\nhe had nothing of his own to come after him? We must give him his\r\ndue, too, when we speak of this. He had not had wit enough to hide\r\nhis grief from his wife; his knowledge of women and of men in social\r\nlife had not been sufficient to teach him how this should be done;\r\nbut he had wished to do it. He had never willingly rebuked her for\r\nhis disappointment, either by a glance of his eye, or a tone of his\r\nvoice; and now he had already forgiven everything. Burgo Fitzgerald\r\nwas a myth. Mrs. Marsham should never again come near her. Mr. Bott\r\nwas, of course, a thing abolished;--he had not even had the sense to\r\nkeep his seat in Parliament. Dandy and Flirt should feed on gilded\r\ncorn, and there should be an artificial moon always ready in the\r\nruins. If only those d----able saddle-ponies of Lucerne had not come\r\nacross his wife\'s path! He went at once into the yard and ordered\r\nthat the ponies should be abolished;--sent away, one and all, to the\r\nfurthest confines of the canton; and then he himself inspected the\r\ncushions of the carriage. Were they dry? As it was August in those\r\ndays, and August in Lucerne is a warm month, it may be presumed that\r\nthey were dry.\r\n\r\nHe then remembered that he had promised to send Alice up to his\r\nwife, and he hurried back into the house. She was alone in the\r\nbreakfast-room, waiting for him and for his wife. In these days, Mr.\r\nGrey would usually join them at dinner; but he seldom saw them before\r\neleven or twelve o\'clock in the day. Then he would saunter in and\r\njoin Mr. Palliser, and they would all be together till the evening.\r\nWhen the expectant father of embryo dukes entered the room, Alice\r\nperceived at once that some matter was astir. His manner was\r\naltogether changed, and he showed by his eye that he was eager and\r\nmoved beyond his wont. "Alice," he said, "would you mind going up to\r\nGlencora\'s room? She wishes to speak to you." He had never called\r\nher Alice before, and as soon as the word was spoken, he remembered\r\nhimself and blushed.\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t ill, I hope?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"No;--she isn\'t ill. At least I think she had better not get up quite\r\nyet. Don\'t let her excite herself, if you can help it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go to her at once," said Alice rising.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so much obliged to you;--but, Miss Vavasor--"\r\n\r\n"You called me Alice just now, Mr. Palliser, and I took it as a great\r\ncompliment."\r\n\r\nHe blushed again. "Did I? Very well. Then I\'ll do it again--if you\'ll\r\nlet me. But, if you please, do be as calm with her as you can. She\r\nis so easily excited, you know. Of course, if there\'s anything she\r\nfancies, we\'ll take care to get it for her; but she must be kept\r\nquiet." Upon this Alice left him, having had no moment of time to\r\nguess what had happened, or was about to happen; and he was again\r\nalone, contemplating the future glories of his house. Had he a\r\nthought for his poor cousin Jeffrey, whose nose was now so terribly\r\nout of joint? No, indeed. His thoughts were all of himself, and the\r\ngood things that were coming to him,--of the new world of interest\r\nthat was being opened for him. It would be better to him, this, than\r\nbeing Chancellor of the Exchequer. He would rather have it in store\r\nfor him to be father of the next Duke of Omnium, than make half a\r\ndozen consecutive annual speeches in Parliament as to the ways and\r\nmeans, and expenditure of the British nation! Could it be possible\r\nthat this foreign tour had produced for him this good fortune? If so,\r\nhow luckily had things turned out! He would remember even that ball\r\nat Lady Monk\'s with gratitude. Perhaps a residence abroad would be\r\nbest for Lady Glencora at this particular period of her life. If\r\nso, abroad she should certainly live. Before resolving, however,\r\non anything permanently on this head, he thought that he might\r\njudiciously consult those six first-rate London physicians, whom, in\r\nthe first moment of his excitement, he had been desirous of summoning\r\nto Lucerne.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Alice had gone up to the bedroom of the lady who was\r\nnow to be the subject of so much anxious thought. When she entered\r\nthe room, her friend was up and in her dressing-gown, lying on a sofa\r\nwhich stood at the foot of the bed. "Oh, Alice, I\'m so glad you\'ve\r\ncome," said Lady Glencora. "I do so want to hear your voice." Then\r\nAlice knelt beside her, and asked her if she were ill.\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t told you? But of course he wouldn\'t. How could he? But,\r\nAlice, how did he look? Did you observe anything about him? Was he\r\npleased?"\r\n\r\n"I did observe something, and I think he was pleased. But what is it?\r\nHe called me Alice. And seemed to be quite unlike himself. But what\r\nis it? He told me that I was to come to you instantly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Alice, can\'t you guess?" Then suddenly Alice did guess the\r\nsecret, and whispered her guess into Lady Glencora\'s ear. "I suppose\r\nit is so," said Lady Glencora. "I know what they\'ll do. They\'ll\r\nkill me by fussing over me. If I could go about my work like a\r\nwasherwoman, I should be all right."\r\n\r\n"I am so happy," she said, some two or three hours afterwards. "I\r\nwon\'t deny that I am very happy. It seemed as though I were destined\r\nto bring nothing but misery to everybody, and I used to wish myself\r\ndead so often. I shan\'t wish myself dead now."\r\n\r\n"We shall all have to go home, I suppose?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"He says so;--but he seems to think that I oughtn\'t to travel above\r\na mile and a half a day. When I talked of going down the Rhine in\r\none of the steamers, I thought he would have gone into a fit. When I\r\nasked him why, he gave me such a look. I know he\'ll make a goose of\r\nhimself;--and he\'ll make geese of us, too; which is worse."\r\n\r\nOn that afternoon, as they were walking together, Mr. Palliser told\r\nthe important secret to his new friend, Mr. Grey. He could not deny\r\nhimself the pleasure of talking about this great event. "It is a\r\nmatter, you see, of such immense importance to me," Mr. Palliser said.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, it is," said Grey. "Every man feels that when a child\r\nis about to be born to him." But this did not at all satisfy Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he. "That\'s of course. It is an important thing to\r\neverybody;--very important, no doubt. But, when a man--. You see,\r\nGrey, I don\'t think a man is a bit better because he is rich, or\r\nbecause he has a title; nor do I think he is likely to be in any\r\ndegree the happier. I am quite sure that he has no right to be in the\r\nslightest degree proud of that which he has had no hand in doing for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Men usually are very proud of such advantages," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I am; I don\'t, indeed. I am proud of some things.\r\nWhenever I can manage to carry a point in the House, I feel very\r\nproud of it. I don\'t think I ever knocked under to any one, and I am\r\nproud of that." Perhaps, Mr. Palliser was thinking of a certain time\r\nwhen his uncle the Duke had threatened him, and he had not given way\r\nto the Duke\'s threats. "But I don\'t think I\'m proud because chance\r\nhas made me my uncle\'s heir."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, I should say."\r\n\r\n"But I do feel that a son to me is of more importance than it is\r\nto most men. A strong anxiety on the subject, is, I think, more\r\nexcusable in me than it might be in another. I don\'t know whether I\r\nquite make myself understood?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! When there\'s a dukedom and heaven knows how many thousands\r\na year to be disposed of, the question of their future ownership does\r\nbecome important."\r\n\r\n"This property is so much more interesting to one, if one feels that\r\nall one does to it is done for one\'s own son."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Grey, "of all the great plunderers of property\r\nthroughout Europe, the Popes have been the most greedy."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s different, when a man can\'t have a wife," said Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it may be seen that Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey had become\r\nvery intimate. Had chance brought them together in London they might\r\nhave met a score of times before Mr. Palliser would have thought\r\nof doing more than bowing to such an acquaintance. Mr. Grey might\r\nhave spent weeks at Matching, without having achieved anything like\r\nintimacy with its noble owner. But things of that kind progress more\r\nquickly abroad than they do at home. The deck of an ocean steamer is\r\nperhaps the most prolific hotbed of the growth of sudden friendships;\r\nbut an hotel by the side of a Swiss lake does almost as well.\r\n\r\nFor some time after this Lady Glencora\'s conduct was frequently so\r\nindiscreet as to drive her husband almost to frenzy. On the very day\r\nafter the news had been communicated to him, she proposed a picnic,\r\nand made the proposition not only in the presence of Alice, but in\r\nthat of Mr. Grey also! Mr. Palliser, on such an occasion, could not\r\nexpress all that he thought; but he looked it.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, now, Plantagenet?" said his wife.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said he;--"nothing. Never mind."\r\n\r\n"And shall we make this party up to the chapel?"\r\n\r\nThe chapel in question was Tell\'s chapel--ever so far up the lake. A\r\njourney in a steam-boat would have been necessary.\r\n\r\n"No!" said he, shouting out his refusal at her. "We will not."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be angry about it," said she;--as though he could have\r\nfailed to be stirred by such a proposition at such a time. On another\r\noccasion she returned from an evening walk, showing on her face some\r\nsign of the exercise she had taken.\r\n\r\n"Good G----! Glencora," said he, "do you mean to kill yourself?"\r\n\r\nHe wanted her to eat six or seven times a day; and always told her\r\nthat she was eating too much, remembering some ancient proverb about\r\nlittle and often. He watched her now as closely as Mrs. Marsham and\r\nMr. Bott had watched her before; and she always knew that he was doing\r\nso. She made the matter worse by continually proposing to do things\r\nwhich she knew he would not permit, in order that she might enjoy the\r\nfun of seeing his agony and amazement. But this, though it was fun to\r\nher at the moment, produced anything but fun, as its general result.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Alice, I think this will kill me," she said. "I am not\r\nto stir out of the house now, unless I go in the carriage, or he is\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t last long."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call long. As for walking with him, it\'s out\r\nof the question. He goes about a mile an hour. And then he makes me\r\nlook so much like a fool. I had no idea that he would be such an old\r\ncoddle."\r\n\r\n"The coddling will all be given to some one else, very soon."\r\n\r\n"No baby could possibly live through it, if you mean that. If there\r\nis a baby--"\r\n\r\n"I suppose there will be one, by-and-by," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool! But, if there is, I shall take that matter into\r\nmy own hands. He can do what he pleases with me, and I can\'t help\r\nmyself; but I shan\'t let him or anybody do what they please with my\r\nbaby. I know what I\'m about in such matters a great deal better than\r\nhe does. I\'ve no doubt he\'s a very clever man in Parliament; but he\r\ndoesn\'t seem to me to understand anything else."\r\n\r\nAlice was making some very wise speech in answer to this, when Lady\r\nGlencora interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Grey wouldn\'t make himself so troublesome, I\'m quite sure." Then\r\nAlice held her tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen the first consternation arising from the news had somewhat\r\nsubsided,--say in a fortnight from the day in which Mr. Palliser was\r\nmade so triumphant,--and when tidings had been duly sent to the Duke,\r\nand an answer from his Grace had come, arrangements were made for the\r\nreturn of the party to England. The Duke\'s reply was very short:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR PLANTAGENET,--Give my kind love to Glencora. If\r\n   it\'s a boy, of course I will be one of the godfathers.\r\n   The Prince, who is very kind, will perhaps oblige me by\r\n   being the other. I should advise you to return as soon as\r\n   convenient.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate uncle,\r\n\r\n   OMNIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the letter; and short as it was, it was probably the longest\r\nthat Mr. Palliser had ever received from the Duke.\r\n\r\nThere was great trouble about the mode of their return.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what nonsense," said Glencora. "Let us get into an express\r\ntrain, and go right through to London." Mr. Palliser looked at her\r\nwith a countenance full of rebuke and sorrow. He was always so\r\nlooking at her now. "If you mean, Plantagenet, that we are to be\r\ndragged all across the Continent in that horrible carriage, and be\r\na thousand days on the road, I for one won\'t submit to it." "I wish\r\nI had never told him a word about it," she said afterwards to Alice.\r\n"He would never have found it out himself, till this thing was all\r\nover."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser did at last consent to take the joint opinion of a Swiss\r\ndoctor and an English one who was settled at Berne; and who, on the\r\noccasion, was summoned to Lucerne. They suggested the railway; and as\r\nletters arrived for Mr. Palliser,--medical letters,--in which the same\r\nopinion was broached, it was agreed, at last, that they should return\r\nby railway; but they were to make various halts on the road, stopping\r\nat each halting-place for a day. The first was, of course, Basle, and\r\nfrom Basle they were to go on to Baden.\r\n\r\n"I particularly want to see Baden again," Lady Glencora said; "and\r\nperhaps I may be able to get back my napoleon."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nShowing What Happened in the Churchyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese arrangements as to the return of Mr. Palliser\'s party to London\r\ndid not, of course, include Mr. Grey. They were generally discussed in\r\nMr. Grey\'s absence, and communicated to him by Mr. Palliser. "I suppose\r\nwe shall see you in England before long?" said Mr. Palliser. "I shall\r\nbe able to tell you that before you go," said Grey. "Not but that in\r\nany event I shall return to England before the winter."\r\n\r\n"Then come to us at Matching," said Mr. Palliser. "We shall be most\r\nhappy to have you. Say that you\'ll come for the first fortnight\r\nin December. After that we always go to the Duke, in Barsetshire.\r\nThough, by-the-by, I don\'t suppose we shall go anywhere this year,"\r\nMr. Palliser added, interrupting the warmth of his invitation, and\r\nreflecting that, under the present circumstances, perhaps, it might\r\nbe improper to have any guests at Matching in December. But he had\r\nbecome very fond of Mr. Grey, and on this occasion, as he had done on\r\nsome others, pressed him warmly to make an attempt at Parliament. "It\r\nisn\'t nearly so difficult as you think," said he, when Grey declared\r\nthat he would not know where to look for a seat. "See the men that\r\nget in. There was Mr. Vavasor. Even he got a seat."\r\n\r\n"But he had to pay for it very dearly."\r\n\r\n"You might easily find some quiet little borough."\r\n\r\n"Quiet little boroughs have usually got their own quiet little\r\nMembers," said Grey.\r\n\r\n"They\'re fond of change; and if you like to spend a thousand pounds,\r\nthe thing isn\'t difficult. I\'ll put you in the way of it." But Mr.\r\nGrey still declined. He was not a man prone to be talked out of his\r\nown way of life, and the very fact that George Vavasor had been in\r\nParliament would of itself have gone far towards preventing any\r\nattempt on his part in that direction. Alice had also wanted him to\r\ngo into public life, but he had put aside her request as though the\r\nthing were quite out of the question,--never giving a moment to its\r\nconsideration. Had she asked him to settle himself and her in Central\r\nAfrica, his manner and mode of refusal would have been the same. It\r\nwas this immobility on his part,--this absolute want of any of the\r\nweakness of indecision, which had frightened her, and driven her away\r\nfrom him. He was partly aware of this; but that which he had declined\r\nto do at her solicitation, he certainly would not do at the advice\r\nof any one else. So it was that he argued the matter with himself.\r\nHad he now allowed himself to be so counselled, with what terrible\r\nacknowledgements of his own faults must he not have presented himself\r\nbefore Alice?\r\n\r\n"I suppose books, then, will be your object in life?" said Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n"I hope they will be my aids," Grey answered. "I almost doubt whether\r\nany object such as that you mean is necessary for life, or even\r\nexpedient. It seems to me that if a man can so train himself that he\r\nmay live honestly and die fearlessly, he has done about as much as is\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n"He has done a great deal, certainly," said Mr. Palliser, who was\r\nnot ready enough to carry on the argument as he might have done had\r\nmore time been given to him to consider it. He knew very well that\r\nhe himself was working for others, and not for himself; and he was\r\naware, though he had not analysed his own convictions on the matter,\r\nthat good men struggle as they do in order that others, besides\r\nthemselves, may live honestly, and, if possible, die fearlessly. The\r\nrecluse of Nethercoats had thought much more about all this than the\r\nrising star of the House of Commons; but the philosophy of the rising\r\nstar was the better philosophy of the two, though he was by far the\r\nless brilliant man. "I don\'t see why a man should not live honestly\r\nand be a Member of Parliament as well," continued Mr. Palliser, when\r\nhe had been silent for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Nor I either," said Grey. "I am sure that there are such men, and\r\nthat the country is under great obligation to them. But they are\r\nsubject to temptations which a prudent man like myself may perhaps\r\ndo well to avoid." But though he spoke with an assured tone, he was\r\nshaken, and almost regretted that he did not accept the aid which was\r\noffered to him. It is astonishing how strong a man may be to those\r\naround him,--how impregnable may be his exterior, while within he\r\nfeels himself to be as weak as water, and as unstable as chaff.\r\n\r\nBut the object which he had now in view was a renewal of his\r\nengagement with Alice, and he felt that he must obtain an answer from\r\nher before they left Lucerne. If she still persisted in refusing to\r\ngive him her hand, it would not be consistent with his dignity as\r\na man to continue his immediate pursuit of her any longer. In such\r\ncase he must leave her, and see what future time might bring forth.\r\nHe believed himself to be aware that he would never offer his love\r\nto another woman; and if Alice were to remain single, he might try\r\nagain, after the lapse of a year or two. But if he failed now,--then,\r\nfor that year or two, he would see her no more. Having so resolved,\r\nand being averse to anything like a surprise, he asked her, as\r\nhe left her one evening, whether she would walk with him on the\r\nfollowing morning. That morning would be the morning of her last day\r\nat Lucerne; and as she assented she knew well what was to come. She\r\nsaid nothing to Lady Glencora on the subject, but allowed the coming\r\nprospects of the Palliser family to form the sole subject of their\r\nconversation that night, as it had done on every night since the\r\ngreat news had become known. They were always together for an hour\r\nevery evening before Alice was allowed to go to bed, and during\r\nthis hour the anxieties of the future father and mother were always\r\ndiscussed till Alice Vavasor was almost tired of them. But she was\r\npatient with her friend, and on this special night she was patient\r\nas ever. But when she was released and was alone, she made a great\r\nendeavour to come to some fixed resolution as to what she would do on\r\nthe morrow,--some resolution which should be absolutely resolute, and\r\nfrom which no eloquence on the part of any one should move her. But\r\nsuch resolutions are not easily reached, and Alice laboured through\r\nhalf the night almost in vain. She knew that she loved the man. She\r\nknew that he was as true to her as the sun is true to the earth. She\r\nknew that she would be, in all respects, safe in his hands. She knew\r\nthat Lady Glencora would be delighted, and her father gratified. She\r\nknew that the countesses would open their arms to her,--though I\r\ndoubt whether this knowledge was in itself very persuasive. She knew\r\nthat by such a marriage she would gain all that women generally look\r\nto gain when they give themselves away. But, nevertheless, as far as\r\nshe could decide at all, she decided against her lover. She had no\r\nright of her own to be taken back after the evil that she had done,\r\nand she did not choose to be taken back as an object of pity and\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" said her cousin, when she came in with her hat\r\non, soon after breakfast.\r\n\r\n"I am going to walk,--with Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"By appointment?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, by appointment. He asked me yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s all settled, and you haven\'t told me!"\r\n\r\n"All that is settled I have told you very often. He asked me\r\nyesterday to walk with him this morning, and I could not well refuse\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Why should you have wished to refuse him?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said that I did wish it. But I hate scenes, and I think it\r\nwould have been pleasanter for us to have parted without any occasion\r\nfor special words."\r\n\r\n"Alice, you are such a fool!"\r\n\r\n"So you tell me very often."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is now going to say the very thing that he has come\r\nall this way for the purpose of saying. He has been wonderfully slow\r\nabout it; but then slow as he is, you are slower. If you don\'t make\r\nit up with him now, I really shall think you are very wicked. I am\r\nbecoming like Lady Midlothian;--I can\'t understand it. I know you\r\nwant to be his wife, and I know he wants to be your husband, and the\r\nonly thing that keeps you apart is your obstinacy,--just because you\r\nhave said you wouldn\'t have him. My belief is that if Lady Midlothian\r\nand the rest of us were to pat you on the back, and tell you how\r\nright you were, you\'d ask him to take you, out of defiance. You may\r\nbe sure of this, Alice; if you refuse him now, it\'ll be for the last\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nThis, and much more of the same kind, she bore before Mr. Grey came\r\nto take her, and she answered to it all as little as she could. "You\r\nare making me very unhappy, Glencora," she said once. "I wish I could\r\nbreak you down with unhappiness," Lady Glencora answered, "so that he\r\nmight find you less stiff, and hard, and unmanageable." Directly upon\r\nthat he came in, looking as though he had no business on hand more\r\nexciting than his ordinary morning\'s tranquil employments. Alice at\r\nonce got up to start with him. "So you and Alice are going to make\r\nyour adieux," said Lady Glencora. "It must be done sooner or later,"\r\nsaid Mr. Grey; and then they went off.\r\n\r\nThose who know Lucerne,--and almost everybody now does know\r\nLucerne,--will remember the big hotel which has been built close to\r\nthe landing-pier of the steamers, and will remember also the church\r\nthat stands upon a little hill or rising ground, to the left of you,\r\nas you come out of the inn upon the lake. The church is immediately\r\nover the lake, and round the church there is a burying-ground,\r\nand skirting the burying-ground there are cloisters, through the\r\narches and apertures of which they who walk and sit there look down\r\nimmediately upon the blue water, and across the water upon the\r\nfrowning menaces of Mount Pilate. It is one of the prettiest spots in\r\nthat land of beauty; and its charm is to my feeling enhanced by the\r\nsepulchral monuments over which I walk, and by which I am surrounded,\r\nas I stand there. Up here, into these cloisters, Alice and John Grey\r\nwent together. I doubt whether he had formed any purpose of doing\r\nso. She certainly would have gone without question in any direction\r\nthat he might have led her. The distance from the inn up to the\r\nchurch-gate did not take them ten minutes, and when they were there\r\ntheir walk was over. But the place was solitary, and they were alone;\r\nand it might be as well for Mr. Grey to speak what words he had to say\r\nthere as elsewhere. They had often been together in those cloisters\r\nbefore, but on such occasions either Mr. Palliser or Lady Glencora\r\nhad been with them. On their slow passage up the hill very little was\r\nspoken, and that little was of no moment. "We will go in here for a\r\nfew minutes," he said. "It is the prettiest spot about Lucerne, and\r\nwe don\'t know when we may see it again." So they went in, and sat\r\ndown on one of the embrasures that open from the cloisters over the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n"Probably never again," said Alice. "And yet I have been here now two\r\nyears running."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered as she remembered that in that former year George\r\nVavasor had been with her. As she thought of it all she hated\r\nherself. Over and over again she had told herself that she had so\r\nmismanaged the latter years of her life that it was impossible for\r\nher not to hate herself. No woman had a clearer idea of feminine\r\nconstancy than she had, and no woman had sinned against that idea\r\nmore deeply. He gave her time to think of all this as he sat there\r\nlooking down upon the water.\r\n\r\n"And yet I would sooner live in Cambridgeshire," were the first words\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Partly because all beauty is best enjoyed when it is sought for with\r\nsome trouble and difficulty, and partly because such beauty, and the\r\nromance which is attached to it, should not make up the staple of\r\none\'s life. Romance, if it is to come at all, should always come by\r\nfits and starts."\r\n\r\n"I should like to live in a pretty country."\r\n\r\n"And would like to live a romantic life,--no doubt; but all those\r\nthings lose their charm if they are made common. When a man has to\r\ngo to Vienna or St. Petersburg two or three times a month, you don\'t\r\nsuppose he enjoys travelling?"\r\n\r\n"All the same, I should like to live in a pretty country," said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n"And I want you to come and live in a very ugly country." Then he\r\npaused for a minute or two, not looking at her, but gazing still on\r\nthe mountain opposite. She did not speak a word, but looked as he was\r\nlooking. She knew that the request was coming, and had been thinking\r\nabout it all night; but now that it had come she did not know how to\r\nbear herself. "I don\'t think," he went on to say, "that you would let\r\nthat consideration stand in your way, if on other grounds you were\r\nwilling to become my wife."\r\n\r\n"What consideration?"\r\n\r\n"Because Nethercoats is not so pretty as Lucerne."\r\n\r\n"It would have nothing to do with it," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"It should have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing; nothing at all," repeated Alice.\r\n\r\n"Will you come, then? Will you come and be my wife, and help me to be\r\nhappy amidst all that ugliness? Will you come and be my one beautiful\r\nthing, my treasure, my joy, my comfort, my counsellor?"\r\n\r\n"You want no counsellor, Mr. Grey."\r\n\r\n"No man ever wanted one more. Alice, this has been a bad year to me,\r\nand I do not think that it has been a happy one for you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no."\r\n\r\n"Let us forget it,--or rather, let us treat it as though it were\r\nforgotten. Twelve months ago you were mine. You were, at any rate,\r\nso much mine that I had a right to boast of my possession among my\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"It was a poor boast."\r\n\r\n"They did not seem to think so. I had but one or two to whom I could\r\nspeak of you, but they told me that I was going to be a happy man.\r\nAs to myself, I was sure that I was to be so. No man was ever better\r\ncontented with his bargain than I was with mine. Let us go back to\r\nit, and the last twelve months shall be as though they had never\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"That cannot be, Mr. Grey. If it could, I should be worse even than\r\nI am."\r\n\r\n"Why cannot it be?"\r\n\r\n"Because I cannot forgive myself what I have done, and because you\r\nought not to forgive me."\r\n\r\n"But I do. There has never been an hour with me in which there has\r\nbeen an offence of yours rankling in my bosom unforgiven. I think you\r\nhave been foolish, misguided,--led away by a vain ambition, and that\r\nin the difficulty to which these things brought you, you endeavoured\r\nto constrain yourself to do an act, which, when it came near to\r\nyou,--when the doing of it had to be more closely considered, you\r\nfound to be contrary to your nature." Now, as he spoke thus, she\r\nturned her eyes upon him, and looked at him, wondering that he should\r\nhave had power to read her heart so accurately. "I never believed\r\nthat you would marry your cousin. When I was told of it, I knew that\r\ntrouble had blinded you for awhile. You had driven yourself to revolt\r\nagainst me, and upon that your heart misgave you, and you said to\r\nyourself that it did not matter then how you might throw away all\r\nyour sweetness. You see that I speak of your old love for me with the\r\nfrank conceit of a happy lover."\r\n\r\n"No;--no, no!" she ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"But the storm passes over the tree and does not tear it up by\r\nthe roots or spoil it of all its symmetry. When we hear the winds\r\nblowing, and see how the poor thing is shaken, we think that its\r\ndays are numbered and its destruction at hand. Alice, when the\r\nwinds were shaking you, and you were torn and buffeted, I never\r\nthought so. There may be some who will forgive you slowly. Your own\r\nself-forgiveness will be slow. But I, who have known you better than\r\nany one,--yes, better than any one,--I have forgiven you everything,\r\nhave forgiven you instantly. Come to me, Alice, and comfort me. Come\r\nto me, for I want you sorely." She sat quite still, looking at the\r\nlake and the mountain beyond, but she said nothing. What could she\r\nsay to him? "My need of you is much greater now," he went on to say,\r\n"than when I first asked you to share the world with me. Then I could\r\nhave borne to lose you, as I had never boasted to myself that you\r\nwere my own,--had never pictured to myself the life that might be\r\nmine if you were always to be with me. But since that day I have had\r\nno other hope,--no other hope but this for which I plead now. Am I to\r\nplead in vain?"\r\n\r\n"You do not know me," she said; "how vile I have been! You do not\r\nthink what it is,--for a woman to have promised herself to one man\r\nwhile she loved another."\r\n\r\n"But it was me you loved. Ah! Alice, I can forgive that. Do I not\r\ntell you that I did forgive it the moment that I heard it? Do you not\r\nhear me say that I never for a moment thought that you would marry\r\nhim? Alice, you should scold me for my vanity, for I have believed\r\nall through that you loved me, and me only. Come to me, dear, and\r\ntell me that it is so, and the past shall be only as a dream."\r\n\r\n"I am dreaming it always," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"They will cease to be bitter dreams if your head be upon my\r\nshoulder. You will cease to reproach yourself when you know that you\r\nhave made me happy."\r\n\r\n"I shall never cease to reproach myself. I have done that which no\r\nwoman can do and honour herself afterwards. I have been--a jilt."\r\n\r\n"The noblest jilt that ever yet halted between two minds! There has\r\nbeen no touch of selfishness in your fickleness. I think I could be\r\nhard enough upon a woman who had left me for greater wealth, for a\r\nhigher rank,--who had left me even that she might be gay and merry.\r\nIt has not been so with you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it has. I thought you were too firm in your own will, and--"\r\n\r\n"And you think so still. Is that it?"\r\n\r\n"It does not matter what I think now. I am a fallen creature, and\r\nhave no longer a right to such thoughts. It will be better for us\r\nboth that you should leave me,--and forget me. There are things\r\nwhich, if a woman does them, should never be forgotten;--which she\r\nshould never permit herself to forget."\r\n\r\n"And am I to be punished, then, because of your fault? Is that your\r\nsense of justice?" He got up, and standing before her, looked down\r\nupon her. "Alice, if you will tell me that you do not love me, I will\r\nbelieve you, and will trouble you no more. I know that you will say\r\nnothing to me that is false. Through it all you have spoken no word\r\nof falsehood. If you love me, after what has passed, I have a right\r\nto demand your hand. My happiness requires it, and I have a right\r\nto expect your compliance. I do demand it. If you love me, Alice,\r\nI tell you that you dare not refuse me. If you do so, you will fail\r\nhereafter to reconcile it to your conscience before God."\r\n\r\nThen he stopped his speech, and waited for a reply; but Alice sat\r\nsilent beneath his gaze, with her eyes turned upon the tombstones\r\nbeneath her feet. Of course she had no choice but to yield. He,\r\npossessed of power and force infinitely greater than hers, had left\r\nher no alternative but to be happy. But there still clung to her what\r\nI fear we must call a perverseness of obstinacy, a desire to maintain\r\nthe resolution she had made,--a wish that she might be allowed to\r\nundergo the punishment she had deserved. She was as a prisoner who\r\nwould fain cling to his prison after pardon has reached him, because\r\nhe is conscious that the pardon is undeserved. And it may be that\r\nthere was still left within her bosom some remnant of that feeling\r\nof rebellion which his masterful spirit had ever produced in her. He\r\nwas so imperious in his tranquillity, he argued his question of love\r\nwith such a manifest preponderance of right on his side, that she had\r\nalways felt that to yield to him would be to confess the omnipotence\r\nof his power. She knew now that she must yield to him,--that his\r\npower over her was omnipotent. She was pressed by him as in some\r\ncountries the prisoner is pressed by the judge,--so pressed that she\r\nacknowledged to herself silently that any further antagonism to him\r\nwas impossible. Nevertheless, the word which she had to speak still\r\nremained unspoken, and he stood over her, waiting for her answer.\r\nThen slowly he sat down beside her, and gradually he put his arm\r\nround her waist. She shrank from him, back against the stonework of\r\nthe embrasure, but she could not shrink away from his grasp. She put\r\nup her hand to impede his, but his hand, like his character and his\r\nwords, was full of power. It would not be impeded. "Alice," he said,\r\nas he pressed her close with his arm, "the battle is over now, and I\r\nhave won it."\r\n\r\n"You win everything,--always," she said, whispering to him, as she\r\nstill shrank from his embrace.\r\n\r\n"In winning you I have won everything." Then he put his face over her\r\nand pressed his lips to hers. I wonder whether he was made happier\r\nwhen he knew that no other touch had profaned those lips since last\r\nhe had pressed them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nRouge et Noir.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice insisted on being left up in the churchyard, urging that she\r\nwanted to "think about it all," but, in truth, fearing that she might\r\nnot be able to carry herself well, if she were to walk down with her\r\nlover to the hotel. To this he made no objection, and, on reaching\r\nthe inn, met Mr. Palliser in the hall. Mr. Palliser was already\r\ninspecting the arrangement of certain large trunks which had been\r\nbrought down-stairs, and was preparing for their departure. He was\r\ngoing about the house, with a nervous solicitude to do something,\r\nand was flattering himself that he was of use. As he could not\r\nbe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as, by the nature of his\r\ndisposition, some employment was necessary to him, he was looking to\r\nthe cording of the boxes. "Good morning! good morning!" he said to\r\nGrey, hardly looking at him, as though time were too precious with\r\nhim to allow of his turning his eyes upon his friend. "I am going up\r\nto the station to see after a carriage for to-morrow. Perhaps you\'ll\r\ncome with me." To this proposition Mr. Grey assented. "Sometimes, you\r\nknow," continued Mr. Palliser, "the springs of the carriages are so\r\nvery rough." Then, in a very few words, Mr. Grey told him what had\r\nbeen his own morning\'s work. He hated secrets and secrecy, and as the\r\nPallisers knew well what had brought him upon their track, it was,\r\nhe thought, well that they should know that he had been successful.\r\nMr. Palliser congratulated him very cordially, and then, running\r\nup-stairs for his gloves or his stick, or, more probably, that he\r\nmight give his wife one other caution as to her care of herself, he\r\ntold her also that Alice had yielded at last. "Of course she has,"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I really didn\'t think she would," said he.\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you don\'t understand things of that sort," said\r\nhis wife. Then the caution was repeated, the mother of the future\r\nduke was kissed, and Mr. Palliser went off on his mission about the\r\ncarriage, its cushions, and its springs. In the course of their walk\r\nMr. Palliser suggested that, as things were settled so pleasantly,\r\nMr. Grey might as well return with them to England, and to this\r\nsuggestion Mr. Grey assented.\r\n\r\nAlice remained alone for nearly an hour, looking out upon the rough\r\nsides and gloomy top of Mount Pilate. No one disturbed her in the\r\nchurchyard,--no steps were heard along the tombstones,--no voice\r\nsounded through the cloisters. She was left in perfect solitude to\r\nthink of the past, and form her plans of the future. Was she happy,\r\nnow that the manner of her life to come was thus settled for her;\r\nthat all further question as to the disposal of herself was taken\r\nout of her hands, and that her marriage with a man she loved was so\r\nfirmly arranged that no further folly of her own could disarrange\r\nit? She was happy, though she was slow to confess her happiness to\r\nherself. She was happy, and she was resolute in this,--that she would\r\nnow do all she could to make him happy also. And there must now,\r\nshe acknowledged, be an end to her pride,--to that pride which had\r\nhitherto taught her to think that she could more wisely follow her\r\nown guidance than that of any other who might claim to guide her. She\r\nknew now that she must follow his guidance. She had found her master,\r\nas we sometimes say, and laughed to herself with a little inward\r\nlaughter as she confessed that it was so. She was from henceforth\r\naltogether in his hands. If he chose to tell her that they were to be\r\nmarried at Michaelmas, or at Christmas, or on Lady Day, they would,\r\nof course, be married accordingly. She had taken her fling at having\r\nher own will, and she and all her friends had seen what had come of\r\nit. She had assumed the command of the ship, and had thrown it upon\r\nthe rocks, and she felt that she never ought to take the captain\'s\r\nplace again. It was well for her that he who was to be captain was\r\none whom she respected as thoroughly as she loved him.\r\n\r\nShe would write to her father at once,--to her father and Lady\r\nMacleod,--and would confess everything. She felt that she owed it to\r\nthem that they should be told by herself that they had been right and\r\nthat she had been wrong. Hitherto she had not mentioned to either of\r\nthem the fact that Mr. Grey was with them in Switzerland. And, then,\r\nwhat must she do as to Lady Midlothian? As to Lady Midlothian, she\r\nwould do nothing. Lady Midlothian, of course, would triumph;--would\r\njump upon her, as Lady Glencora had once expressed it, with very\r\ntriumphant heels,--would try to patronize her, or, which would be\r\nalmost worse, would make a parade of her forgiveness. But she would\r\nhave nothing to do with Lady Midlothian, unless, indeed, Mr. Grey\r\nshould order it. Then she laughed at herself again with that inward\r\nlaughter, and, rising from her seat, proceeded to walk down the hill\r\nto the hotel.\r\n\r\n"Vanquished at last!" said Lady Glencora, as Alice entered the room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, vanquished; if you like to call it so," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"It is not what I call it, but what you feel it," said the other.\r\n"Do you think that I don\'t know you well enough to be sure that you\r\nregard yourself now as an unfortunate prisoner,--as a captive taken\r\nin war, to be led away in triumph, without any hope of a ransom? I\r\nknow that it is quite a misery to you that you should be made a happy\r\nwoman of at last. I understand it all, my dear, and my heart bleeds\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n"Of course; I knew that was the way you would treat me."\r\n\r\n"In what way would you have me treat you? If I were to hug you with\r\njoy, and tell you how good he is, and how fortunate you are,--if I\r\nwere to praise him, and bid you triumph in your success, as might be\r\nexpected on such an occasion,--you would put on a long face at once,\r\nand tell me that though the thing is to be, it would be much better\r\nthat the thing shouldn\'t be. Don\'t I know you, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have said that;--not now."\r\n\r\n"I believe in my heart you would;--that, or something like it. But I\r\ndo wish you joy all the same, and you may say what you please. He has\r\ngot you in his power now, and I don\'t think even you can go back."\r\n\r\n"No; I shall not go back again."\r\n\r\n"I would join with Lady Midlothian in putting you into a madhouse,\r\nif you did. But I am so glad; I am, indeed. I was afraid to the\r\nlast,--terribly afraid; you are so hard and so proud. I don\'t mean\r\nhard to me, dear. You have never been half hard enough to me. But you\r\nare hard to yourself, and, upon my word, you have been hard to him.\r\nWhat a deal you will have to make up to him!"\r\n\r\n"I feel that I ought to stand before him always as a penitent,--in a\r\nwhite sheet."\r\n\r\n"He will like it better, I dare say, if you will sit upon his knee.\r\nSome penitents do, you know. And how happy you will be! He\'ll never\r\nexplain the sugar-duties to you, and there\'ll be no Mr. Bott at\r\nNethercoats." They sat together the whole morning,--while Mr. Palliser\r\nwas seeing to the springs and cushions,--and by degrees Alice began\r\nto enjoy her happiness. As she did so her friend enjoyed it with her,\r\nand at last they had something of the comfort and excitement which\r\nsuch an occasion should give. "I\'ll tell you what, Alice; you shall\r\ncome and be married at Matching, in August, or perhaps September.\r\nThat\'s the only way in which I can be present; and if we can bespeak\r\nsome sun, we\'ll have the breakfast out in the ruins."\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they all started together, a first-class\r\ncompartment having been taken for the Palliser family, and a\r\nsecond-class compartment close to them for the Palliser servants. Mr.\r\nPalliser, as he slowly handed his wife in, was a triumphant man; as\r\nwas also Mr. Grey, as he handed in his lady-love, though, in a manner,\r\nmuch less manifest. We may say that both the gentlemen had been\r\nvery fortunate while at Lucerne. Mr. Palliser had come abroad with a\r\nfeeling that all the world had been cut from under his feet. A great\r\nchange was needed for his wife, and he had acknowledged at once that\r\neverything must be made to yield to that necessity. He certainly\r\nhad his reward,--now in his triumphant return. Terrible troubles\r\nhad afflicted him as he went, which seemed now to have dissipated\r\nthemselves altogether. When he thought of Burgo Fitzgerald he\r\nremembered him only as a poor, unfortunate fellow, for whom he should\r\nbe glad to do something, if the doing of anything were only in his\r\npower; and he had in his pocket a letter which he had that morning\r\nreceived from the Duke of St. Bungay, marked private and confidential,\r\nwhich was in its nature very private and confidential, and in which\r\nhe was told that Lord Brock and Mr. Finespun were totally at variance\r\nabout French wines. Mr. Finespun wanted to do something, now in the\r\nrecess,--to send some political agent over to France,--to which Lord\r\nBrock would not agree; and no one knew what would be the consequence\r\nof this disagreement. Here might be another chance,--if only Mr.\r\nPalliser could give up his winter in Italy! Mr. Palliser, as he took\r\nhis place opposite his wife, was very triumphant.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Grey was triumphant, as he placed himself gently in his seat\r\nopposite to Alice. He seemed to assume no right, as he took that\r\nposition apparently because it was the one which came naturally to\r\nhis lot. No one would have been made aware that Alice was his own\r\nsimply by seeing his arrangements for her comfort. He made no loud\r\nassertion as to his property and his rights, as some men do. He was\r\nquiet and subdued in his joy, but not the less was he triumphant.\r\nFrom the day on which Alice had accepted his first offer,--nay, from\r\nan earlier day than that; from the day on which he had first resolved\r\nto make it, down to the present hour, he had never been stirred from\r\nhis purpose. By every word that he had said, and by every act that he\r\nhad done, he had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their\r\njoint lives, which Alice\'s other friends had regarded as so fatal.\r\nWhen she first rejected him, he would not take his rejection. When\r\nshe told him that she intended to marry her cousin, he silently\r\ndeclined to believe that such marriage would ever take place. He had\r\nnever given her up for a day, and now the event proved that he had\r\nbeen right. Alice was happy, very happy; but she was still disposed\r\nto regard her lover as Fate, and her happiness as an enforced\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThey stopped a night at Basle, and again she stood upon the balcony.\r\nHe was close to her as she stood there,--so close that, putting out\r\nher hand for his, she was able to take it and press it closely. "You\r\nare thinking of something, Alice," he said. "What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It was here," she said--"here, on this very balcony, that I first\r\nrebelled against you, and now you have brought me here that I should\r\nconfess and submit on the same spot. I do confess. How am I to thank\r\nyou for forgiving me?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "How am I to thank you for forgiving me?"]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they went on to Baden-Baden, and there they\r\nstopped for a couple of days. Lady Glencora had positively refused\r\nto stop a day at Basle, making so many objections to the place that\r\nher husband had at last yielded. "I could go from Vienna to London\r\nwithout feeling it," she said, with indignation; "and to tell me that\r\nI can\'t do two easy days\' journey running!" Mr. Palliser had been\r\nafraid to be imperious, and therefore, immediately on his arrival at\r\none of the stations in Basle, he had posted across the town, in the\r\nheat and the dust, to look after the cushions and the springs at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a particular favour to ask of you," Lady Glencora said to\r\nher husband, as soon as they were alone together in their rooms at\r\nBaden. Mr. Palliser declared that he would grant her any particular\r\nfavour,--only premising that he was not to be supposed to have\r\nthereby committed himself to any engagement under which his wife\r\nshould have authority to take any exertion upon herself. "I wish I\r\nwere a milkmaid," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"But you are not a milkmaid, my dear. You haven\'t been brought up\r\nlike a milkmaid."\r\n\r\nBut what was the favour? If she would only ask for jewels,--though\r\nthey were the Grand Duchess\'s diamond eardrops, he would endeavour\r\nto get them for her. If she would have quaffed molten pearls, like\r\nCleopatra, he would have procured the beverage,--having first\r\nfortified himself with a medical opinion as to the fitness of the\r\ndrink for a lady in her condition. There was no expenditure that\r\nhe would not willingly incur for her, nothing costly that he would\r\ngrudge. But when she asked for a favour, he was always afraid of an\r\nimprudence. Very possibly she might want to drink beer in an open\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAnd her request was, at last, of this nature: "I want you to take me\r\nup to the gambling-rooms!" said she.\r\n\r\n"The gambling-rooms!" said Mr. Palliser in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Plantagenet; the gambling-rooms. If you had been with me\r\nbefore, I should not have made a fool of myself by putting my piece\r\nof money on the table. I want to see the place; but then I saw\r\nnothing, because I was so frightened when I found that I was\r\nwinning."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser was aware that all the world of Baden,--or rather the\r\nworld of the strangers at Baden,--assembles itself in those salons.\r\nIt may be also that he himself was curious to see how men looked\r\nwhen they lost their own money, or won that of others. He knew how a\r\nMinister looked when he lost or gained a tax. He was familiar with\r\nmillions and tens of millions in a committee of the whole House. He\r\nknew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates. But he\r\nhad never yet seen a poor man stake his last napoleon, and rake back\r\nfrom off the table a small hatful of gold. A little exercise after an\r\nearly dinner was, he had been told, good for his wife; and he agreed\r\ntherefore that, on their second evening at Baden, they would all walk\r\nup and see the play.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall get back my napoleon," said Glencora to Alice.\r\n\r\n"And perhaps I shall be forgiven when somebody sees how difficult it\r\nis to manage you," said Alice, looking at Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t in earnest," said Mr. Palliser, almost fearing the result\r\nof the experiment.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nThey started together, Mr. Palliser with his wife, and Mr. Grey with\r\nAlice on his arm, and found all the tables at work. They at first\r\nwalked through the different rooms, whispering to each other their\r\ncomments on the people that they saw, and listening to the quick,\r\nlow, monotonous words of the croupiers as they arranged and presided\r\nover the games. Each table was closely surrounded by its own crowd,\r\nmade up of players, embryo players, and simple lookers-on, so that\r\nthey could not see much as they walked. But this was not enough for\r\nLady Glencora. She was anxious to know what these men and women were\r\ndoing,--to see whether the croupiers wore horns on their heads and\r\nwere devils indeed,--to behold the faces of those who were wretched\r\nand of those who were triumphant,--to know how the thing was\r\ndone, and to learn something of that lesson in life. "Let us stand\r\nhere a moment," she said to her husband, arresting him at one corner\r\nof the table which had the greatest crowd. "We shall be able to see\r\nin a few minutes." So he stood with her there, giving way to Alice,\r\nwho went in front with his wife; and in a minute or two an aperture\r\nwas made, so that they could all see the marked cloth, and the money\r\nlying about, and the rakes on the table, and the croupier skilfully\r\ndealing his cards, and,--more interesting than all the rest, the\r\nfaces of those who were playing. Grey looked on, over Alice\'s\r\nshoulder, very attentively,--as did Palliser also,--but both of them\r\nkept their eyes upon the ministers of the work. Alice and Glencora\r\ndid the same at first, but as they gained courage they glanced round\r\nupon the gamblers.\r\n\r\nIt was a long table, having, of course, four corners, and at the\r\ncorner appropriated by them they were partly opposite to the man who\r\ndealt the cards. The corner answering to theirs at the other end was\r\nthe part of the table most removed from their sight, and that on\r\nwhich their eyes fell last. As Lady Glencora stood she could hardly\r\nsee,--indeed, at first she could not see,--one or two who were\r\ncongregated at this spot. Mr. Palliser, who was behind her, could not\r\nsee them at all. But to Alice,--and to Mr. Grey, had he cared about\r\nit,--every face at the table was visible except the faces of those\r\nwho were immediately close to them. Before long Alice\'s attention\r\nwas riveted on the action and countenance of one young man who sat\r\nat that other corner. He was leaning, at first listlessly, over the\r\ntable, dressed in a velveteen jacket, and with his round-topped hat\r\nbrought far over his eyes, so that she could not fully see his face.\r\nBut she had hardly begun to observe him before he threw back his\r\nhat, and taking some pieces of gold from under his left hand, which\r\nlay upon the table, pushed three or four of them on to one of the\r\ndivisions marked on the cloth. He seemed to show no care, as others\r\ndid, as to the special spot which they should occupy. Many were very\r\nparticular in this respect, placing their ventures on the lines, so\r\nas to share the fortunes of two compartments, or sometimes of four;\r\nor they divided their coins, taking three or four numbers, selecting\r\nthe numbers with almost grotesque attention to some imagined rule of\r\ntheir own. But this man let his gold go all together, and left it\r\nwhere his half-stretched rake deposited it by chance. Alice could\r\nnot but look at his face. His eyes she could see were bloodshot, and\r\nhis hair, when he pushed back his hat, was rough and dishevelled;\r\nbut still there was that in his face which no woman could see and\r\nnot regard. It was a face which at once prepossessed her in his\r\nfavour,--as it had always prepossessed all others. On this occasion\r\nhe had won his money, and Alice saw him drag it in as lazily as he\r\nhad pushed it out.\r\n\r\n"Do you see that little Frenchman?" said Lady Glencora. "He has\r\njust made half a napoleon, and has walked off with it. Isn\'t it\r\ninteresting? I could stay here all the night." Then she turned round\r\nto whisper something to her husband, and Alice\'s eyes again fell on\r\nthe face of the man at the other end of the table. After he had won\r\nhis money, he had allowed the game to go on for a turn without any\r\naction on his part. The gold again went under his hand, and he\r\nlounged forward with his hat over his eyes. One of the croupiers had\r\nsaid a word, as though calling his attention to the game, but he\r\nhad merely shaken his head. But when the fate of the next turn had\r\nbeen decided, he again roused himself, and on this occasion, as far\r\nas Alice could see, pushed his whole stock forward with the rake.\r\nThere was a little mass of gold, and, from his manner of placing it,\r\nall might see that he left its position to chance. One piece had\r\ngot beyond its boundary, and the croupier pushed it back with some\r\nhalf-expressed inquiry as to his correctness. "All right," said a\r\nvoice in English. Then Lady Glencora started and clutched Alice\'s arm\r\nwith her hand. Mr. Palliser was explaining to Mr. Grey, behind them,\r\nsomething about German finance as connected with gambling-tables, and\r\ndid not hear the voice, or see his wife\'s motion. I need hardly tell\r\nthe reader that the gambler was Burgo Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Glencora said not a word,--not as yet. She looked forward\r\nvery gently, but still with eager eyes, till she could just see\r\nthe face she knew so well. His hat was now pushed back, and his\r\ncountenance had lost its listlessness. He watched narrowly the face\r\nof the man as he told out the amount of the cards as they were dealt.\r\nHe did not try to hide his anxiety, and when, after the telling of\r\nsome six or seven cards, he heard a certain number named, and a\r\ncertain colour called, he made some exclamation which even Glencora\r\ncould not hear. And then another croupier put down, close to Burgo\'s\r\nmoney, certain rolls of gold done up in paper, and also certain loose\r\nnapoleons.\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t he take it?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"He is taking it," said Alice, not at all knowing the cause of her\r\ncousin\'s anxiety.\r\n\r\nBurgo had paused a moment, and then prepared to rake the money to\r\nhim; but as he did so, he changed his mind, and pushed it all back\r\nagain,--now, on this occasion, being very careful to place it on its\r\nformer spot. Both Alice and Glencora could see that a man at his\r\nelbow was dissuading him,--had even attempted to stop the arm which\r\nheld the rake. But Burgo shook him off, speaking to him some word\r\nroughly, and then again he steadied the rolls upon their appointed\r\nplace. The croupier who had paused for a moment now went on quickly\r\nwith his cards, and in two minutes the fate of Burgo\'s wealth was\r\ndecided. It was all drawn back by the croupier\'s unimpassioned rake,\r\nand the rolls of gold were restored to the tray from whence they had\r\nbeen taken.\r\n\r\nBurgo looked up and smiled at them all round the table. By this\r\ntime most of those who stood around were looking at him. He was a\r\nman who gathered eyes upon him wherever he might be, or whatever\r\nhe was doing; and it had been clear that he was very intent upon\r\nhis fortune, and on the last occasion the amount staked had been\r\nconsiderable. He knew that men and women were looking at him, and\r\ntherefore he smiled faintly as he turned his eyes round the table.\r\nThen he got up, and, putting his hands in his trousers pockets,\r\nwhistled as he walked away. His companion followed him, and laid a\r\nhand upon his shoulder; but Burgo shook him off, and would not turn\r\nround. He shook him off, and walked on whistling, the length of the\r\nwhole salon.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said Lady Glencora, "it is Burgo Fitzgerald." Mr. Palliser\r\nhad gone so deep into that question of German finance that he had not\r\nat all noticed the gambler. "Alice, what can we do for him? It is\r\nBurgo," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nMany eyes were now watching him. Used as he was to the world and to\r\nmisfortune, he was not successful in his attempt to bear his loss\r\nwith a show of indifference. The motion of his head, the position of\r\nhis hands, the tone of his whistling, all told the tale. Even the\r\nunimpassioned croupiers furtively cast an eye after him, and a very\r\nbig Guard, in a cocked hat, and uniform, and sword, who hitherto\r\nhad hardly been awake, seemed evidently to be interested by his\r\nmovements. If there is to be a tragedy at these places,--and\r\ntragedies will sometimes occur,--it is always as well that the tragic\r\nscene should be as far removed as possible from the salons, in order\r\nthat the public eye should not suffer.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora and Alice had left their places, and had shrunk back,\r\nalmost behind a pillar. "Is it he, in truth?" Alice asked.\r\n\r\n"In very truth," said Glencora. "What can I do? Can I do anything?\r\nLook at him, Alice. If he were to destroy himself, what should I do\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\nBurgo, conscious that he was the regarded of all eyes, turned round\r\nupon his heel and again walked the length of the salon. He knew well\r\nthat he had not a franc left in his possession, but still he laughed\r\nand still he whistled. His companion, whoever he might be, had slunk\r\naway from him, not caring to share the notoriety which now attended\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What shall I do, Alice?" said Lady Glencora, with her eyes still\r\nfixed on him who had been her lover.\r\n\r\n"Tell Mr. Palliser," whispered Alice.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora immediately ran up to her husband, and took him away\r\nfrom Mr. Grey. Rapidly she told her story,--with such rapidity that Mr.\r\nPalliser could hardly get in a word. "Do something for him;--do, do.\r\nUnless I know that something is done, I shall die. You needn\'t be\r\nafraid."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora, as she went on quickly, got hold of her husband\'s\r\nhand, and caressed it. "You are so good," said she. "Don\'t let him\r\nout of your sight. There; he is going. I will go home with Mr. Grey.\r\nI will be ever so good; I will, indeed. You know what he\'ll want, and\r\nfor my sake you\'ll let him have it. But don\'t let him gamble. If you\r\ncould only get him home to England, and then do something. You owe\r\nhim something, Plantagenet; do you not?"\r\n\r\n"If money can do anything, he shall have it."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, dearest! I shall never see him again; but if you\r\ncould save him! There;--he is going now. Go;--go." She pushed him\r\nforward, and then retreating, put her arm within Mr. Grey\'s, still\r\nkeeping her eye upon her husband.\r\n\r\nBurgo, when he first got to the door leading out of the salon,\r\nhad paused a moment, and, turning round, had encountered the big\r\ngendarme close to him. "Well, old Buffer, what do you want?" said\r\nhe, accosting the man in English. The big gendarme simply walked on\r\nthrough the door, and said nothing. Then Burgo also passed out, and\r\nMr. Palliser quickly went after him. They were now in the large front\r\nsalon, from whence the chief door of the building opened out upon the\r\nsteps. Through this door Burgo went without pausing, and Mr. Palliser\r\nwent after him. They both walked to the end of the row of buildings,\r\nand then Burgo, leaving the broad way, turned into a little path\r\nwhich led up through the trees to the hills. That hillside among the\r\ntrees is a popular resort at Baden, during the day; but now, at nine\r\nin the evening, it was deserted. Palliser did not press on the other\r\nman, but followed him, and did not accost Burgo till he had thrown\r\nhimself on the grass beneath a tree.\r\n\r\n"You are in trouble, I fear, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Mr. Palliser, as\r\nsoon as he was close at Burgo\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"We will go home. Mr. Palliser has something to do," said Lady\r\nGlencora to Mr. Grey, as soon as the two men had disappeared from her\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n"Is that a friend of Mr. Palliser?" said Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that is, he knows him, and is interested about him. Alice,\r\nshall we go home? Oh! Mr. Grey, you must not ask any questions.\r\nHe,--Mr. Palliser, will tell you everything when he sees you,--that\r\nis, if there is anything to be told." Then they all went home, and\r\nsoon separated for the night. "Of course I shall sit up for him,"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora to Alice, "but I will do it in my own room. You\r\ncan tell Mr. Grey, if you like." But Alice told nothing to Mr. Grey,\r\nnor did Mr. Grey ask any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Landlord\'s Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n"You are in trouble, Mr. Fitzgerald, I fear," said Mr. Palliser,\r\nstanding over Burgo as he lay upon the ground. They were now\r\naltogether beyond the gas-lights, and the evening was dark. Burgo,\r\ntoo, was lying with his face to the ground, expecting that the\r\nfootsteps which he had heard would pass by him.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" said he, turning round suddenly; but still he was not\r\nat once able to recognize Mr. Palliser, whose voice was hardly known\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have been wrong in following you," said Mr. Palliser, "but\r\nI thought you were in distress, and that probably I might help you.\r\nMy name is Palliser."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet Palliser?" said Burgo, jumping up on to his legs and\r\nlooking close into the other\'s face. "By heavens! it is Plantagenet\r\nPalliser! Well, Mr. Palliser, what do you want of me?"\r\n\r\n"I want to be of some use to you, if I can. I and my wife saw you\r\nleave the gaming-table just now."\r\n\r\n"Is she here too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she is here. We are going home, but chance brought us up to\r\nthe salon. She seemed to think that you are in distress, and that I\r\ncould help you. I will, if you will let me."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser, during the whole interview, felt that he could afford to\r\nbe generous. He knew that he had no further cause for fear. He had no\r\nlingering dread of this poor creature who stood before him. All that\r\nfeeling was over, though it was as yet hardly four months since he\r\nhad been sent back by Mrs. Marsham to Lady Monk\'s house to save his\r\nwife, if saving her were yet possible.\r\n\r\n"So she is here, is she;--and saw me there when I staked my last\r\nchance? I should have had over twenty thousand francs now, if the\r\ncards had stood to me."\r\n\r\n"The cards never do stand to any one, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Never;--never,--never!" said Burgo. "At any rate, they never did to\r\nme. Nothing ever does stand to me."\r\n\r\n"If you want twenty thousand francs,--that\'s eight hundred pounds, I\r\nthink--I can let you have it without any trouble."\r\n\r\n"The devil you can!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. As I am travelling with my family--" I wonder whether Mr.\r\nPalliser considered himself to be better entitled to talk of his\r\nfamily than he had been some three or four weeks back--"As I am\r\ntravelling with my family, I have been obliged to carry large bills\r\nwith me, and I can accommodate you without any trouble."\r\n\r\nThere was something pleasant in this, which made Burgo Fitzgerald\r\nlaugh. Mr. Palliser, the husband of Lady Glencora M\'Cluskie, and the\r\nheir of the Duke of Omnium happening to have money with him! As if\r\nMr. Palliser could not bring down showers of money in any quarter\r\nof the globe by simply holding up his hand. And then to talk of\r\naccommodating him,--Burgo Fitzgerald, as though it were simply a\r\nlittle matter of convenience,--as though Mr. Palliser would of course\r\nfind the money at his bankers\' when he next examined his book! Burgo\r\ncould not but laugh.\r\n\r\n"I was not in the least doubting your ability to raise the money,"\r\nsaid he; "but how would you propose to get it back again?"\r\n\r\n"That would be at your convenience," said Mr. Palliser, who hardly\r\nknew how to put himself on a proper footing with his companion, so\r\nthat he might offer to do something effectual for the man\'s aid.\r\n\r\n"I never have any such convenience," said Burgo. "Who were those\r\nwomen whose tubs always had holes at the bottom of them? My tub\r\nalways has such a hole."\r\n\r\n"You mean the daughters of Danaus," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whose daughters they were, but you might just as well\r\nlend them all eight hundred pounds apiece."\r\n\r\n"There were so many of them," said Mr. Palliser, trying a little joke.\r\n"But as you are only one I shall be most happy, as I said before, to\r\nbe of service."\r\n\r\nThey were now walking slowly together up towards the hills, and near\r\nto them they heard a step. Upon this, Burgo turned round.\r\n\r\n"Do you see that fellow?" said he. Mr. Palliser, who was somewhat\r\nshort-sighted, said that he did not see him. "I do, though. I don\'t\r\nknow his name, but they have sent him out from the hotel with me, to\r\nsee what I do with myself. I owe them six or seven hundred francs,\r\nand they want to turn me out of the house and not let me take my\r\nthings with me."\r\n\r\n"That would be very uncomfortable," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"It would be uncomfortable, but I shall be too many for them. If they\r\nkeep my traps they shall keep me. They think I\'m going to blow my\r\nbrains out. That\'s what they think. The man lets me go far enough off\r\nto do that,--so long as it\'s nowhere about the house."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'re not thinking of such a thing?"\r\n\r\n"As long as I can help it, Mr. Palliser, I never think of anything."\r\nThe stranger was now standing near to them,--almost so near that he\r\nmight hear their words. Burgo, perceiving this, walked up to him,\r\nand, speaking in bad French, desired him to leave them. "Don\'t you\r\nsee that I have a friend with me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! a friend," said the man, answering in bad English. "Perhaps de\r\nfriend can advance moneys?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind what he can do," said Burgo. "You do as you are bid, and\r\nleave me."\r\n\r\nThen the gentleman from the hotel retreated down the hill, but Mr.\r\nPalliser, during the rest of the interview, frequently fancied that\r\nhe heard the man\'s footfall at no great distance.\r\n\r\nThey continued to walk on up the hill very slowly, and it was some\r\ntime before Mr. Palliser knew how to repeat his offer.\r\n\r\n"So Lady Glencora is here?" Burgo said again.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is here. It was she who asked me to come to you," Mr.\r\nPalliser answered. Then they both walked on a few steps in silence,\r\nfor neither of them knew how to address the other.\r\n\r\n"By George!--isn\'t it odd," said Burgo, at last, "that you and I, of\r\nall men in the world, should be walking together here at Baden? It\'s\r\nnot only that you\'re the richest man in London, and that I\'m the\r\npoorest, but--; there are other things, you know, which make it so\r\nfunny."\r\n\r\n"There have been things which make me and my wife very anxious to\r\ngive you aid."\r\n\r\n"And have you considered, Mr. Palliser, that those things make you the\r\nvery man in the world,--indeed, for the matter of that, the only man\r\nin the world,--from whom I can\'t take aid. I would have taken it all\r\nif I could have got it,--and I tried hard."\r\n\r\n"I know you have been disappointed, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Disappointed! By G----! yes. Did you ever know any man who had so\r\nmuch right to be disappointed as I have? I did love her, Mr. Palliser.\r\nNay, by heavens! I do love her. Out here I will dare to say as much\r\neven to you. I shall never try to see her again. All that is over, of\r\ncourse. I\'ve been a fool about her as I have been about everything.\r\nBut I did love her."\r\n\r\n"I believe it, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"It was not altogether her money. But think what it would have been\r\nto me, Mr. Palliser. Think what a chance I had, and what a chance\r\nI lost. I should have been at the top of everything,--as now I am\r\nat the bottom. I should not have spent that. There would have been\r\nenough of it to have saved me. And then I might have done something\r\ngood instead of crawling about almost in fear of that beast who is\r\nwatching us."\r\n\r\n"It has been ordered otherwise," said Mr. Palliser, not knowing what\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it has been ordered, with a vengeance! It seems to have been\r\nordered that I\'m to go to the devil; but I don\'t know who gave the\r\norders, and I don\'t know why."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser had not time to explain to his friend that the orders had\r\nbeen given, in a very peremptory way, by himself, as he was anxious\r\nto bring back the conversation to his own point. He wished to give\r\nsome serviceable, and, if possible, permanent aid to the poor\r\nne\'er-do-well; but he did not wish to talk more than could be helped\r\nabout his own wife.\r\n\r\n"There is an old saying, which you will remember well," said he,\r\n"that the way to good manners is never too late."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense," said Burgo. "It\'s too late when the man feels the\r\nknot round his neck at the Old Bailey."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, even then. Indeed, we may say, certainly not, if the\r\nman be still able to take the right way. But I don\'t want to preach\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do any good, you know."\r\n\r\n"But I do want to be of service to you. There is something of truth\r\nin what you say. You have been disappointed; and I, perhaps, of all\r\nmen am the most bound to come to your assistance now that you are in\r\nneed."\r\n\r\n"How can I take it from you?" said Burgo, almost crying.\r\n\r\n"You shall take it from her!"\r\n\r\n"No;--that would be worse; twenty times worse. What! take her money,\r\nwhen she would not give me herself!"\r\n\r\n"I do not see why you should not borrow her money,--or mine. You\r\nshall call it which you will."\r\n\r\n"No; I won\'t have it."\r\n\r\n"And what will you do then?"\r\n\r\n"What will I do? Ah! That\'s the question. I don\'t know what I will\r\ndo. I have the key of my bedroom in my pocket, and I will go to bed\r\nto-night. It\'s not very often that I look forward much beyond that."\r\n\r\n"Will you let me call on you, to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what good it will do? I shan\'t get up till late, for\r\nfear they should shut the room against me. I might as well have as\r\nmuch out of them as I can. I think I shall say I\'m ill, and keep my\r\nbed."\r\n\r\n"Will you take a few napoleons?"\r\n\r\n"No; not a rap. Not from you. You are the first man from whom I ever\r\nrefused to borrow money, and I should say that you\'ll be about the\r\nlast to offer to lend it me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what else I can offer?" said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"You can offer nothing. If you will say to your wife from me that\r\nI bade her adieu;--that is all you can do for me. Good night, Mr.\r\nPalliser; good night."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Good night, Mr. Palliser."]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser left him and went his way, feeling that he had no further\r\neloquence at his command. He shook Burgo\'s hand, and then walked\r\nquickly down the hill. As he did so he passed, or would have passed\r\nthe man who had been dodging them.\r\n\r\n"Misther, Misther!" said the man in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"What do you want of me?" asked Mr. Palliser, in French.\r\n\r\nThen the man spoke in French, also. "Has he got any money? Have you\r\ngiven him any money?"\r\n\r\n"I have not given him any money," said Mr. Palliser, not quite knowing\r\nwhat he had better do or say under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n"Then he will have a bad time with it," said the man. "And he might\r\nhave carried away two thousand francs just now! Dear, dear, dear! Has\r\nhe got any friends, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has friends. I do not know that I can assist him, or you."\r\n\r\n"Fitzgerald;--his name is Fitzgerald?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Palliser; "his name is Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Ah! There are so many Fitzgeralds in England. Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nLondon;--he has no other address?"\r\n\r\n"If he had, and I knew it, I should not give it you without his\r\nsanction."\r\n\r\n"But what shall we do? How shall we act? Perhaps with his own hand he\r\nwill himself kill. For five weeks his pension he owes; yes, for five\r\nweeks. And for wine, oh so much! There came through Baden a my lord,\r\nand then, I think he got money. But he went and played. That was of\r\ncourse. But; oh my G----! he might have carried away this night two\r\nthousand francs; yes, two thousand francs!"\r\n\r\n"Are you the hotelkeeper?"\r\n\r\n"His friend, sir; only his friend. That is, I am the head\r\nCommissionaire. I look after the gentlemen who sometimes are not\r\nall--not all--" exactly what they should be, the commissioner\r\nintended to explain; and Mr. Palliser understood him although the\r\nwords were not quite spoken. The interview was ended by Mr. Palliser\r\ntaking the name of the hotel, and promising to call before Mr.\r\nFitzgerald should be up in the morning--a purposed visit, which we\r\nneed not regard as requiring any very early energy on Mr. Palliser\'s\r\npart, when we remember Burgo\'s own programme for the following day.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora received her husband that night with infinite anxiety,\r\nand was by no means satisfied with what had been done. He described\r\nto her as accurately as he could the nature of his interview with\r\nBurgo, and he described to her also his other interview with the head\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\n"He will; he will," said Lady Glencora; when she heard from her\r\nhusband the man\'s surmise that perhaps he might destroy himself.\r\n"He will; he will; and if he does, how can you expect that I shall\r\nbear it?" Mr. Palliser tried to soothe her by telling her of his\r\npromised visit to the landlord; and Lady Glencora, accepting this as\r\nsomething, strove to instigate her husband to some lavish expenditure\r\non Burgo\'s behalf. "There can be no reason why he should not take\r\nit," said Glencora. "None the least. Had it not been promised to him?\r\nHad he not a right to it?" The subject was one which Mr. Palliser\r\nfound it very hard to discuss. He could not tell his wife that\r\nFitzgerald ought to accept his bounty; but he assured her that his\r\nmoney should be forthcoming, almost to any extent, if it could be\r\nmade available.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he went down to the hotel, and saw the\r\nreal landlord. He found him to be a reasonable, tranquil, and very\r\ngood-natured man,--who was possessed by a not irrational desire that\r\nhis customers\' bills should be paid; but who seemed to be much less\r\neager on the subject than are English landlords in general. His chief\r\nanxiety seemed to arise from the great difficulty of doing anything\r\nwith the gentleman who was now lying in his bed up-stairs. "Has he\r\nhad any breakfast?" Mr. Palliser asked.\r\n\r\n"Breakfast! Oh yes;" and the landlord laughed. He had been very\r\nparticular in the orders he had given. He had desired his cutlets to\r\nbe dressed in a particular way,--with a great deal of cayenne pepper,\r\nand they had been so dressed. He had ordered a bottle of Sauterne;\r\nbut the landlord had thought, or the head-waiter acting for him had\r\nthought, that a bottle of ordinary wine of the country would do as\r\nwell. The bottle of ordinary wine of the country had just that moment\r\nbeen sent up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Palliser sat down in the landlord\'s little room, and had\r\nBurgo Fitzgerald\'s bill brought to him. "I think I might venture to\r\npay it," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"That was as monsieur pleased," said the landlord, with something\r\nlike a sparkle in his eye.\r\n\r\nWhat was Mr. Palliser to do? He did not know whether, in accordance\r\nwith the rules of the world in which he lived, he ought to pay it,\r\nor ought to leave it; and certainly the landlord could not tell him.\r\nThen he thought of his wife. He could not go back to his wife without\r\nhaving done something; so, as a first measure, he paid the bill. The\r\nlandlord\'s eyes glittered, and he receipted it in the most becoming\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"Should he now send up the bottle of Sauterne?"--but to this Mr.\r\nPalliser demurred.\r\n\r\n"And to whom should the receipted bill be given?" Mr. Palliser thought\r\nthat the landlord had better keep it himself for a while.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there is some little difficulty?" suggested the landlord.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser acknowledged that there was a little difficulty. He knew\r\nthat he must do something more. He could not simply pay the bill\r\nand go away. That would not satisfy his wife. He knew that he must\r\ndo something more; but how was he to do it? So at last he let the\r\nlandlord into his confidence. He did not tell the whole of Burgo\'s\r\npast history. He did not tell that little episode in Burgo\'s life\r\nwhich referred to Lady Glencora. But he did make the landlord\r\nunderstand that he was willing to administer money to Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nif only it could only be administered judiciously.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t keep him out of the gambling salon, you know, sir; that\r\nis, not if he has a franc in his pocket." As to that the landlord was\r\nvery confident.\r\n\r\nIt was at last arranged, that the landlord was to tell Burgo that his\r\nbill did not signify at present, and that the use of the hotel was to\r\nbe at Burgo\'s command for the next three months. At the end of that\r\ntime he was to have notice to quit. No money was to be advanced to\r\nhim;--but the landlord, even in this respect, had a discretion.\r\n\r\n"When I get home, I will see what can be done with his relations\r\nthere," said Mr. Palliser. Then he went home and told his wife.\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll have no clothes," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser said that the judicious landlord would manage that also;\r\nand in that way Lady Glencora was appeased,--appeased, till something\r\nfinal could be done for the young man, on Mr. Palliser\'s return home.\r\n\r\nPoor Burgo! He must now be made to end his career as far as these\r\npages are concerned. He soon found that something had been done for\r\nhim at the hotel, and no doubt he must have made some guess near\r\nthe truth. The discreet landlord told him nothing,--would tell him\r\nnothing; but that his bill did not signify as yet. Burgo, thinking\r\nabout it, resolved to write about it in an indignant strain to Mr.\r\nPalliser; but the letter did not get itself written. When in England,\r\nMr. Palliser saw Sir Cosmo Monk, and with many apologies, told him\r\nwhat he had done.\r\n\r\n"I regret it," said Sir Cosmo, in anger. "I regret it; not for the\r\nmoney\'s sake, but I regret it." The amount expended, was however\r\nrepaid to Mr. Palliser, and an arrangement was made for remitting\r\na weekly sum of fifteen pounds to Burgo, through a member of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, as long as he should remain at a certain small\r\nGerman town which was indicated, and in which there was no public\r\ngambling-table. Lady Glencora expressed herself satisfied for the\r\npresent; but I must doubt whether poor Burgo lived long in comfort\r\non the allowance made to him.\r\n\r\nHere we must say farewell to Burgo Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Travellers Return Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser did not remain long in Baden after the payment of\r\nBurgo\'s bill. Perhaps I shall not throw any undeserved discredit\r\non his courage if I say that he was afraid to do so. What would he\r\nhave said,--what would he have been able to say, if that young man\r\nhad come to him demanding an explanation? So he hurried away to\r\nStrasbourg the same day, much to his wife\'s satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe journey home from thence was not marked by any incidents.\r\nGradually Mr. Palliser became a little more lenient to his wife and\r\nslightly less oppressive in his caution. If he still inquired about\r\nthe springs of the carriages, he did so in silence, and he ceased to\r\nenjoin the necessity of a day\'s rest after each day\'s journey. By\r\nthe time that they reached Dover he had become so used to his wife\'s\r\ncondition that he made but little fluttering as she walked out of\r\nthe boat by that narrow gangway which is so contrived as to make an\r\narrival there a serious inconvenience to a lady, and a nuisance even\r\nto a man. He was somewhat staggered when a big man, in the middle\r\nof the night, insisted on opening the little basket which his wife\r\ncarried, and was uncomfortable when obliged to stop her on the plank\r\nwhile he gave up the tickets which he thought had been already\r\nsurrendered; but he was becoming used to his position, and bore\r\nhimself like a man.\r\n\r\nDuring their journey home Mr. Palliser had by no means kept his seat\r\nopposite to Lady Glencora with constancy. He had soon found that it\r\nwas easier to talk to Mr. Grey than to his wife, and, consequently,\r\nthe two ladies had been much together, as had also the two gentlemen.\r\nWhat the ladies discussed may be imagined. One was about to become\r\na wife and the other a mother, and that was to be their fate after\r\neach had made up her mind that no such lot was to be hers. It may,\r\nhowever, be presumed that for every one word that Alice spoke Lady\r\nGlencora spoke ten. The two men, throughout these days of close\r\nintimacy, were intent upon politics. Mr. Palliser, who may be regarded\r\nas the fox who had lost his tail,--the tail being, in this instance,\r\nthe comfort of domestic privacy,--was eager in recommending his new\r\nfriend to cut off his tail also. "Your argument would be very well,"\r\nsaid he, "if men were to be contented to live for themselves only."\r\n\r\n"Your argument would be very well," said the other, "if it were used\r\nto a man who felt that he could do good to others by going into\r\npublic life. But it is wholly inefficacious if it recommends public\r\nlife simply or chiefly because a man may gratify his own ambition by\r\npublic services."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is personal gratification, and of course there is\r\ngood done," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Is,--or should be," said Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\n"Exactly; and the two things must go together. The chief\r\ngratification comes from the feeling that you are of use."\r\n\r\n"But if you feel that you would not be of use?"\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the argument any further. We all know its nature,\r\nand what between two such men would be said on both sides. We all\r\nknow that neither of them would put the matter altogether in a true\r\nlight. Men never can do so in words, let the light within themselves\r\nbe ever so clear. I do not think that any man yet ever had such a\r\ngift of words as to make them a perfect exponent of all the wisdom\r\nwithin him. But the effect was partly that which the weaker man of\r\nthe two desired,--the weaker in the gifts of nature, though art\r\nhad in some respects made him stronger. Mr. Grey was shaken in his\r\nquiescent philosophy, and startled Alice,--startled her as much as he\r\ndelighted her,--by a word or two he said as he walked with her in the\r\ncourts of the Louvre. "It\'s all hollow here," he said, speaking of\r\nFrench politics.\r\n\r\n"Very hollow," said Alice, who had no love for the French mode of\r\ncarrying on public affairs.\r\n\r\n"Of all modes of governing this seems to me to be the surest of\r\ncoming to a downfall. Men are told that they are wise enough to talk,\r\nbut not wise enough to have any power of action. It is as though men\r\nwere cautioned that they were walking through gunpowder, and that\r\nno fire could be allowed them, but were at the same time enjoined\r\nto carry lucifer matches in their pockets. I don\'t believe in the\r\ngunpowder, and I think there should be fire, and plenty of it; but if\r\nI didn\'t want the fire I wouldn\'t have the matches."\r\n\r\n"It\'s so odd to hear you talk politics," said Alice, laughing.\r\n\r\nAfter this he dropped the subject for a while, as though he were\r\nashamed of it, but in a very few minutes he returned to it manfully.\r\n"Mr. Palliser wants me to go into Parliament." Upon hearing this Alice\r\nsaid nothing. She was afraid to speak. After all that had passed she\r\nfelt that it would not become her to show much outward joy on hearing\r\nsuch a proposition, so spoken by him, and yet she could say nothing\r\nwithout some sign of exultation in her voice. So she walked on\r\nwithout speaking, and was conscious that her fingers trembled on his\r\narm. "What do you say about it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What do I say? Oh, John, what right can I have to say anything?"\r\n\r\n"No one else can have so much right,--putting aside of course myself,\r\nwho must be responsible for my own actions. He asked me whether I\r\ncould afford it, and he seems to think that a smaller income suffices\r\nfor such work now than it did a few years since. I believe that I\r\ncould afford it, if I could get a seat that was not very expensive at\r\nthe first outset. He could help me there."\r\n\r\n"On that point, of course, I can have no opinion."\r\n\r\n"No; not on that point. I believe we may take that for granted.\r\nLiving in London for four or five months in the year might be\r\nmanaged. But as to the mode of life!"\r\n\r\nThen Alice was unable to hold her tongue longer, and spoke out her\r\nthoughts with more vehemence than discretion. No doubt he combated\r\nthem with some amount of opposition. He seldom allowed out-spoken\r\nenthusiasm to pass by him without some amount of hostility. But he\r\nwas not so perverse as to be driven from his new views by the fact\r\nthat Alice approved them, and she, as she drew near home, was able\r\nto think that the only flaw in his character was in process of being\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached London they all separated. It was Mr. Palliser\'s\r\npurpose to take his wife down to Matching with as little delay as\r\npossible. London was at this time nearly empty, and all the doings\r\nof the season were over. It was now the first week of August, and\r\nas Parliament had not been sitting for nearly two months, the town\r\nlooked as it usually looks in September. Lady Glencora was to stay\r\nbut one day in Park Lane, and it had been understood between her and\r\nAlice that they were not to see each other.\r\n\r\n"How odd it is parting in this way, when people have been together so\r\nlong," said Lady Glencora. "It always seems as though there had been\r\na separate little life of its own which was now to be brought to a\r\nclose. I suppose, Mr. Grey, you and I, when we next meet, will be far\r\ntoo distant to fight with each other."\r\n\r\n"I hope that may never be the case," said Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\n"I suppose nothing would prevent his fighting; would it Alice? But,\r\nremember, there must be no fighting when we do meet next, and that\r\nmust be in September."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart," said Mr. Grey. But Alice said nothing.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Palliser made his little speech. "Alice," he said, as he gave\r\nhis hand to Miss Vavasor, "give my compliments to your father, and\r\ntell him that I shall take the liberty of asking him to come down to\r\nMatching for the early shooting in September, and that I shall expect\r\nhim to bring you with him. You may tell him also that he will have\r\nto stay to see you off, but that he will not be allowed to take you\r\naway." Lady Glencora thought that this was very pretty as coming from\r\nher husband, and so she told him on their way home.\r\n\r\nAlice insisted on going to Queen Anne Street in a cab by herself.\r\nMr. Palliser had offered a carriage, and Mr. Grey, of course, offered\r\nhimself as a protector; but she would have neither the one nor the\r\nother. If he had gone with her he might by chance have met her\r\nfather, and she was most anxious that she should not be encumbered\r\nby her lover\'s presence when she first received her father\'s\r\ncongratulations. They had slept at Dover, and had come up by a\r\nmid-day train. When she reached Queen Anne Street, the house was\r\ndesolate, and she might therefore have allowed Mr. Grey to attend her.\r\nBut she found a letter waiting for her which made her for the moment\r\nforget both him and her father. Lady Macleod, at Cheltenham, was very\r\nill, and wished to see her niece, as she said, before she died. "I\r\nhave got your letter," said the kind old woman, "and am now quite\r\nhappy. It only wanted that to reconcile me to my departure. I thought\r\nthrough it all that my girl would be happy at last. Will she forgive\r\nme if I say that I have forgiven her?" The letter then went on to beg\r\nAlice to come to Cheltenham at once. "It is not that I am dying now,"\r\nsaid Lady Macleod, "though you will find me much altered and keeping\r\nmy bed. But the doctor says he fears the first cold weather. I know\r\nwhat that means, my dear; and if I don\'t see you now, before your\r\nmarriage, I shall never see you again. Pray get married as soon as\r\nyou can. I want to know that you are Mrs. Grey before I go. If I were\r\nto hear that it was postponed because of my illness, I think it would\r\nkill me at once."\r\n\r\nThere was another letter for her from Kate, full, of course, of\r\ncongratulations, and promising to be at the wedding; "that is," said\r\nKate, "unless it takes place at the house of some one of your very\r\ngrand friends;" and telling her that aunt Greenow was to be married\r\nin a fortnight;--telling her of this, and begging her to attend that\r\nwedding. "You should stand by your family," said Kate. "And only\r\nthink what my condition will be if I have no one here to support me.\r\nDo come. Journeys are nothing nowadays. Don\'t you know I would go\r\nseven times the distance for you? Mr. Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield\r\nare friends after all, and Mr. Cheesacre is to be best man. Is it\r\nnot beautiful? As for poor me, I\'m told I haven\'t a chance left of\r\nbecoming mistress of Oileymead and all its wealth."\r\n\r\nAlice began to think that her hands were almost too full. If\r\nshe herself were to be married in September, even by the end of\r\nSeptember, her hands were very full indeed. Yet she did not know how\r\nto refuse any of the requests made to her. As to Lady Macleod, her\r\nvisit to her was a duty which must of course be performed at once.\r\nShe would stay but one day in London, and then go down to Cheltenham.\r\nHaving resolved upon this she at once wrote to her aunt to that\r\neffect. As to that other affair down in Westmoreland, she sighed\r\nas she thought of it, but she feared that she must go there also.\r\nKate had suffered too much on her behalf to allow of her feeling\r\nindifferent to such a request.\r\n\r\nThen her father came in. "I didn\'t in the least know when you might\r\narrive," said he, beginning with an apology for his absence. "How\r\ncould I, my dear?" Alice scorned to remind him that she herself had\r\nnamed the precise hour of the train by which they had arrived. "It\'s\r\nall right, papa," said she. "I was very glad to have an hour to write\r\na letter or two. Poor Lady Macleod is very ill. I must go to her the\r\nday after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, dear! I had heard that she was poorly. She is very old,\r\nyou know. So, Alice, you\'ve made it all square with Mr. Grey at last?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa;--if you call that square."\r\n\r\n"Well; I do call it square. It has all come round to the proper\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"I hope he thinks so."\r\n\r\n"What do you think yourself, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt it\'s the proper thing for me, papa."\r\n\r\n"Of course not; of course not; and I can tell you this, Alice, he is\r\na man in a thousand. You\'ve heard about the money?"\r\n\r\n"What money, papa?"\r\n\r\n"The money that George had." As the reader is aware, Alice had heard\r\nnothing special about this money. She only knew, or supposed she\r\nknew, that she had given three thousand pounds to her cousin. But now\r\nher father explained to her the whole transaction. "We couldn\'t have\r\nrealized your money for months, perhaps," said he; "but Grey knew\r\nthat some men must have rope enough before they can hang themselves."\r\n\r\nAlice was unable to say anything on this subject to her father, but\r\nto herself she did declare that not in that way or with that hope\r\nhad John Grey produced his money. "He must be paid, papa," she said.\r\n"Paid!" he answered; "he can pay himself now. It may make some\r\ndifference in the settlements, perhaps, but he and the lawyers may\r\narrange that. I shan\'t think of interfering with such a man as Grey.\r\nIf you could only know, my dear, what I\'ve suffered!" Alice in a\r\npenitential tone expressed her sorrow, and then he too assured her\r\nthat he had forgiven her. "Bless you, my child!" he said, "and make\r\nyou happy, and good, and--and--and very comfortable." After that he\r\nwent back to his club.\r\n\r\nAlice made her journey down to Cheltenham without any adventure, and\r\nwas received by Lady Macleod with open arms. "Dearest Alice, it is so\r\ngood of you." "Good!" said Alice, "would I not have gone a thousand\r\nmiles to you?"\r\n\r\nLady Macleod was very eager to know all about the coming marriage.\r\n"I can tell you now, my dear, though I couldn\'t do it before, that\r\nI knew he\'d persist for ever. He told me so himself in confidence."\r\n\r\n"He has persisted, aunt; that is certain."\r\n\r\n"And I hope you\'ll reward him. A beautiful woman without discretion\r\nis like a pearl in a swine\'s snout; but a good wife is a crown of\r\nglory to her husband. Remember that, my dear, and choose your part\r\nfor his sake."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be that unfortunate pearl, if I can help it, aunt."\r\n\r\n"We can all help it, if we set about it in the right way. And Alice,\r\nyou must be careful to find out all his likes and his dislikes. Dear\r\nme! I remember how hard I found it, but then I don\'t think I was so\r\nclever as you are."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I think nobody has ever been so stupid as I have."\r\n\r\n"Not stupid, my dear; if I must say the word, it is self-willed. But,\r\ndear, all that is forgiven now. Is it not?"\r\n\r\n"There is a forgiveness which it is rather hard to get," said Alice.\r\n\r\nThere was something said then as to the necessity of looking for\r\npardon beyond this world, which I need not here repeat. To all her\r\nold friend\'s little sermons Alice was infinitely more attentive than\r\nhad been her wont, so that Lady Macleod was comforted and took heart\r\nof grace, and at last brought forth from under her pillow a letter\r\nfrom the Countess of Midlothian, which she had received a day or\r\ntwo since, and which bore upon Alice\'s case. "I was not quite sure\r\nwhether I\'d show it you," said Lady Macleod, "because you wouldn\'t\r\nanswer her when she wrote to you. But when I\'m gone, as I shall be\r\nsoon, she will be the nearest relative you have on your mother\'s\r\nside, and from her great position, you know, Alice--" But here Alice\r\nbecame impatient for the letter. Her aunt handed it to her, and she\r\nread as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Castle Reekie, July, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAR LADY MACLEOD,--\r\n\r\n   I am sorry to hear of the symptoms you speak about. I\r\n   strongly advise you to depend chiefly on beef-tea. They\r\n   should be very careful to send it up quite free from\r\n   grease, and it should not be too strong of the meat. There\r\n   should be no vegetables in it. Not soup, you know, but\r\n   beef-tea. If any thing acts upon your strength, that will.\r\n   I need not tell one who has lived as you have done where\r\n   to look for that other strength which alone can support\r\n   you at such a time as this. I would go to you if I thought\r\n   that my presence would be any comfort to you, but I know\r\n   how sensitive you are, and the shock might be too much for\r\n   you.\r\n\r\n   If you see Alice Vavasor on her return to England, as you\r\n   probably will, pray tell her from me that I give her my\r\n   warmest congratulations, and that I am heartily glad that\r\n   matters are arranged. I think she treated my attempts to\r\n   heal the wound in a manner that they did not deserve; but\r\n   all that shall be forgiven, as shall also her original bad\r\n   behaviour to poor Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice was becoming weary of so much forgiveness, and told herself,\r\nas she was reading the letter, that that of Lady Midlothian was at\r\nany rate unnecessary. "I trust that we may yet meet and be friends,"\r\ncontinued Lady Midlothian. "I am extremely gratified at finding that\r\nshe has been thought so much of by Mr. Palliser. I\'m told that Mr.\r\nPalliser and Mr. Grey have become great friends, and if this is so,\r\nAlice must be happy to feel that she has had it in her power to\r\nconfer so great a benefit on her future husband as he will receive\r\nfrom this introduction." "I ain\'t a bit happy, and I have conferred\r\nno benefit on Mr. Grey," exclaimed Alice, who was unable to repress\r\nthe anger occasioned by the last paragraph.\r\n\r\n"But it is a great benefit, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser has every bit as much cause to be gratified for that as\r\nMr. Grey, and perhaps more."\r\n\r\nPoor Lady Macleod could not argue the matter in her present state.\r\nShe merely sighed, and moved her shrivelled old hand up and down upon\r\nthe counterpane. Alice finished the letter without further remarks.\r\nIt merely went on to say how happy the writer would be to know\r\nsomething of her cousin as Mrs. Grey, as also to know something of Mr.\r\nGrey, and then gave a general invitation to both Mr. and Mrs. Grey,\r\nasking them to come to Castle Reekie whenever they might be able. The\r\nMarchioness, with whom Lady Midlothian was staying, had expressly\r\ndesired her to give this message. Alice, however, could not but\r\nobserve that Lady Midlothian\'s invitation applied only to another\r\nperson\'s house.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure she means well," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Indeed she does," said Lady Macleod, "and then you know you\'ll\r\nprobably have children; and think what a thing it will be for them to\r\nknow the Midlothian family. You shouldn\'t rob them of their natural\r\nadvantages."\r\n\r\nAlice remained a week with her aunt, and went from thence direct to\r\nWestmoreland. Some order as to bridal preparations we must presume\r\nshe gave on that single day which she passed in London. Much\r\nadvice she had received on this head from Lady Glencora, and no\r\ninconsiderable amount of assistance was to be rendered to her at\r\nMatching during the fortnight she would remain there before her\r\nmarriage. Something also, let us hope, she might do at Cheltenham.\r\nSomething no doubt she did do. Something also might probably be\r\nachieved among the wilds in Westmoreland, but that something would\r\nnecessarily be of a nature not requiring fashionable tradespeople.\r\nWhile at Cheltenham, she determined that she would not again return\r\nto London before her marriage. This resolve was caused by a very\r\nurgent letter from Mr. Grey, and by another, almost equally urgent,\r\nfrom Lady Glencora. If the marriage did not take place in September\r\nshe would not be present at it. The gods of the world,--of Lady\r\nGlencora\'s world,--had met together and come to a great decision.\r\nLady Glencora was to be removed in October to Gatherum Castle, and\r\nremain there till the following spring, so that the heir might,\r\nin truth, be born in the purple. "It is such a bore," said Lady\r\nGlencora, "and I know it will be a girl. But the Duke isn\'t to be\r\nthere, except for the Christmas week." An invitation for the ceremony\r\nat Matching had been sent from Mr. Palliser to Mr. Vavasor, and another\r\nfrom Lady Glencora to Kate, "whom I long to know," said her ladyship,\r\n"and with whom I should like to pick a crow, if I dared, as I\'m sure\r\nshe did all the mischief."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre\'s Fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that Mrs. Greenow was a woman of great\r\nresources, and that she would be very prudent for others, though I\r\nfear the verdict of those who know her must go against her in regard\r\nto prudence in herself. Her marriage with Captain Bellfield was a\r\nrash act,--certainly a rash act, although she did take so much care\r\nin securing the payment of her own income into her own hands; but the\r\nmanner in which she made him live discreetly for some months previous\r\nto his marriage, the tact with which she renewed the friendship which\r\nhad existed between him and Mr. Cheesacre, and the skill she used in\r\nat last providing Mr. Cheesacre with a wife, oblige us all to admit\r\nthat, as a general, she had great powers.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice reached Vavasor Hall she found Charlie Fairstairs\r\nestablished there on a long visit. Charlie and Kate were to be\r\nthe two bridesmaids, and, as Kate told her cousin in their first\r\nconfidential intercourse on the evening of Alice\'s arrival, there\r\nwere already great hopes in the household that the master of\r\nOileymead might be brought to surrender. It was true that Charlie had\r\nnot a shilling, and that Mr. Cheesacre had set his heart on marrying\r\nan heiress. It was true that Miss Fairstairs had always stood low in\r\nthe gentleman\'s estimation, as being connected with people who were\r\nas much without rank and fashion as they were without money, and that\r\nthe gentleman loved rank and fashion dearly. It was true that Charlie\r\nwas no beauty, and that Cheesacre had an eye for feminine charms. It\r\nwas true that he had despised Charlie, and had spoken his contempt\r\nopenly;--that he had seen the girl on the sands at Yarmouth every\r\nsummer for the last ten years, and about the streets of Norwich every\r\nwinter, and had learned to regard her as a thing poor and despicable,\r\nbecause she was common in his eyes. It is thus that the Cheesacres\r\njudge of people. But in spite of all these difficulties Mrs. Greenow\r\nhad taken up poor Charlie\'s case, and Kate Vavasor expressed a strong\r\nopinion that her aunt would win.\r\n\r\n"What has she done to the man?" Alice asked.\r\n\r\n"Coaxed him; simply that. She has made herself so much his master\r\nthat he doesn\'t know how to say no to her. Sometimes I have thought\r\nthat he might possibly run away, but I have abandoned that fear now.\r\nShe has little confidences with him from day to day, which are so\r\nalluring to him that he cannot tear himself off. In the middle of one\r\nof them he will find himself engaged."\r\n\r\n"But, the unfortunate girl! Won\'t it be a wretched marriage for her?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. She\'ll make him a very good wife. He\'s one of those men\r\nto whom any woman, after a little time, will come to be the same.\r\nHe\'ll be rough with her once a month or so, and perhaps tell her\r\nthat she brought no money with her; but that won\'t break any bones,\r\nand Charlie will know how to fight her own battles. She\'ll save his\r\nmoney if she brings none, and in a few years\' time they will quite\r\nunderstand each other."\r\n\r\nMr. Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield were at this time living in\r\nlodgings together, at Penrith, but came over and spent every other\r\nday at Vavasor, returning always to their lodgings in the evening.\r\nIt wanted but eight days to the marriage when Alice arrived, and\r\npreparations for that event were in progress. "It\'s to be very quiet,\r\nAlice," said her aunt; "as quiet as such a thing can be made. I owe\r\nthat to the memory of the departed one. I know that he is looking\r\ndown upon me, and that he approves all that I do. Indeed, he told\r\nme once that he did not want me to live desolate for his sake. If I\r\ndidn\'t feel that he was looking down and approving it, I should be\r\nwretched indeed." She took Alice up to see her trousseau, and gave\r\nthe other expectant bride some little hints which, under present\r\ncircumstances, might be useful. "Yes, indeed; only three-and-sixpence\r\na piece, and they\'re quite real. Feel them. You wouldn\'t get them in\r\nthe shops under six." Alice did feel them, and wondered whether her\r\naunt could have saved the half-crown honestly. "I had my eyes about\r\nme when I was up in town, my dear. And look here, these are quite\r\nnew,--have never been on yet, and I had them when I was married\r\nbefore. There is nothing like being careful, my dear. I hate\r\nmeanness, as everybody knows who knows me; but there is nothing like\r\nbeing careful. You have a lot of rich people about you just now, and\r\nwill have ever so many things given you which you won\'t want. Do\r\nyou put them all by, and be careful. They may turn out useful, you\r\nknow." Saying this, Mrs. Greenow folded up, among her present bridal\r\nbelongings, sundries of the wealth which had accrued to her in an\r\nearlier stage of her career.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Greenow opened her mind to Alice about the Captain.\r\n"He\'s as good as gold, my dear; he is, indeed,--in his own way. Of\r\ncourse, I know that he has faults, and I should like to know who\r\nhasn\'t. Although poor dear Greenow certainly was more without them\r\nthan anybody else I ever knew." As this remembrance came upon Mrs.\r\nGreenow she put her handkerchief to her eyes, and Alice observed\r\nthat that which she held still bore the deepest hem of widowhood.\r\nThey would be used, no doubt, till the last day, and then put by in\r\nlavender for future possible occasions. "Bellfield may have been a\r\nlittle extravagant. I dare say he has. But how can a man help being\r\nextravagant when he hasn\'t got any regular income? He has been\r\nill-treated in his profession; very. It makes my blood curdle when I\r\nthink of it. After fighting his country\'s battles through blood, and\r\ndust, and wounds;--but I\'ll tell you about that another time."\r\n\r\n"I suppose a man seldom does make a fortune, aunt, by being a\r\nsoldier?"\r\n\r\n"Never, my dear; much better be a tailor. Don\'t you ever marry a\r\nsoldier. But as I was saying, he is the best-tempered creature\r\nalive, and the staunchest friend I ever met. You should hear what Mr.\r\nCheesacre says of him! But you don\'t know Mr. Cheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"No, aunt, not yet. If you remember, he went away before I saw him\r\nwhen he came here before."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, poor fellow! Between you and me, Kate might have had\r\nhim if she liked; but perhaps Kate was right."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he would have suited Kate at all."\r\n\r\n"Because of the farmyard, you mean? Kate shouldn\'t give herself airs.\r\nMoney\'s never dirty, you know. But perhaps it\'s all for the best.\r\nThere\'s a sweet girl here to whom he is violently attached, and who I\r\nhope will become Mrs. Cheesacre. But as I was saying, the friendship\r\nbetween these two men is quite wonderful, and I have always observed\r\nthat when a man can create that kind of affection in the bosom of\r\nanother man, he invariably is,--the sort of man,--the man, in fact,\r\nwho makes a good husband."\r\n\r\nAlice knew the story of Charlie Fairstairs and her hopes; knew of\r\nthe quarrels between Bellfield and Cheesacre; knew almost as much of\r\nBellfield\'s past life as Mrs. Greenow did herself; and Mrs. Greenow\r\nwas no doubt aware that such was the case. Nevertheless, she had a\r\npleasure in telling her own story, and told it as though she believed\r\nevery word that she spoke.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the two gentlemen came over, according to\r\ncustom, and Alice observed that Miss Fairstairs hardly spoke to Mr.\r\nCheesacre. Indeed her manner of avoiding that gentleman was so very\r\nmarked, that it was impossible not to observe it. They drank tea out\r\nof doors, and when Mr. Cheesacre on one occasion sauntered across\r\ntowards the end of the bench on which Charlie was sitting, Charlie\r\ngot up and walked away. And in strolling about the place afterwards,\r\nand in going up through the wood, she was at great pains to attach\r\nherself to some other person, so that there should be no such\r\nattaching between her and the owner of Oileymead. At one time Mr.\r\nCheesacre did get close up to her and spoke some word, some very\r\nindifferent word. He knew that he was being cut and he wanted to\r\navoid the appearance of a scene. "I don\'t know, sir," said Charlie,\r\nagain moving away with excellent dignity, and she at once attached\r\nherself to Alice who was close by. "I know you have just come home\r\nfrom Switzerland," said Charlie. "Beautiful Switzerland! My heart\r\npants for Switzerland. Do tell me something about Switzerland!" Mr.\r\nCheesacre had heard that Alice was the dear friend of a lady who\r\nwould probably some day become a duchess. He therefore naturally\r\nheld her in awe, and slunk away. On this occasion Mrs. Greenow clung\r\nlovingly to her future husband, and the effect was that Mr. Cheesacre\r\nfound himself to be very much alone and unhappy. He had generally\r\nenjoyed these days at Vavasor Hall, having found himself, or fancied\r\nhimself, to be the dominant spirit there. That Mrs. Greenow was always\r\nin truth the dominant spirit I need hardly say; but she knew how to\r\nmake a companion happy, and well also how to make him wretched. On\r\nthe whole of this day poor Cheesacre was very wretched.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall go there any more," he said to Bellfield, as\r\nhe drove the gig back to Penrith that evening.\r\n\r\n"Not go there any more, Cheesy," said Bellfield; "why, we are to have\r\nthe dinner out in the field on Friday. It\'s your own bespeak."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I\'ll go on Friday, but not after that."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll stop and see me turned off, old fellow?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use? You\'ll get your wife, and that\'s enough for you. The\r\ntruth is, that since that girl came down from London with her d----d\r\nairs;"--the girl from London with the airs was poor Alice,--"the\r\nplace is quite changed. I\'m blessed if the whole thing isn\'t as dark\r\nas ditch-water. I\'m a plain man, I am; and I do hate your swells."\r\nAgainst this view of the case Captain Bellfield argued stoutly; but\r\nCheesacre had been offended, and throughout the next day he was cross\r\nand touchy. He wouldn\'t play billiards, and on one occasion hinted\r\nthat he hoped he should get that money soon.\r\n\r\n"You did it admirably, my dear," said Mrs. Greenow that night\r\nto Charlie Fairstairs. The widow was now on terms almost more\r\nconfidential with Miss Fairstairs than with her own niece, Kate\r\nVavasor. She loved a little bit of intrigue; and though Kate could\r\nintrigue, as we have seen in this story, Kate would not join her\r\naunt\'s intrigues. "You did it admirably. I really did not think you\r\nhad so much in you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said Charlie, blushing at the praise.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s the only way, my dear;--the only way, I mean, for you with\r\nsuch a one as him. And if he does come round, you\'ll find him an\r\nexcellent husband."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he cares for me a bit," said Charlie whimpering.\r\n\r\n"Pooh, nonsense! Girls never know whether men care for them or not.\r\nIf he asks you to marry him, won\'t that be a sign that he cares for\r\nyou? and if he don\'t, why, there\'ll be no harm done."\r\n\r\n"If he thinks it\'s his money--" began Charlie.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t talk nonsense, Charlie," said Mrs. Greenow, "or you\'ll\r\nmake me sick. Of course it\'s his money, more or less. You don\'t\r\nmean to tell me you\'d go and fall in love with him if he was like\r\nBellfield, and hadn\'t got a rap? I can afford that sort of thing; you\r\ncan\'t. I don\'t mean to say you ain\'t to love him. Of course, you\'re\r\nto love him; and I\'ve no doubt you will, and make him a very good\r\nwife. I always think that worldliness and sentimentality are like\r\nbrandy-and-water. I don\'t like either of them separately, but taken\r\ntogether they make a very nice drink. I like them warm, with ---- as\r\nthe gentlemen say." To this little lecture Miss Fairstairs listened\r\nwith dutiful patience, and when it was over she said nothing more\r\nof her outraged affections or of her disregard for money. "And\r\nnow, my dear, mind you look your best on Friday. I\'ll get him away\r\nimmediately after dinner, and when he\'s done with me you can contrive\r\nto be in his way, you know."\r\n\r\nThe next day was what Kate called the blank day at the Hall. The\r\nladies were all alone, and devoted themselves, as was always the case\r\non the blank days, to millinery and household cares. Mrs. Greenow,\r\nas has before been stated, had taken a lease of the place, and her\r\ntroubles extended beyond her mere bridal wardrobe. Large trunks of\r\nhousehold linen had arrived, and all this linen was marked with the\r\nname of Greenow; Greenow, 5.58; Greenow, 7.52; and a good deal had\r\nto be done before this ancient wealth of housewifery could probably\r\nbe converted to Bellfield purposes. "We must cut out the pieces,\r\nJeannette, and work \'em in again ever so carefully," said the widow,\r\nafter some painful consideration. "It will always show," said\r\nJeannette, shaking her head. "But the other would show worse," said\r\nthe widow; "and if you finedraw it, not one person in ten will notice\r\nit. We\'d always put them on with the name to the feet, you know."\r\n\r\nIt was not quite true that Cheesacre had bespoke the dinner out in\r\nthe field, although no doubt he thought he had done so. The little\r\ntreat, if treat it was, had all been arranged by Mrs. Greenow, who\r\nwas ever ready to create festivities. There was not much scope for\r\na picnic here. Besides their own party, which, of course, included\r\nthe Captain and Mr. Cheesacre, no guest could be caught except the\r\nclergyman;--that low-church clergyman, who was so anxious about his\r\nincome, and with whom the old Squire had quarrelled. Mrs. Greenow\r\nhad quickly obtained the advantage of his alliance, and he, who was\r\nsoon to perform on her behalf the marriage ceremony, had promised\r\nto grace this little festival. The affair simply amounted to this,\r\nthat they were to eat their dinner uncomfortably in the field\r\ninstead of comfortably in the dining-room. But Mrs. Greenow knew that\r\nCharlie\'s charms would be much strengthened by a dinner out-of-doors.\r\n"Nothing," she said to Kate, "nothing makes a man come forward so\r\nwell as putting him altogether out of his usual tack. A man who\r\nwouldn\'t think of such a thing in the drawing-room would be sure to\r\nmake an offer if he spent an evening with a young lady down-stairs in\r\nthe kitchen."\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock the gig from Penrith arrived at the Hall, and for\r\nthe next hour both Cheesacre and the Captain were engaged in\r\npreparing the tables and carrying out the viands. The Captain and\r\nCharlie Fairstairs were going to lay the cloth. "Let me do it," said\r\nCheesacre taking it out of the Captain\'s hands. "Oh, certainly," said\r\nthe Captain, giving up his prize. "Captain Bellfield would do it much\r\nbetter," said Charlie, with a little toss of her head; "he\'s as good\r\nas a married man, and they always do these things best."\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, and although the shade was not perfect, and the\r\nmidges were troublesome, the dinner went off very nicely. It was\r\nbeautiful to see how well Mrs. Greenow remembered herself about the\r\ngrace, seeing that the clergyman was there. She was just in time, and\r\nwould have been very angry with herself, and have thought herself\r\nawkward, had she forgotten it. Mr. Cheesacre sat on her right hand,\r\nand the clergyman on her left, and she hardly spoke a word to\r\nBellfield. Her sweetest smiles were all given to Cheesacre. She was\r\nspecially anxious to keep her neighbour, the parson, in good-humour,\r\nand therefore illuminated him once in every five minutes with a\r\npassing ray, but the full splendour of her light was poured out upon\r\nCheesacre, as it never had before been poured. How she did flatter\r\nhim, and with what a capacious gullet did he swallow her flatteries!\r\nOileymead was the only paradise she had ever seen. "Ah, me; when I\r\nthink of it sometimes,--but never mind." A moment came to him when he\r\nthought that even yet he might win the race, and send Bellfield away\r\nhowling into outer darkness. A moment came to him, and the widow saw\r\nthe moment well. "I know I have done for the best," said she, "and\r\ntherefore I shall never regret it; at any rate, it\'s done now."\r\n\r\n"Not done yet," said he plaintively.\r\n\r\n"Yes; done, and done, and done. Besides, a man in your position in\r\nthe county should always marry a wife younger than yourself,--a good\r\ndeal younger." Cheesacre did not understand the argument, but he\r\nliked the allusion to his position in the county, and he perceived\r\nthat it was too late for any changes in the present arrangements. But\r\nhe was happy; and all that feeling of animosity to Alice had vanished\r\nfrom his breast. Poor Alice! she, at any rate, was innocent. With so\r\nmuch of her own to fill her mind, she had been but little able to\r\ntake her share in the Greenow festivities; and we may safely say,\r\nthat if Mr. Cheesacre\'s supremacy was on any occasion attacked, it\r\nwas not attacked by her. His supremacy on this occasion was paramount,\r\nand during the dinner, and after the dinner, he was allowed to\r\ngive his orders to Bellfield in a manner that must have gratified\r\nhim much. "You must have another glass of champagne with me, my\r\nfriend," said Mrs. Greenow; and Mr. Cheesacre drank the other glass of\r\nchampagne. It was not the second nor the third that he had taken.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they started off for a ramble through the fields, and\r\nMrs. Greenow and Mr. Cheesacre were together. I think that Charlie\r\nFairstairs did not go with them at all. I think she went into the\r\nhouse and washed her face, and brushed her hair, and settled her\r\nmuslin. I should not wonder if she took off her frock and ironed it\r\nagain. Captain Bellfield, I know, went with Alice, and created some\r\nastonishment by assuring her that he fully meant to correct the error\r\nof his ways. "I know what it is," he said, "to be connected with such\r\na family as yours, Miss Vavasor." He too had heard about the future\r\nduchess, and wished to be on his best behaviour. Kate fell to the lot\r\nof the parson.\r\n\r\n"This is the last time we shall ever be together in this way," said\r\nthe widow to her friend.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Cheesacre; "I hope not."\r\n\r\n"The last time. On Wednesday I become Mrs. Bellfield, and I need\r\nhardly say that I have many things to think of before that; but Mr.\r\nCheesacre, I hope we are not to be strangers hereafter?" Mr. Cheesacre\r\nsaid that he hoped not. Oileymead would always be open to Captain and\r\nMrs. Bellfield.\r\n\r\n"We all know your hospitality," said she; "it is not to-day nor\r\nto-morrow that I or my husband,--that is to be,--will have to learn\r\nthat. He always declares that you are the very beau ideal of an\r\nEnglish country gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Merely a poor Norfolk farmer," said Cheesacre. "I never want to\r\nput myself beyond my own place. There has been some talk about the\r\nCommission of the Peace, but I don\'t think anything of it."\r\n\r\n"It has been the greatest blessing in the world for him that he has\r\never known you," said Mrs. Greenow, still talking about her future\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve tried to be good-natured; that\'s all. D---- me, Mrs. Greenow,\r\nwhat\'s the use of living if one doesn\'t try to be good-natured? There\r\nisn\'t a better fellow than Bellfield living. He and I ran for the\r\nsame plate, and he has won it. He\'s a lucky fellow, and I don\'t\r\nbegrudge him his luck."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so manly of you, Mr. Cheesacre! But, indeed, the plate you\r\nspeak of was not worth your running for."\r\n\r\n"I may have my own opinion about that, you know."\r\n\r\n"It was not. Nobody knows that as well as I do, or could have thought\r\nover the whole matter so often. I know very well what my mission is\r\nin life. The mistress of your house, Mr. Cheesacre, should not be any\r\nman\'s widow."\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t be a widow then, you know."\r\n\r\n"A virgin heart should be yours; and a virgin heart may be yours, if\r\nyou choose to accept it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!"\r\n\r\n"If you choose to take my solicitude on your behalf in that way, of\r\ncourse I have done. You were good enough to say just now that you\r\nwished to see me and my husband in your hospitable halls. After all\r\nthat has passed, do you think that I could be a visitor at your house\r\nunless there is a mistress there?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I think you might."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Cheesacre; certainly not. For all our sakes, I should\r\ndecline. But if you were married--"\r\n\r\n"You are always wanting to marry me, Mrs. Greenow."\r\n\r\n"I do, I do. It is the only way in which there can be any friendship\r\nbetween us, and not for worlds would I lose that advantage for my\r\nhusband,--let alone what I may feel for myself."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you take me yourself, Mrs. Greenow?"\r\n\r\n"If you can\'t understand, it is not for me to say anything more, Mr.\r\nCheesacre. If you value the warm affection of a virgin heart--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mrs. Greenow, all yesterday she wouldn\'t say a word to me."\r\n\r\n"Not say a word to you? Is that all you know about it? Are you so\r\nignorant that you cannot see when a girl\'s heart is breaking beneath\r\nher stays?" This almost improper allusion had quite an effect on Mr.\r\nCheesacre\'s sensitive bosom. "Did you say a word to her yesterday?\r\nAnd if not, why have you said so many words before?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Greenow; come!"\r\n\r\n"It is, oh, Mrs. Greenow. But it is time that we should go back\r\nto them." They had been sitting all this time on a bank, under a\r\nhedge. "We will have our tea, and you shall have your pipe and\r\nbrandy-and-water, and Charlie shall bring it to you. Shall she, Mr.\r\nCheesacre?"\r\n\r\n"If she likes she shall, of course."\r\n\r\n"Do you ask her, and she\'ll like it it quick enough. But remember,\r\nMr. Cheesacre, I\'m quite serious in what I say about your having a\r\nmistress for your house. Only think what an age you\'ll be when your\r\nchildren grow up, if you don\'t marry soon now."\r\n\r\nThey returned to the field in which they had dined, and found Charlie\r\nunder the trees, with her muslin looking very fresh. "What, all\r\na-mort?" said Mrs. Greenow. Charlie did not quite understand this, but\r\nreplied that she preferred being alone. "I have told him that you\r\nshould fill his pipe for him," said Mrs. Greenow. "He doesn\'t care for\r\nladies to fill his pipe for him," said Charlie. "Do you try," said\r\nthe widow, "while I go indoors and order the tea."\r\n\r\nIt had been necessary to put the bait very close before Cheesacre\'s\r\neyes, or there would have been no hope that he might take it. The\r\nbait had been put so very close that we must feel sure that he saw\r\nthe hook. But there are fish so silly that they will take the bait\r\nalthough they know the hook is there. Cheesacre understood it all.\r\nMany things he could not see, but he could see that Mrs. Greenow\r\nwas trying to catch him as a husband for Charlie Fairstairs; and he\r\nknew also that he had always despised Charlie, and that no worldly\r\nadvantage whatever would accrue to him by a marriage with such a\r\ngirl. But there she was, and he didn\'t quite know how to avoid it.\r\nShe did look rather nice in her clear-starched muslin frock, and he\r\nfelt that he should like to kiss her. He needn\'t marry her because\r\nhe kissed her. The champagne which had created the desire also gave\r\nhim the audacity. He gave one glance around him to see that he was\r\nnot observed, and then he did kiss Charlie Fairstairs under the\r\ntrees. "Oh, Mr. Cheesacre," said Charlie. "Oh, Mr. Cheesacre," echoed\r\na laughing voice; and poor Cheesacre, looking round, saw that Mrs.\r\nGreenow, who ought to have been inside the house looking after the\r\nboiling water, was moving about for some unknown reason within sight\r\nof the spot which he had chosen for his dalliance.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cheesacre," said Charlie sobbing, "how dare you do that?--and\r\nwhere all the world could see you?"\r\n\r\n"It was only Mrs. Greenow," said Cheesacre.\r\n\r\n"And what will she think of me?"\r\n\r\n"Lord bless you--she won\'t think anything about it."\r\n\r\n"But I do;--I think a great deal about it. I don\'t know what to do,\r\nI don\'t;--I don\'t." Whereupon Charlie got up from her seat under the\r\ntrees and began to move away slowly. Cheesacre thought about it for\r\na moment or two. Should he follow her or should he not? He knew that\r\nhe had better not follow her. He knew that she was bait with a very\r\nvisible hook. He knew that he was a big fish for whom these two women\r\nwere angling. But after all, perhaps it wouldn\'t do him much harm to\r\nbe caught. So he got up and followed her. I don\'t suppose she meant\r\nto take the way towards the woods,--towards the little path leading\r\nto the old summer-house up in the trees. She was too much beside\r\nherself to know where she was going, no doubt. But that was the\r\npath she did take, and before long she and Cheesacre were in the\r\nsummerhouse together. "Don\'t, Sam, don\'t! Somebody really will be\r\ncoming. Well, then, there. Now I won\'t do it again." \'Twas thus she\r\nspoke when the last kiss was given on this occasion;--unless there\r\nmay have been one or two later in the evening, to which it is not\r\nnecessary more especially to allude here. But on the occasion of that\r\nlast kiss in the summer-house Miss Fairstairs was perfectly justified\r\nby circumstances, for she was then the promised bride of Mr.\r\nCheesacre.\r\n\r\nBut how was he to get down again among his friends? That\r\nconsideration troubled Mr. Cheesacre as he rose from his happy seat\r\nafter that last embrace. He had promised Charlie, and perhaps he\r\nwould keep his promise, but it might be as well not to make it all\r\ntoo public at once. But Charlie wasn\'t going to be thrown over;--not\r\nif she knew it, as she said to herself. She returned therefore\r\ntriumphantly among them all,--blushing indeed, and with her eyes\r\nturned away, and her hand now remained upon her lover\'s arm;--but\r\nstill so close to him that there could be no mistake. "Goodness,\r\ngracious, Charlie! where have you and Mr. Cheesacre been?" said Mrs.\r\nGreenow. "We got up into the woods and lost ourselves," said Charlie.\r\n"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Greenow.\r\n\r\nIt would be too long to tell now, in these last pages of our story,\r\nhow Cheesacre strove to escape, and with what skill Mrs. Greenow kept\r\nhim to his bargain. I hope that Charlie Fairstairs was duly grateful.\r\nBefore that evening was over, under the comfortable influence of\r\na glass of hot brandy-and-water,--the widow had, I think, herself\r\nmixed the second glass for Mr. Cheesacre, before the influence became\r\nsufficiently comfortable,--he was forced to own that he had made\r\nhimself the happy possessor of Charlie Fairstairs\' heart and hand.\r\n"And you are a lucky man," said the widow with enthusiasm; "and I\r\ncongratulate you with all my heart. Don\'t let there be any delay now,\r\nbecause a good thing can\'t be done too soon." And indeed, before\r\nthat night was over, Mrs. Greenow had the pair together in her own\r\npresence, and then fixed the day. "A fellow ought to be allowed to\r\nturn himself," Cheesacre said to her, pleading for himself in a\r\nwhisper. But no; Mrs. Greenow would give him no such mercy. She knew\r\nto what a man turning himself might probably lead. She was a woman\r\nwho was quite in earnest when she went to work, and I hope that\r\nMiss Fairstairs was grateful. Then, in that presence, was in truth\r\nthe last kiss given on that eventful evening. "Come, Charlie, be\r\ngood-natured to him. He\'s as good as your own now," said the widow.\r\nAnd Charlie was good-natured. "It\'s to be as soon as ever we come\r\nback from our trip," said Mrs. Greenow to Kate, the next day, "and\r\nI\'m lending her money to get all her things at once. He shall come to\r\nthe scratch, though I go all the way to Norfolk by myself and fetch\r\nhim by his ears. He shall come, as sure as my name\'s Greenow,--or\r\nBellfield, as it will be then, you know."\r\n\r\n"And I shouldn\'t wonder if she did have to go to Norfolk," said Kate\r\nto her cousin. That event, however, cannot be absolutely concluded in\r\nthese pages. I can only say that, when I think of Mrs. Greenow\'s force\r\nof character and warmth of friendship, I feel that Miss Fairstairs\'\r\nprospects stand on good ground.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenow\'s own marriage was completed with perfect success. She\r\ntook Captain Bellfield for better or for worse, with a thorough\r\ndetermination to make the best of his worst, and to put him on his\r\nlegs, if any such putting might be possible. He, at any rate, had\r\nbeen in luck. If any possible stroke of fortune could do him good, he\r\nhad found that stroke. He had found a wife who could forgive all his\r\npast offences,--and also, if necessary, some future offences; who\r\nhad money enough for all his wants, and kindness enough to gratify\r\nthem, and who had, moreover,--which for the Captain was the most\r\nimportant,--strength enough to keep from him the power of ruining\r\nthem both. Reader, let us wish a happy married life to Captain and\r\nMrs. Bellfield!\r\n\r\nThe day after the ceremony Alice Vavasor and Kate Vavasor started for\r\nMatching Priory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nDiamonds Are Diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate and Alice, as they drew near to their journey\'s end, were both\r\na little flurried, and I cannot but own that there was cause for\r\nnervousness. Kate Vavasor was to meet Mr. Grey for the first time. Mr.\r\nGrey was now staying at Matching and was to remain there until a week\r\nof his marriage. He was then to return to Cambridgeshire for a day\r\nor two, and after that was to become a guest at the rector\'s house\r\nat Matching the evening before the ceremony. "Why not let him come\r\nhere at once?" Lady Glencora had said to her husband. "It is such\r\nnonsense, you know." But Mr. Palliser would not hear of it. Mr.\r\nPalliser, though a Radical in public life, would not for worlds\r\ntransgress the social laws of his ancestors; and so the matter was\r\nsettled. Kate on this very day of her arrival at Matching would thus\r\nsee Mr. Grey for the first time, and she could not but feel that she\r\nhad been the means of doing Mr. Grey much injury. She had moreover\r\nsomething,--not much indeed, but still something,--of that feeling\r\nwhich made the Pallisers terrible to the imagination, because of\r\ntheir rank and wealth. She was a little afraid of the Pallisers, but\r\nof Mr. Grey she was very much afraid. And Alice also was not at her\r\nease. She would fain have prevented so very quick a marriage had she\r\nnot felt that now,--after all the trouble that she had caused,--there\r\nwas nothing left for her but to do as others wished. When a day\r\nhad been named she had hardly dared to demur, and had allowed Lady\r\nGlencora to settle everything as she had wished. But it was not\r\nonly the suddenness of her marriage which dismayed her. Its nature\r\nand attributes were terrible to her. Both Lady Midlothian and the\r\nMarchioness of Auld Reekie were coming. When this was told to her by\r\nletter she had no means of escape. "Lady Macleod is right in nearly\r\nall that she says," Lady Glencora had written to her. "At any rate,\r\nyou needn\'t be such a fool as to run away from your cousins, simply\r\nbecause they have handles to their names. You must take the thing\r\nas it comes." Lady Glencora, moreover, had settled for her the list\r\nof bridesmaids. Alice had made a petition that she might be allowed\r\nto go through the ceremony with only one,--with none but Kate to\r\nback her. But she ought to have known that when she consented to be\r\nmarried at Matching,--and indeed she had had very little power of\r\nresisting that proposition,--all such questions would be decided for\r\nher. Two daughters therefore of Lady Midlothian were to act, Lady\r\nJane and Lady Mary, and the one daughter of the Marchioness, who was\r\nalso a Lady Jane, and there were to be two Miss Howards down from\r\nLondon,--girls who were known both to Alice and to Lady Glencora,\r\nand who were in some distant way connected with them both. A great\r\nattempt was made to induce the two Miss Pallisers to join the bevy,\r\nbut they had frankly pleaded their age. "No woman should stand up as\r\na bridesmaid," said the strong-minded Sophy, "who doesn\'t mean to get\r\nmarried if she can. Now I don\'t mean to get married, and I won\'t put\r\nmyself among the young people." Lady Glencora was therefore obliged\r\nto submit to do the work with only six. But she swore that they\r\nshould be very smart. She was to give all the dresses, and Mr.\r\nPalliser was to give a brooch and an armlet to each. "She is the only\r\nperson in the world I want to pet, except yourself," Lady Glencora\r\nhad said to her husband, and he had answered by giving her _carte\r\nblanche_ as regards expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alice and her bridesmaids.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was very terrible to Kate, who had not much feminine taste\r\nfor finery. Of the dress she had heard,--of the dress which was\r\nwaiting at Matching to be made up after her arrival,--though as yet\r\nshe knew nothing of the trinkets. There are many girls who could\r\nsubmit themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as Lady\r\nGlencora. Perhaps most girls would do so, for of all such women in\r\nthe world, Lady Glencora was the least inclined to patronize or to\r\nbe condescending in her kindnesses. But Kate Vavasor was one to whom\r\nsuch submission would not come easily.\r\n\r\n"I wish I was out of this boat," she said to Alice in the train.\r\n\r\n"So that I might be shipwrecked alone!"\r\n\r\n"No; there can be no shipwreck to you. When the day of action comes\r\nyou will be taken away, up to heaven, upon the clouds. But what are\r\nthey to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find that Glencora will not desert you. You can\'t conceive\r\nwhat taste she has."\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner be bridesmaid to Charlie Fairstairs. I would indeed.\r\nMy place in the world is not among Cabinet Ministers and old\r\ncountesses."\r\n\r\n"Nor mine."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it seems that yours is to be there. They are your cousins, and\r\nyou have made at any rate one great friend among them,--one who is to\r\nbe the biggest of them all."\r\n\r\n"And you are going to throw me over, Kate?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, Alice, I sometimes think you had better throw me\r\nover. I know it would be sad,--sad for both, but perhaps it would be\r\nbetter. I have done you much harm and no good; and now where I am\r\ngoing I shall disgrace you." She talked even of getting out at some\r\nstation and returning, and would have done so had not Alice made\r\nit impossible. As it was, the evening found her and Alice together\r\nentering the park-gate at Matching, in Lady Glencora\'s carriage.\r\nLady Glencora had sent a note to the station. "She could not come\r\nherself," she said, "because Mr. Palliser was a little fussy. You\'ll\r\nunderstand, dear, but don\'t say a word." Alice didn\'t say a word,\r\nhaving been very anxious not to lower Mr. Palliser in her cousin\'s\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nNone of the Lady Janes and Lady Marys were at Matching when they\r\narrived. Indeed, there was no guest there but Mr. Grey, for which Kate\r\nfelt herself to be extremely grateful. Mr. Grey came into the hall,\r\nstanding behind Mr. Palliser, who stood behind his wife. Alice passed\r\nby them both, and was at once in her lover\'s arms. "Then I must\r\nintroduce myself," said Lady Glencora to Kate, "and my husband also."\r\nThis she did, and no woman in England could have excelled her in\r\nthe manner of doing it. "I have heard so much about you," said she,\r\nstill keeping Kate\'s hand, "and I know how good you\'ve been;--and\r\nhow wicked you have been," she added in a whisper. Then Mr. Grey was\r\nbrought up to her, and they were introduced. It was not till some\r\ndays had passed over them that she felt herself at all at her ease\r\nwith Mr. Grey, and I doubt whether she ever reached that point with Mr.\r\nPalliser; but Lady Glencora she knew, and liked, and almost loved,\r\nfrom the first moment of their meeting.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard the news?" said Lady Glencora to Alice, the first\r\nminute that they were alone. Alice, of course, had not heard the\r\nnews. "Mr. Bott is going to marry Mrs. Marsham. There is such a row\r\nabout it. Plantagenet is nearly mad. I never knew him so disgusted in\r\nmy life. Of course I don\'t dare to tell him so, but I am so heartily\r\nrejoiced. You know how I love them both, and I could not possibly\r\nwish any better reward for either." Alice, who had personally known\r\nmore of Mr. Bott than of Mrs. Marsham, said that she couldn\'t but be\r\nsorry for the lady. "She\'s old enough to be his mother," said Lady\r\nGlencora, "otherwise I really don\'t know any people better suited\r\nto each other. The best is, that Mr. Bott is doing it to regain his\r\nfooting with Mr. Palliser! I am sure of that;--and Plantagenet will\r\nnever speak to him again. But, Alice, there is other news."\r\n\r\n"What other news?"\r\n\r\n"It is hardly news yet, and of course I am very wicked to tell you.\r\nBut I feel sure Mr. Grey knows all about it, and if I didn\'t tell, he\r\nwould."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t told me anything yet."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t had time; and when he does, you mustn\'t pretend to know.\r\nI believe Mr. Palliser will certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nbefore next month, and, if so, he\'ll never come in for Silverbridge\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll be in Parliament; will he not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; he\'ll be in Parliament. I don\'t understand all about it.\r\nThere is a man going out for the county,--for Barsetshire,--some man\r\nwhom the Duke used to favour, and he wants Plantagenet to come in for\r\nthat. I can\'t understand what difference it makes."\r\n\r\n"But he will be in the Cabinet?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. But who do you suppose is to be the new Member for\r\nSilverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t guess," said Alice. Though, of course, she did guess.\r\n\r\n"Mind, I don\'t know it. He has never told me. But he told me that\r\nhe had been with the Duke, and asked the Duke to let Jeffrey have\r\nthe seat. The Duke became as black as thunder, and said that Jeffrey\r\nhad no fortune. In short, he wouldn\'t hear of it. Poor Jeffrey!\r\nwe must try to do something for him, but I really don\'t know how.\r\nThen the Duke said, that Plantagenet should put in for Silverbridge\r\nsome friend who would support himself; and I fancy,--mind it\'s only\r\nfancy,--but I fancy that Plantagenet mentioned to his Grace--one Mr.\r\nGrey."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been talking together till sometimes I think Mr. Grey is\r\nworse than Plantagenet. When Mr. Grey began to say something the other\r\nnight in the drawing-room about sugar, I knew it was all up with you.\r\nHe\'ll be a financial Secretary; you see if he isn\'t; or a lord of\r\nsomething, or an under-somebody of State; and then some day he\'ll\r\ngo mad, either because he does or because he doesn\'t get into the\r\nCabinet." Lady Glencora, as she said all this, knew well that the\r\nnews she was giving would please her cousin better than any other\r\ntidings that could be told.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the guests came. The two Miss Howards were the first, and\r\nthey expressed themselves as delighted with Lady Glencora\'s taste\r\nand with Mr. Palliser\'s munificence,--for at that time the brooches\r\nand armlets had been produced. Kate had said very little about\r\nthese matters, but the Miss Howards were loud in their thanks. But\r\nthey were good-humoured, merry girls, and the house was pleasanter\r\nafter their arrival than it had been before. Then came the dreaded\r\npersonage,--the guest,--Lady Midlothian! On the subject of Lady\r\nMidlothian Kate had really become curious. She had a real desire\r\nto see the face and gait of the woman, and to hear her voice. Lady\r\nMidlothian came, and with her came Lady Jane and Lady Mary. I am by\r\nno means sure that Lady Jane and Lady Mary were not nearly as old as\r\nthe two Miss Pallisers; but they were not probably so fully resolved\r\nas to the condition of their future modes of living as were those two\r\nladies, and if so, they were not wrong to shine as bridesmaids. With\r\nthem Alice had made some slight acquaintance during the last spring\r\nin London, and as they were now to attend upon her as the bride they\r\nwere sufficiently gracious. To Kate, too, they were civil enough, and\r\nthings, in public, went on very pleasantly at Matching.\r\n\r\nA scene there was, of course, between Alice and Lady Midlothian;--a\r\nscene in private. "You must go through it," Lady Glencora had said,\r\nwith jocose mournfulness; "and why should you not let her jump upon\r\nyou a little? It can\'t hurt you now."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t like people to jump upon me," Alice said.\r\n\r\n"And why are you to have everything just as you like it? You are so\r\nunreasonable. Think how I\'ve been jumped on! Think what I have borne\r\nfrom them! If you knew the things she used to say to me, you would\r\nnot be such a coward. I was sent down to her for a week, and had no\r\npower of helping myself. And the Marchioness used to be sent for to\r\nlook at me, for she never talks. She used to look at me, and groan,\r\nand hold up her hands till I hated her the worst of the two. Think\r\nwhat they did to me, and yet they are my dear friends now. Why should\r\nyou escape altogether?"\r\n\r\nAlice could not escape altogether, and therefore was closeted with\r\nLady Midlothian for the best part of an hour. "Did Lady Macleod read\r\nto you what I wrote?" the Countess asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--that is, she gave me the letter to read."\r\n\r\n"And I hope you understand me, Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"You suppose so, my dear! If you only suppose so I shall not\r\nbe contented. I want you to appreciate my feelings towards you\r\nthoroughly. I want you to know that I am most anxious as to your\r\nfuture life, and that I am thoroughly satisfied with the step you are\r\nnow taking." The Countess paused, but Alice said nothing. Her tongue\r\nwas itching to tell the old woman that she cared nothing for this\r\nexpression of satisfaction; but she was aware that she had done much\r\nthat was deserving of punishment, and resolved to take this as part\r\nof her penance. She was being jumped upon, and it was unpleasant;\r\nbut, after all that had happened, it was only fitting that she should\r\nundergo much unpleasantness. "Thoroughly satisfied," continued the\r\nCountess; "and now, I only wish to refer, in the slightest manner\r\npossible, to what took place between us when we were both of us under\r\nthis roof last winter."\r\n\r\n"Why refer to it at all, Lady Midlothian?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think it may do good, and because I cannot make you\r\nunderstand that I have thoroughly forgiven everything, unless I tell\r\nyou that I have forgiven that also. On that occasion I had come all\r\nthe way from Scotland on purpose to say a few words to you."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry that you should have had the trouble."\r\n\r\n"I do not regret it, Alice. I never do regret doing anything which\r\nI believe to have been my duty. There is no knowing how far what I\r\nsaid then may have operated for good." Alice thought that she knew\r\nvery well, but she said nothing. "I must confess that what I then\r\nunderstood to be your obstinacy,--and I must say also, if I tell the\r\ntruth, your indifference to--to--to all prudential considerations\r\nwhatever, not to talk of appearances and decorum, and I might say,\r\nanything like a high line of duty or moral conduct,--shocked me\r\nvery much. It did, indeed, my dear. Taking it altogether, I don\'t\r\nknow that I was ever more shocked in my life. The thing was so\r\ninscrutable!" Here Lady Midlothian held up one hand in a manner that\r\nwas truly imposing; "so inscrutable! But that is all over now. What\r\nwas personally offensive to myself I could easily forgive, and I do\r\nforgive it. I shall never think of it any more." Here Lady Midlothian\r\nput up both her hands gently, as though wafting the injury away into\r\nthe air. "But what I wish specially to say to you is this; your own\r\nconduct is forgiven also!" Here she paused again, and Alice winced.\r\nWho was this dreadful old Countess;--what was the Countess to her,\r\nthat she should be thus tormented with the old woman\'s forgiveness?\r\nJohn Grey had forgiven her, and of external forgiveness that was\r\nenough. She had not forgiven herself,--would never forgive herself\r\naltogether; and the pardon of no old woman in England could assist\r\nher in doing so. She had sinned, but she had not sinned against Lady\r\nMidlothian. "Let her jump upon you, and have done with it," Lady\r\nGlencora had said. She had resolved that it should be so, but it was\r\nvery hard to keep her resolution.\r\n\r\n"The Marchioness and I have talked it over," continued Lady\r\nMidlothian, "and she has asked me to speak for both her and myself."\r\nThere is comfort at any rate in that, thought Alice, who had never\r\nyet seen the Marchioness. "We have resolved that all those little\r\nmistakes should be as though they had never been committed. We shall\r\nboth be most happy to receive you and your husband, who is, I must\r\nsay, one of the most gentlemanlike looking men I ever saw. It seems\r\nthat he and Mr. Palliser are on most friendly,--I may say, most\r\nconfidential terms, and that must be quite a pleasure to you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pleasure to him, which is more to the purpose," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so. And now, my dear, everything is forgiven and shall be\r\nforgotten. Come and give me a kiss, and let me wish you joy." Alice\r\ndid as she was bidden, and accepted the kiss and the congratulations,\r\nand a little box of jewellery which Lady Midlothian produced from out\r\nof her pocket. "The diamonds are from the Marchioness, my dear, whose\r\nmeans, as you doubtless are aware, greatly exceed my own. The garnets\r\nare from me. I hope they may both be worn long and happily."\r\n\r\nI hardly know which was the worst, the lecture, the kiss, or the\r\npresent. The latter she would have declined, had it been possible;\r\nbut it was not possible. When she had agreed to be married at\r\nMatching she had not calculated the amount of punishment which would\r\nthereby be inflicted on her. But I think that, though she bore it\r\nimpatiently, she was aware that she had deserved it. Although she\r\nfretted herself greatly under the infliction of Lady Midlothian, she\r\nacknowledged to herself, even at the time, that she deserved all\r\nthe lashes she received. She had made a fool of herself in her vain\r\nattempt to be greater and grander than other girls, and it was only\r\nfair that her folly should be in some sort punished before it was\r\nfully pardoned. John Grey punished it after one fashion; by declining\r\nto allude to it, or to think of it, or to take any account of it. And\r\nnow Lady Midlothian had punished it after another fashion, and Alice\r\nwent out of the Countess\'s presence with sundry inward exclamations\r\nof "mea culpa," and with many unseen beatings of the breast.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the ceremony came the Marchioness and her august\r\ndaughter. Her Lady Jane was much more august than the other Lady\r\nJane;--very much more august indeed. She had very long flaxen hair,\r\nand very light blue eyes, which she did not move frequently, and she\r\nspoke very little,--one may almost say not at all, and she never\r\nseemed to do anything. But she was very august, and was, as all the\r\nworld knew, engaged to marry the Duke of Dumfriesshire, who, though\r\ntwice her own age, was as yet childless, as soon as he should have\r\ncompleted his mourning for his first wife. Kate told her cousin that\r\nshe did not at all know how she should ever stand up as one in a\r\ngroup with so august a person as this Lady Jane, and Alice herself\r\nfelt that such an attendant would quite obliterate her. But Lady Jane\r\nand her mother were both harmless. The Marchioness never spoke to\r\nKate and hardly spoke to Alice, and the Marchioness\'s Lady Jane was\r\nquite as silent as her mother.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of this day,--the day on which these very august\r\npeople came,--a telegram arrived at the Priory calling for Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s immediate presence in London. He came to Alice full of\r\nregret, and behaved himself very nicely. Alice now regarded him quite\r\nas a friend. "Of course I understand," she said, "and I know that the\r\nbusiness which takes you up to London pleases you." "Well; yes;--it\r\ndoes please me. I am glad,--I don\'t mind saying so to you. But it\r\ndoes not please me to think that I shall be away at your marriage.\r\nPray make your father understand that it was absolutely unavoidable.\r\nBut I shall see him, of course, when I come back. And I shall see you\r\ntoo before very long."\r\n\r\n"Shall you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"And why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because Mr. Grey must be at Silverbridge for his election.--But\r\nperhaps I ought not tell you his secrets." Then he took her into the\r\nbreakfast-parlour and showed her his present. It was a service of\r\nSevres china,--very precious and beautiful. "I got you these things\r\nbecause Grey likes china."\r\n\r\n"So do I like china," said she, with her face brighter than he had\r\never yet seen it.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would like them best," said he. Alice looking up at\r\nhim with her eyes full of tears told him that she did like them best;\r\nand then, as he wished her all happiness, and as he was stooping over\r\nher to kiss her, Lady Glencora came in.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon," said she, "I was just one minute too soon; was I\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"She would have them sent here and unpacked," said Mr. Palliser,\r\n"though I told her it was foolish."\r\n\r\n"Of course I would," said Lady Glencora. "Everything shall be\r\nunpacked and shown. It\'s easy to get somebody to pack them again."\r\n\r\nMuch of the wedding tribute had already been deposited with the\r\nchina, and among other things there were the jewels that Lady\r\nMidlothian had brought.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, her ladyship\'s diamonds are not to be sneezed at,"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for diamonds," said Alice.\r\n\r\nThen Lady Glencora took up the Countess\'s trinkets, and shook her\r\nhead and turned up her nose. There was a wonderfully comic expression\r\non her face as she did so.\r\n\r\n"To me they are just as good as the others," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"To me they are not, then," said Lady Glencora. "Diamonds are\r\ndiamonds, and garnets are garnets; and I am not so romantic but what\r\nI know the difference."\r\n\r\nOn the evening before the marriage Alice and Lady Glencora walked for\r\nthe last time through the Priory ruins. It was now September, and the\r\nevenings were still long, so that the ladies could get out upon the\r\nlawn after dinner. Whether Lady Glencora would have been allowed to\r\nwalk through the ruins so late as half-past eight in the evening if\r\nher husband had been there may be doubtful, but her husband was away\r\nand she took this advantage of his absence.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember that night we were here?" said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"When shall I forget it; or how is it possible that such a night\r\nshould ever be forgotten?"\r\n\r\n"No; I shall never forget it. Oh dear, what wonderful things have\r\nhappened since that! Do you ever think of Jeffrey?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--of course I think of him. I did like him so much. I hope I\r\nshall see him some day."\r\n\r\n"And he liked you too, young woman; and, what was more, young woman,\r\nI thought at one time that, perhaps, you were going to like him in\r\nearnest."\r\n\r\n"Not in that way, certainly."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done much better, of course; especially as poor Jeffrey\'s\r\nchance of promotion doesn\'t look so good now. If I have a boy, I\r\nwonder whether he\'ll hate me?"\r\n\r\n"Why should he hate you?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it, you know, if he does. Only think what it is to\r\nPlantagenet. Have you seen the difference it makes in him already?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it makes a difference;--the greatest difference in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"And think what it will be to me, Alice. I used to lie in bed and\r\nwish myself dead, and make up my mind to drown myself,--if I could\r\nonly dare. I shan\'t think any more of that poor fellow now." Then she\r\ntold Alice what had been done for Burgo; how his uncle had paid his\r\nbills once again, and had agreed to give him a small income. "Poor\r\nfellow!" said Lady Glencora, "it won\'t do more than buy him gloves,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\nThe marriage was magnificent, greatly to the dismay of Alice and\r\nto the discomfort of Mr. Vavasor, who came down on the eve of the\r\nceremony,--arriving while his daughter and Lady Glencora were in\r\nthe ruins. Mr. Grey seemed to take it all very easily, and, as Lady\r\nGlencora said, played his part exactly as though he were in the habit\r\nof being married, at any rate, once a year. "Nothing on earth will\r\never put him out, so you need not try, my dear," she said, as Alice\r\nstood with her a moment alone in the dressing-room up-stairs before\r\nher departure.\r\n\r\n"I know that," said Alice, "and therefore I shall never try."\r\n\r\n\r\nxxxxxxxxxx\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nThe Story Is Finished Within the Halls of the Duke of Omnium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Grey and wife were duly carried away from Matching Priory by post\r\nhorses, and did their honeymoon, we may be quite sure, with much\r\nsatisfaction. When Alice was first asked where she would go, she\r\nsimply suggested that it should not be to Switzerland. They did, in\r\ntruth, go by slow stages to Italy, to Venice, Florence, and on to\r\nRome; but such had not been their intention when they first started\r\non their journey. At that time Mr. Grey believed that he would be\r\nwanted again in England, down at Silverbridge in Barsetshire, very\r\nshortly. But before he had married a week he learned that all that\r\nwas to be postponed. The cup of fruition had not yet reached Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s lips. "There will be no vacancy either in the county or in\r\nthe borough till Parliament meets." That had been the message sent\r\nby Mr. Palliser to Mr. Grey. Lady Glencora\'s message to Alice had been\r\nrather more full, having occupied three pages of note paper, the\r\nlast of which had been crossed, but I do not know that it was more\r\nexplicit. She had abused Lord Brock, had abused Mr. Finespun, and had\r\nabused all public things and institutions, because the arrangements\r\nas now proposed would be very comfortable to Alice, but would not,\r\nas she was pleased to think, be very comfortable to herself. "You\r\ncan go to Rome and see everything and enjoy yourself, which I was\r\nnot allowed to do; and all this noise and bother, and crowd of\r\nelectioneering, will take place down in Barsetshire just when I am in\r\nthe middle of all my trouble." There were many very long letters came\r\nfrom Lady Glencora to Rome during the winter,--letters which Alice\r\nenjoyed thoroughly, but which she could not but regard as being very\r\nindiscreet. The Duke was at the Castle during the Christmas week, and\r\nthe descriptions of the Duke and of his solicitude as to his heir\r\nwere very comic. "He comes and bends over me on the sofa in the most\r\nstupendous way, as though a woman to be the mother of his heir must\r\nbe a miracle in nature. He is quite awful when he says a word or two,\r\nand more awful in his silence. The devil prompted me the other day,\r\nand I said I hoped it would be a girl. There was a look came over his\r\nface which nearly frightened me. If it should be, I believe he will\r\nturn me out of the house; but how can I help it? I wish you were\r\ngoing to have a baby at the same time. Then, if yours was a boy and\r\nmine a girl, we\'d make a change." This was very indiscreet. Lady\r\nGlencora would write indiscreet letters like this, which Alice could\r\nnot show to her husband. It was a thousand pities.\r\n\r\nBut December and January wore themselves away, and the time came in\r\nwhich the Greys were bound to return to England. The husband had\r\nvery fully discussed with his wife that matter of his parliamentary\r\nambition, and found in her a very ready listener. Having made up\r\nhis mind to do this thing, he was resolved to do it thoroughly, and\r\nwas becoming almost as full of politics, almost as much devoted to\r\nsugar, as Mr. Palliser himself. He at any rate could not complain that\r\nhis wife would not interest herself in his pursuits. Then, as they\r\nreturned, came letters from Lady Glencora, written as her troubles\r\ngrew nigh. The Duke had gone, of course; but he was to be there at\r\nthe appointed time. "Oh, I do so wish he would have a fit of the gout\r\nin London,--or at Timbuctoo," said Lady Glencora. When they reached\r\nLondon they first heard the news from Mr. Vavasor, who on this\r\noccasion condescended to meet them at the railway. "The Duke has got\r\nan heir," he said, before the carriage-door was open;--"born this\r\nmorning!" One might have supposed that it was the Duke\'s baby, and\r\nnot the baby of Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser. There was a note from\r\nMr. Palliser to Mr. Grey. "Thank God!" said the note, "Lady Glencora\r\nand the boy"--Mr. Palliser had scorned to use the word child--"Lady\r\nGlencora and the boy are quite as well as can be expected. Both the\r\nnew writs were moved for last night." Mr. Palliser\'s honours, as will\r\nbe seen, came rushing upon him all at once.\r\n\r\nWondrous little baby,--_purpureo genitus!_ What have the gods not\r\ndone for thee, if thou canst only manage to live till thy good things\r\nare all thine own,--to live through all the terrible solicitude with\r\nwhich they will envelope thee! Better than royal rank will be thine,\r\nwith influence more than royal, and power of action fettered by no\r\nroyalty. Royal wealth which will be really thine own, to do with it\r\nas it beseemeth thee. Thou wilt be at the top of an aristocracy in a\r\ncountry where aristocrats need gird themselves with no buckram. All\r\nthat the world can give will be thine; and yet when we talk of thee\r\nreligiously, philosophically, or politico-economically, we are wont\r\nto declare that thy chances of happiness are no better,--no better,\r\nif they be no worse,--than are those of thine infant neighbour just\r\nborn, in that farmyard cradle. Who shall say that they are better or\r\nthat they are worse? Or if they be better, or if they be worse, how\r\nshall we reconcile to ourselves that seeming injustice?\r\n\r\nAnd now we will pay a little visit to the small one born in the\r\npurple, and the story of that visit shall be the end of our history.\r\nIt was early in April, quite early in April, and Mr. and Mrs. Grey were\r\nboth at Gatherum Castle. Mrs. Grey was there at the moment of which\r\nwe write, but Mr. Grey was absent at Silverbridge with Mr. Palliser.\r\nThis was the day of the Silverbridge election, and Mr. Grey had gone\r\nto that ancient borough, to offer himself as a candidate to the\r\nelectors, backed by the presence and aid of a very powerful member of\r\nthe Cabinet. Lady Glencora and Alice were sitting up-stairs with the\r\nsmall, purple-born one in their presence, and the small, purple-born\r\none was lying in Alice\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"It is such a comfort that it is over," said the mother.\r\n\r\n"You are the most ungrateful of women."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Alice,--if you could have known! Your baby may come just as it\r\npleases. You won\'t lie awake trembling how on earth you will bear\r\nyour disgrace if one of the vile weaker sex should come to disturb\r\nthe hopes of your lords and masters;--for I had two, which made it so\r\nmuch more terrible."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Mr. Palliser would not have said a word."\r\n\r\n"No, he would have said nothing,--nor would the Duke. The Duke would\r\nsimply have gone away instantly, and never have seen me again till\r\nthe next chance comes,--if it ever does come. And Mr. Palliser would\r\nhave been as gentle as a dove;--much more gentle than he is now, for\r\nmen are rarely gentle in their triumph. But I should have known what\r\nthey both thought and felt."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right now, dear."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my bonny boy,--you have made it all right for me;--have you\r\nnot?" And Lady Glencora took her baby into her own arms. "You have\r\nmade everything right, my little man. But oh, Alice, if you had seen\r\nthe Duke\'s long face through those three days; if you had heard the\r\ntones of the people\'s voices as they whispered about me; if you\r\nhad encountered the oppressive cheerfulness of those two London\r\ndoctors,--doctors are such bad actors,--you would have thought it\r\nimpossible for any woman to live throughout. There\'s one comfort;--if\r\nmy mannikin lives, I can\'t have another eldest. He looks like\r\nliving;--don\'t he, Alice?" Then were perpetrated various mysterious\r\nceremonies of feminine idolatry which were continued till there came\r\na grandly dressed old lady, who called herself the nurse, and who\r\ntook the idol away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Yes, my bonny boy,--you have made it\r\nall right for me."]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of that afternoon Lady Glencora took Alice all over\r\nthe house. It was a castle of enormous size, quite new,--having been\r\nbuilt by the present proprietor,--very cold, very handsome, and very\r\ndull. "What an immense place!" said Alice, as she stood looking round\r\nher in the grand hall, which was never used as an entrance except on\r\nvery grand occasions. "Is it not? And it cost--oh, I can\'t tell you\r\nhow much it cost. A hundred thousand pounds or more. Well;--that\r\nwould be nothing, as the Duke no doubt had the money in his pocket\r\nto do what he liked with at the time. But the joke is, nobody ever\r\nthinks of living here. Who\'d live in such a great, overgrown place\r\nsuch as this, if they could get a comfortable house like Matching? Do\r\nyou remember Longroyston and the hot-water pipes? I always think of\r\nthe poor Duchess when I come through here. Nobody ever lives here, or\r\never will. The Duke comes for one week in the year, and Plantagenet\r\nsays he hates to do that. As for me, nothing on earth shall ever make\r\nme live here. I was completely in their power and couldn\'t help their\r\nbringing me here the other day;--because I had, as it were, disgraced\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"How disgraced yourself?"\r\n\r\n"In being so long, you know, before that gentleman was born. But they\r\nshan\'t play me the same trick again. I shall dare to assert myself,\r\nnow. Come,--we must go away. There are some of the British public\r\ncome to see one of the British sights. That\'s another pleasure here.\r\nOne has to run about to avoid being caught by the visitors. The\r\nhousekeeper tells me they always grumble because they are not allowed\r\nto go into my little room up-stairs."\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey returned home from\r\nSilverbridge together. The latter was then a Member of Parliament,\r\nbut the former at that moment was the possessor of no such dignity.\r\nThe election for the borough was now over, whereas that for the\r\ncounty had not yet taken place. But there was no rival candidate for\r\nthe position, and Mr. Palliser was thoroughly contented with his fate.\r\nHe was at this moment actually Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in\r\nabout ten days\' time would be on his legs in the House proposing for\r\nhis country\'s use his scheme of finance. The two men were seated\r\ntogether in an open carriage, and were being whirled along by four\r\nhorses. They were both no doubt happy in their ambition, but I think\r\nthat of the two, Mr. Palliser showed his triumph the most. Not that he\r\nspoke even to his friend a word that was triumphant in its tone. It\r\nwas not thus that he rejoiced. He was by nature too placid for that.\r\nBut there was a nervousness in his contentment which told the tale to\r\nany observer who might know how to read it.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll like it," he said to Grey.\r\n\r\n"I shall never like it as you do," Grey answered.\r\n\r\n"And why not;--why not?"\r\n\r\n"In the first place, I have not begun it so young."\r\n\r\n"Any time before thirty-five is young enough."\r\n\r\n"For useful work, yes,--but hardly for enjoyment in the thing. And\r\nthen I don\'t believe it all as you do. To you the British House of\r\nCommons is everything."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--everything," said Mr. Palliser with unwonted\r\nenthusiasm;--"everything, everything. That and the Constitution are\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"It is not so to me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but it will be. If you really take to the work, and put yourself\r\ninto harness, it will be so. You\'ll get to feel it as I do. The man\r\nwho is counted by his colleagues as number one on the Treasury Bench\r\nin the English House of Commons, is the first of living men. That\'s\r\nmy opinion. I don\'t know that I ever said it before; but that\'s my\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\n"And who is the second;--the purse-bearer to this great man?"\r\n\r\n"I say nothing about the second. I don\'t know that there is any\r\nsecond. I wonder how we shall find Lady Glencora and the boy." They\r\nhad then arrived at the side entrance to the Castle, and Mr. Grey ran\r\nup-stairs to his wife\'s room to receive her congratulations.\r\n\r\n"And you are a Member of Parliament?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"They tell me so, but I don\'t know whether I actually am one till\r\nI\'ve taken the oaths."\r\n\r\n"I am so happy. There\'s no position in the world so glorious!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you are not Mr. Palliser\'s wife. That\'s just what he has\r\nbeen saying."\r\n\r\n"Oh, John, I am so happy. It is so much more than I have deserved. I\r\nhope,--that is, I sometimes think--"\r\n\r\n"Think what, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing that I have ever said has driven you to it."\r\n\r\n"I\'d do more than that, dear, to make you happy," he said, as he put\r\nhis arm round her and kissed her; "more than that, at least if it\r\nwere in my power."\r\n\r\nProbably my readers may agree with Alice, that in the final\r\nadjustment of her affairs she had received more than she had\r\ndeserved. All her friends, except her husband, thought so. But as\r\nthey have all forgiven her, including even Lady Midlothian herself, I\r\nhope that they who have followed her story to its close will not be\r\nless generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAN YOU FORGIVE HER?***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 19500.txt or 19500.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/5/0/19500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
