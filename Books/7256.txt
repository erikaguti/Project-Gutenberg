Henry\r\n\r\n\r\nOne dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it\r\nwas in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the\r\ngrocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks burned\r\nwith the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing\r\nimplied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven\r\ncents. And the next day would be Christmas.\r\n\r\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little\r\ncouch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection\r\nthat life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles\r\npredominating.\r\n\r\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first\r\nstage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8\r\nper week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had\r\nthat word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go,\r\nand an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.\r\nAlso appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \xe2\x80\x9cMr. James\r\nDillingham Young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDillingham\xe2\x80\x9d had been flung to the breeze during a former period of\r\nprosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when\r\nthe income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of\r\ncontracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James\r\nDillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x9d and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already\r\nintroduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\r\n\r\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.\r\nShe stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a\r\ngray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she\r\nhad only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving\r\nevery penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a\r\nweek doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.\r\nThey always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a\r\nhappy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something\r\nfine and rare and sterling\xe2\x80\x94something just a little bit near to being\r\nworthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\r\n\r\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you\r\nhave seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person\r\nmay, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal\r\nstrips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being\r\nslender, had mastered the art.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her\r\neyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within\r\ntwenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its\r\nfull length.\r\n\r\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which\r\nthey both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\xe2\x80\x99s gold watch that had been\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s and his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s. The other was Della\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Had the\r\nqueen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have\r\nlet her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all\r\nhis treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his\r\nwatch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from\r\nenvy.\r\n\r\nSo now Della\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like\r\na cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself\r\nalmost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and\r\nquickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or\r\ntwo splashed on the worn red carpet.\r\n\r\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl\r\nof skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she\r\nfluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\r\n\r\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \xe2\x80\x9cMme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All\r\nKinds.\xe2\x80\x9d One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting.\r\nMadame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \xe2\x80\x9cSofronie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you buy my hair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Della.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI buy hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame. \xe2\x80\x9cTake yer hat off and let\xe2\x80\x99s have a sight at\r\nthe looks of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me quick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Della.\r\n\r\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed\r\nmetaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\xe2\x80\x99s present.\r\n\r\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.\r\nThere was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all\r\nof them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in\r\ndesign, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by\r\nmeretricious ornamentation\xe2\x80\x94as all good things should do. It was even\r\nworthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s. It was like him. Quietness and value\xe2\x80\x94the description applied to\r\nboth. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried\r\nhome with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be\r\nproperly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was,\r\nhe sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather\r\nstrap that he used in place of a chain.\r\n\r\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence\r\nand reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went\r\nto work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which\r\nis always a tremendous task, dear friends\xe2\x80\x94a mammoth task.\r\n\r\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls\r\nthat made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at\r\nher reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Jim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore he takes a\r\nsecond look at me, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl.\r\nBut what could I do\xe2\x80\x94oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven\r\ncents?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt 7 o\xe2\x80\x99clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of\r\nthe stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\r\n\r\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on\r\nthe corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she\r\nheard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she\r\nturned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little\r\nsilent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she\r\nwhispered: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease God, make him think I am still pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and\r\nvery serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two\xe2\x80\x94and to be burdened\r\nwith a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\r\n\r\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of\r\nquail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in\r\nthem that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger,\r\nnor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments\r\nthat she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with\r\nthat peculiar expression on his face.\r\n\r\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me that way. I had my hair\r\ncut off and sold because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lived through Christmas\r\nwithout giving you a present. It\xe2\x80\x99ll grow out again\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind, will\r\nyou? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \xe2\x80\x98Merry\r\nChristmas!\xe2\x80\x99 Jim, and let\xe2\x80\x99s be happy. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a nice\xe2\x80\x94what a\r\nbeautiful, nice gift I\xe2\x80\x99ve got for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not\r\narrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut it off and sold it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Della. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like me just as well,\r\nanyhow? I\xe2\x80\x99m me without my hair, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim looked about the room curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say your hair is gone?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t look for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Della. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sold, I tell you\xe2\x80\x94sold and\r\ngone, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you.\r\nMaybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with sudden\r\nserious sweetness, \xe2\x80\x9cbut nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall\r\nI put the chops on, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della.\r\nFor ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some\r\ninconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or\r\na million a year\xe2\x80\x94what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would\r\ngive you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that\r\nwas not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\r\n\r\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make any mistake, Dell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cabout me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that\r\ncould make me like my girl any less. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ll unwrap that package\r\nyou may see why you had me going a while at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an\r\necstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to\r\nhysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of\r\nall the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\r\n\r\nFor there lay The Combs\xe2\x80\x94the set of combs, side and back, that Della had\r\nworshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise\r\nshell, with jewelled rims\xe2\x80\x94just the shade to wear in the beautiful\r\nvanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had\r\nsimply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of\r\npossession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have\r\nadorned the coveted adornments were gone.\r\n\r\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up\r\nwith dim eyes and a smile and say: \xe2\x80\x9cMy hair grows so fast, Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him\r\neagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash\r\nwith a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nto look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I\r\nwant to see how it looks on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands\r\nunder the back of his head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s put our Christmas presents away and keep \xe2\x80\x99em a\r\nwhile. They\xe2\x80\x99re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get\r\nthe money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men\xe2\x80\x94wonderfully wise men\xe2\x80\x94who brought\r\ngifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving\r\nChristmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones,\r\npossibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And\r\nhere I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two\r\nfoolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other\r\nthe greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise\r\nof these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were\r\nthe wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.\r\nEverywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GIFT OF THE MAGI ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
