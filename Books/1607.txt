Astor\r\n******This file should be named 1607.txt or ajiow160710.zip******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was prepared with the use of Calera WordScan Plus 2.0\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,\r\nall of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a\r\ncopyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\r\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\r\n\r\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\r\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\r\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\r\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\r\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\r\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\r\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\r\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\r\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\r\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are\r\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

While a limited knowledge of both Greek\r\nand Latin is important for the correct use of our own language,\r\nthe amount till recently required, in my judgment, has been\r\nabsurdly out of proportion to the intrinsic value of these\r\nbranches, or perhaps more correctly roots, of study.  The\r\nclassics have been thoroughly and painfully threshed out, and it\r\nseems impossible that anything new can be unearthed.  We may\r\nequal the performances of the past, but there is no opportunity\r\nto surpass them or produce anything original.  Even the\r\nmuch-vaunted "mental training" argument is beginning to pall; for\r\nwould not anything equally difficult give as good developing\r\nresults, while by learning a live matter we kill two birds with\r\none stone?  There can be no question that there are many forces\r\nand influences in Nature whose existence we as yet little more\r\nthan suspect.  How much more interesting it would be if, instead\r\nof reiterating our past achievements, the magazines and\r\nliterature of the period should devote their consideration to\r\nwhat we do NOT know!  It is only through investigation and\r\nresearch that inventions come; we may not find what we are in\r\nsearch of, but may discover something of perhaps greater moment.\r\nIt is probable that the principal glories of the future will be\r\nfound in as yet but little trodden paths, and as Prof. Cortlandt\r\njustly says at the close of his history, "Next to religion, we\r\nhave most to hope from science."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BOOK  I.\r\nCHAPTER\r\n   I.-JUPITER.\r\n   II.-ANTECEDENTAL\r\n   III.-PRESIDENT BEARWARDEN\'S SPEECH\r\n   IV.-PROF.

What transports of delight, what ecstatic bliss, was\r\ntheirs!  Men had discovered and mastered the secret of apergy,\r\nand now, "little lower than the angels," they could soar through\r\nspace, leaving even planets and comets behind.\r\n\r\n"Is it not strange," said Dr. Cortlandt, "that though it has been\r\nknown for over a century that bodies charged with unlike\r\nelectricities attract one another, and those charged with like\r\nrepel, no one thought of utilizing the counterpart of\r\ngravitation?  In the nineteenth century, savants and Indian\r\njugglers performed experiments with their disciples and masses of\r\ninert matter, by causing them to remain without visible support\r\nat some distance from the ground; and while many of these, of\r\ncourse, were quacks, some were on the right track, though they\r\ndid not push their research."\r\n\r\nPresident Bearwarden and Ayrault assented.  They were steering\r\nfor an apparently hard part of the planet\'s surface, about a\r\ndegree and a half north of its equator.\r\n\r\n"Since Jupiter\'s axis is almost at right angles to  the plane of\r\nits orbit," said the doctor, "being inclined only about one\r\ndegree and a half, instead of twenty-three and a half, as was the\r\nearth\'s till nearly so recently, it will be possible for us to\r\nhave any climate we wish, from constantly warm at the equator to\r\nconstantly cool or cold as we approach the poles, without being\r\ntroubled by extremes of winter and summer."\r\n\r\nUntil the Callisto entered the planet\'s atmosphere, its five\r\nmoons appeared like silver shields against the black sky, but now\r\nthings were looking more terrestrial, and they began to feel at\r\nhome.  Bearwarden put down his note-book, and Ayrault returned a\r\nphotograph to his pocket, while all three gazed at their new\r\nabode.  Beneath them was a vast continent variegated by chains of\r\nlakes and rivers stretching away in all directions except toward\r\nthe equator, where lay a placid ocean as far as their telescopes\r\ncould pierce.  To the eastward were towering and massive\r\nmountains, and along the southern border of the continent smoking\r\nvolcanoes, while toward the west they saw forests, gently rolling\r\nplains, and table-lands that would have satisfied a poet or set\r\nan agriculturist\'s heart at rest.  "How I should like to mine\r\nthose hills for copper, or drain the swamps to the south!"\r\nexclaimed Col. Bearwarden.  "The Lake Superior mines and the\r\nreclamation of the Florida Everglades would be nothing to this."\r\n\r\n"Any inhabitants we may find here have so much land at their\r\ndisposal that they will not need to drain swamps on account of\r\npressure of population for some time," put in the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I hope we may find some four-legged inhabitants," said Ayrault,\r\nthinking of their explosive magazine rifles.  "If Jupiter is\r\npassing through its Jurassic or Mesozoic period, there must be\r\nany amount of some kind of game."  Just then a quiver shook the\r\nCallisto, and glancing to the right they noticed one of the\r\nvolcanoes in violent eruption.  Smoke filled the air in clouds,\r\nhot stones and then floods of lava poured from the crater, while\r\neven the walls of the hermetically sealed Callisto could not\r\narrest the thunderous crashes that made the interior of the car\r\nresound.\r\n\r\n"Had we not better move on?" said Bearwarden, and accordingly\r\nthey went toward the woods they had first seen.  Finding a firm\r\nstrip of land between the forest and an arm of the sea, they\r\ngently grounded the Callisto, and not being altogether sure how\r\nthe atmosphere of their new abode would suit terrestrial lungs,\r\nor what its pressure to the square inch might be, they cautiously\r\nopened a port-hole a crack, retaining their hold upon it with its\r\nscrew.  Instantly there was a rush and a whistling sound as of\r\nescaping steam, while in a few moments their barometer stood at\r\nthirty-six inches, whereupon they closed the opening.\r\n\r\n"I fancy," said Dr. Cortlandt, "we had better wait now till we\r\nbecome accustomed to this pressure.  I do not believe it will go\r\nmuch higher, for the window made but little resistance when we\r\nshut it."\r\n\r\nFinding they were not inconvenienced by a pressure but little\r\ngreater than that of a deep coal-mine, they again opened the\r\nport, whereupon their barometer showed a further rise to\r\nforty-two, and then remained stationary.  Finding also that the\r\nchemical composition of the air suited them, and that they had no\r\ndifficulty in breathing, the pressure being the same as that\r\nsustained by a diver in fourteen feet of water, they opened a\r\ndoor and emerged.  They knew fairly well what to expect, and were\r\nnot disturbed by their new conditions.  Though they had\r\napparently gained a good deal in weight as a result of their\r\nethereal journey, this did not incommode them; for though\r\nJupiter\'s volume is thirteen hundred times that of the earth, on\r\naccount of its lesser specific gravity, it has but three hundred\r\ntimes the mass--i. e., it would weigh but three hundred times as\r\nmuch.  Further, although a cubic foot of water or anything else\r\nweighs 2.5 as much as on earth, objects near the equator, on\r\naccount of Jupiter\'s rapid rotation, weigh one fifth less than\r\nthey do at the poles, by reason of the centrifugal force.\r\nInfluenced by this fact, and also because they were 483,000,000\r\nmiles from the sun, instead of 92,000,000 as on earth, they had\r\nsteered for the northern limit of Jupiter\'s tropics.  And, in\r\naddition to this, they could easily apply the apergetic power in\r\nany degree to themselves when beyond the limits of the Callisto,\r\nand so be attracted to any extent, from twice the pull they\r\nreceive from gravitation on earth to almost nothing.\r\n\r\nBearwarden and Ayrault shouldered their rifles, while Dr.\r\nCortlandt took a repeating shot-gun with No. 4 shot, and, having\r\nalso some hunting-knives and a sextant, all three set out in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction.  The ground was rather soft, and a warm\r\nvapor seemed to rise from it.  To the east the sky was veiled by\r\ndense clouds of smoke from the towering volcanoes, while on their\r\nleft the forest seemed to extend without limit.  Clumps of huge\r\nferns were scattered about, and the ground was covered with\r\ncurious tracks.\r\n\r\n"Jupiter is evidently passing through a Carboniferous or Devonian\r\nperiod such as existed on earth, though, if consistent with its\r\nsize, it should be on a vastly larger scale," said the doctor.\r\n"I never believed in the theory," he continued, "that the larger\r\nthe planet the smaller should be its inhabitants, and always\r\nconsidered it a makeshift, put forward in the absence of definite\r\nknowledge, the idea being apparently that the weight of very\r\nlarge creatures would be too great for their strength.  Of the\r\nfact that mastodons and creatures far larger than any now living\r\non earth existed there, we have absolute proof, though\r\ngravitation must have been practically the same then as now."\r\n\r\nJust here they came upon a number of huge bones, evidently the\r\nremains of some saurian, and many times the size of a grown\r\ncrocodile.  On passing a growth of most luxuriant vegetation,\r\nthey saw a half-dozen sacklike objects, and drawing nearer\r\nnoticed that the tops began to swell, and at the same time became\r\nlighter in colour.  Just as the doctor was about to investigate\r\none of them with his duck-shot, the enormously inflated tops of\r\nthe creatures collapsed with a loud report, and the entire group\r\nsoared away.  When about to alight, forty yards off, they\r\ndistended membranous folds in the manner of wings, which checked\r\ntheir descent, and on touching the ground remained where they\r\nwere without rebound.\r\n\r\n"We expected to find all kinds of reptiles and birds," exclaimed\r\nthe doctor.  "But I do not know  how we should class those\r\ncreatures.  They seem to have pneumatic feet and legs, for their\r\nmotion was certainly not produced like that of frogs."\r\n\r\nWhen the party came up with them the heads again began to swell.\r\n\r\n"I will perforate the air-chamber of one," said Col. Bearwarden,\r\nwithdrawing the explosive cartridge from the barrel of his rifle\r\nand substituting one with a solid ball.  "This will doubtless\r\ndisable one so that we can examine it."\r\n\r\nJust as they were about to rise, he shot the largest through the\r\nneck.  All but the wounded one, soared off, while Bearwarden,\r\nAyrault, and Cortlandt approached to examine it more closely.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Cortlandt, "this vertebrate--for that is as\r\ndefinitely as we can yet describe it--forces a great pressure of\r\nair into its head and neck, which, by the action of valves, it\r\nmust allow to rush into its very rudimentary lower extremities,\r\ndistending them with such violence that the body is shot upward\r\nand forward.  You may have noticed the tightly inflated portion\r\nunderneath as they left the ground."\r\n\r\nWhile speaking he had moved rather near, when suddenly a\r\npartially concealed mouth opened, showing the unmistakable tongue\r\nand fangs of a serpent.  It emitted a hissing sound, and the\r\nsmall eyes gleamed maliciously.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe it is a poisonous species?" asked Ayrault.\r\n\r\n"I suspect it is," replied the doctor; "for, though it is\r\ndoubtless able to leap with great accuracy upon its prey, we saw\r\nit took some time to recharge the upper air-chamber, so that,\r\nwere it not armed with poison glands, it would fall an easy\r\nvictim to its more powerful and swifter contemporaries, and would\r\nsoon become extinct."\r\n\r\n"As it will be unable to spring for some time," said Bearwarden,\r\n"we might as well save it the disappointment of trying," and,\r\nsnapping the used shell from his rifle, he fired an explosive\r\nball into the reptile, whereupon about half the body disappeared,\r\nwhile a sickening odour arose.  Although the sun was still far\r\nabove the horizon, the rapidity with which it was descending\r\nshowed that the short night of less than five hours would soon be\r\nupon them; and though short it might be very dark, for they were\r\nin the tropics, and the sun, going down perpendicularly, must\r\nalso pass completely around the globe, instead of, as in northern\r\nlatitudes on earth in summer, approaching the horizon obliquely,\r\nand not going far below it.  A slight and diffused sound here\r\nseemed to rise from the ground all about them, for which they\r\ncould not account.  Presently it became louder, and as the sun\r\ntouched the horizon, it poured forth in prolonged strains.  The\r\nlarge trumpet-shaped lilies, reeds, and heliotropes seemed fairly\r\nto throb as they raised their anthem to the sky and the setting\r\nsun, while the air grew dark with clouds of birds that gradually\r\nalighted on the ground, until, as the chorus grew fainter and\r\ngradually ceased, they flew back to their nests.  The three\r\ncompanions had stood astonished while this act was played.  The\r\ndoctor then spoke:\r\n\r\n"This is the most marvellous  development of Nature I have seen,\r\nfor its wonderful divergence from, and yet analogy to, what takes\r\nplace on earth.  You know our flowers offer honey, as it were, as\r\nbait to insects, that in eating or collecting it they may catch\r\nthe pollen on their legs and so carry it to other flowers,\r\nperhaps of the opposite sex.  Here flowers evidently appeal to\r\nthe sense of hearing instead of taste, and make use of birds, of\r\nwhich there are enormous numbers, instead of winged insects, of\r\nwhich I have seen none, one being perhaps the natural result of\r\nthe other.  The flowers have become singers by long practice, or\r\nelse, those that were most musical having had the best chance to\r\nreproduce, we have a neat illustration of the \'survival of the\r\nfittest.\'  The sound is doubtless produced by a shrinking of the\r\nfibres as the sun withdraws its heat, in which case we may expect\r\nanother song at sunrise, when the same result will be effected by\r\ntheir expanding."\r\n\r\nSearching for a camping-place in which to pass the coming hours,\r\nthey saw lights flitting about like will-o\'-the-wisps, but\r\nbrighter and intermittent.\r\n\r\n"They seem to be as bright as sixteen-candle-power lamps, but the\r\nlight is yellower, and appears to emanate from a comparatively\r\nlarge surface, certainly nine or ten inches square," said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nThey soon gave up the chase, however, for the lights were\r\ncontinually moving and frequently went out.  While groping in the\r\ngrowing darkness, they came upon a brown object about the size of\r\na small dog and close to the ground.  It flew off with a humming\r\ninsect sound, and as it did so it showed the brilliant\r\nphosphorescent glow they had observed.\r\n\r\n"That is a good-sized fire-fly," said Bearwarden.  "Evidently the\r\ninsects here are on the same scale as everything else.  They are\r\nlike the fire-flies in Cuba, which the Cubans are said to put\r\ninto a glass box and get light enough from to read by.  Here they\r\nwould need only one, if it could be induced to give its light\r\ncontinuously."\r\n\r\nHaving found an open space on high ground, they sat down, and\r\nBearwarden struck his repeater, which, for convenience, had been\r\narranged for Jupiter time, dividing the day into ten hours,\r\nbeginning at noon, midnight being therefore five o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Twenty minutes past four," said he, "which would correspond to\r\nabout a quarter to eleven on earth.  As the sun rises at\r\nhalf-past seven, it will be dark about three hours, for the time\r\nbetween dawn and daylight will, of course, be as short as that we\r\nhave just experienced between sunset and night."\r\n\r\n"If we stay here long," said the doctor, "I suppose we shall\r\nbecome accustomed, like sailors, to taking our four, or in this\r\ncase five, hours on duty, and five hours off."\r\n\r\n"Or," added Ayrault, "we can sleep ten consecutive hours and take\r\nthe next ten for exploring and hunting, having the sun for one\r\nhalf the time and the moons for the other."\r\n\r\nBearwarden and Cortlandt now rolled themselves in their blankets\r\nand were soon asleep, while Ayrault, whose turn it was to watch\r\ntill the moons rose--for they had not yet enough confidence in\r\ntheir new domain to sleep in darkness simultaneously--leaned his\r\nback against a rock and lighted his pipe.  In the distance he saw\r\nthe torrents of fiery lava from the volcanoes reflected in the\r\nsky, and faintly heard their thunderous crashes, while the\r\nfire-flies twinkled unconcernedly in the hollow, and the night\r\nwinds swayed the fernlike branches.  Then he gazed at the earth,\r\nwhich, but little above the horizon, shone with a faint but\r\nsteady ray, and his mind\'s eye ran beyond his natural vision\r\nwhile he pictured to himself the girl of his heart, wishing that\r\nby some communion of spirits he might convey his thoughts to her,\r\nand receive hers.  It was now the first week of January on earth.\r\nHe could almost see her house and the snow-clad trees in the\r\npark, and knew that at that hour she was dressing for dinner, and\r\nhoped and believed that he was in her heart.  While he thus\r\nmused, one moon after another rose, each at a different phase,\r\ntill three were at once in the sky.  Adjusting the electric\r\nprotection- wires that were to paralyze any creature that\r\nattempted to come within the circle, and would arouse them by\r\nringing a bell, he knocked the ashes from his pipe, rolled\r\nhimself in a blanket, and was soon asleep beside his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANTECEDENTAL.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" sounded a voice, as Dr. Cortlandt and Dick Ayrault\r\ntapped at the door of the President of the Terrestrial Axis\r\nStraightening Company\'s private office on the morning of the 21st\r\nof June, A. D. 2000.  Col. Bearwarden sat at his capacious desk,\r\nthe shadows passing over his face as April clouds flit across the\r\nsun.  He was a handsome man, and young for the important post he\r\nfilled--being scarcely forty--a graduate of West Point, with\r\ngreat executive ability, and a wonderful engineer.  "Sit down,\r\nchappies," said he; "we have still a half hour before I begin to\r\nread the report I am to make to the stockholders and\r\nrepresentatives of all the governments, which is now ready.  I\r\nknow YOU smoke," passing a box of Havanas to the professor.\r\n\r\nProf. Cortlandt, LL. D., United States Government expert,\r\nappointed to examine the company\'s calculations, was about fifty,\r\nwith a high forehead, greyish hair, and quick, grey eyes, a\r\ngeologist and astronomer, and altogether as able a man, in his\r\nown way, as Col. Bearwarden in his.  Richard Ayrault, a large\r\nstockholder and one of the honorary vice-presidents in the\r\ncompany, was about thirty, a university man, by nature a\r\nscientist, and engaged to one of the prettiest society girls, who\r\nwas then a student at Vassar, in the beautiful town of\r\nPoughkeepsie.\r\n\r\n"Knowing the way you carry things in your mind, and the\r\ndifficulty of rattling you," said Cortlandt, "we have dropped in\r\non our way to hear the speech that I would not miss for a\r\nfortune.  Let us know if we bother you."\r\n\r\n"Impossible, dear boy," replied the president genially.  "Since I\r\nsurvived your official investigations, I think I deserve some of\r\nyour attention informally."\r\n\r\n"Here are my final examinations," said Cortlandt, handing\r\nBearwarden a roll of papers.  "I have been over all your figures,\r\nand testify to their accuracy in the appendix I have added."\r\n\r\nSo they sat and chatted about the enterprise that interested\r\nCortlandt and Ayrault almost as much as Bearwarden himself.  As\r\nthe clock struck eleven, the president of the company put on his\r\nhat, and, saying au revoir to his friends, crossed the street to\r\nthe Opera House, in which he was to read a report that would be\r\ncopied in all the great journals and heard over thousands of\r\nmiles of wire in every part of the globe.  When he arrived, the\r\nvast building was already filled with a distinguished company,\r\nrepresenting the greatest intelligence, wealth, and powers of the\r\nworld.  Bearwarden went in by the stage entrance, exchanging\r\ngreetings as he did so with officers of the company and directors\r\nwho had come to hear him.  Cortlandt and Ayrault entered by the\r\nregular door, the former going to the Government representatives\'\r\nbox, the latter to join his fiancee, Sylvia Preston, who was\r\nthere with her mother.  Bearwarden had a roll of manuscript at\r\nhand, but so well did he know his speech that he scarcely glanced\r\nat it.  After being introduced by the chairman of the meeting,\r\nand seeing that his audience was all attention, he began, holding\r\nhimself erect, his clear, powerful voice making every part of the\r\nbuilding ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                 PRESIDENT BEARWARDEN\'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n"To the Bondholders and Stockholders of the Terrestrial Axis\r\nStraightening Company and Representatives of Earthly Governments.\r\n\r\n"GENTLEMEN:  You know that the objects of this company are, to\r\nstraighten the axis of the earth, to combine the extreme heat of\r\nsummer with the intense cold of winter and produce a uniform\r\ntemperature for each degree of latitude the year round.  At\r\npresent the earth\'s axis--that is, the line passing through its\r\ncentre and the two poles--is inclined to the ecliptic about\r\ntwenty-three and a half degrees.  Our summer is produced by the\r\nnorthern hemisphere\'s leaning at that angle towards the sun, and\r\nour winter by its turning that much from it.  In one case the\r\nsun\'s rays are caused to shine more perpendicularly, and in the\r\nother more obliquely.  This wabbling, like that of a top, is the\r\nsole cause of the seasons; since, owing to the eccentricity of\r\nour orbit, the earth is actually fifteen hundred thousand miles\r\nnearer the sun during our winter, in the northern hemisphere,\r\nthan in summer.  That there is no limit to a planet\'s\r\ninclination, and that inclination is not essential, we have\r\nastronomical proof.  Venus\'s axis is inclined to the plane of her\r\norbit seventy-five degrees, so that the arctic circle comes\r\nwithin fifteen degrees of the equator, and the tropics also\r\nextend to latitude seventy-five degrees, or within fifteen\r\ndegrees of the poles, producing great extremes of heat and cold.\r\n\r\n"Venus is made still more difficult of habitation by the fact\r\nthat she rotates on her axis in the same time that she revolves\r\nabout the sun, in the same way that the moon does about the\r\nearth, so that one side must be perpetually frozen while the\r\nother is parched.\r\n\r\n"In Uranus we see the axis tilted still further, so that the\r\narctic circle descends to the equator.  The most varied climate\r\nmust therefore prevail during its year, whose length exceeds\r\neighty-one of ours.\r\n\r\nThe axis of Mars is inclined about twenty-eight and two thirds\r\ndegrees to the plane of its orbit; consequently its seasons must\r\nbe very similar to ours, the extremes of heat and cold being\r\nsomewhat greater.\r\n\r\n"In Jupiter we have an illustration of a planet whose axis is\r\nalmost at right angles to the plane of its orbit, being inclined\r\nbut about a degree and a half.  The hypothetical inhabitants of\r\nthis majestic planet must therefore have perpetual summer at the\r\nequator, eternal winter at the poles, and in the temperate\r\nregions everlasting spring.  On account of the straightness of\r\nthe axis, however, even the polar inhabitants--if there are\r\nany--are not oppressed by a six months\' night, for all except\r\nthose at the VERY pole have a sunrise and a sunset every ten\r\nhours--the exact day being nine hours, fifty five minutes, and\r\ntwenty-eight seconds.  The warmth of the tropics is also tempered\r\nby the high winds that must result from the rapid whirl on its\r\naxis, every object at the equator being carried around by this at\r\nthe rate of 27,600 miles an hour, or over three thousand miles\r\nfarther than the earth\'s equator moves in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n"The inclination of the axis of our own planet has also\r\nfrequently considerably exceeded that of Mars, and again has been\r\nbut little greater than Jupiter\'s at least, this is by all odds\r\nthe most reasonable explanation of the numerous Glacial periods\r\nthrough which our globe has passed, and of the recurring mild\r\nspells, probably lasting thousands of years, in which elephants,\r\nmastodons, and other semi-tropical vertebrates roamed in Siberia,\r\nsome of which died so recently that their flesh, preserved by the\r\ncold, has been devoured by the dogs of modern explorers.\r\n\r\n"It is not to be supposed that the inclining of the axes of\r\nJupiter, Venus, the Earth, and the other planets, is now fixed;\r\nin some cases it is known to be changing.  As long ago as 1890,\r\nMajor-Gen. A. W. Drayson, of the British Army, showed, in a work\r\nentitled Untrodden Ground in Astronomy and Geology, that, as a\r\nresult of the second rotation of the earth, the inclination of\r\nits axis was changing, it having been 23@ 28\' 23" on January 1,\r\n1750, 23@ 27\' 55.3" on January 1, 1800, and 23@ 27\' 30.9" on\r\nJanuary 1, 1850; and by calculation one hundred and ten years ago\r\nshowed that in 1900 (one hundred years ago) it would be 23@ 27\'\r\n08.8".  This natural straightening is, of course, going on, and\r\nwe are merely about to anticipate it.  When this improvement was\r\nmooted, all agreed that the EXTREMES of heat and cold could well\r\nbe spared.  \'Balance those of summer against those of winter by\r\npartially straightening the axis; reduce the inclination from\r\ntwenty-three degrees, thirty minutes, to about fifteen degrees,\r\nbut let us stop there,\' many said.  Before we had gone far,\r\nhowever, we found it would be best to make the work complete.\r\nThis will reclaim and make productive the vast areas of Siberia\r\nand the northern part of this continent, and will do much for the\r\nantarctic regions; but there will still be change in temperature;\r\na wind blowing towards the equator will always be colder than one\r\nblowing from it, while the slight eccentricity of the orbit will\r\nsupply enough change to awaken recollections of seasons in our\r\neternal spring.\r\n\r\n"The way to accomplish this is to increase the weight of the pole\r\nleaving the sun, by increasing the amount of material there for\r\nthe sun to attract, and to lighten the pole approaching or\r\nturning towards the sun, by removing some heavy substance from\r\nit, and putting it preferably at the opposite pole.  This\r\nshifting of ballast is most easily accomplished, as you will\r\nreadily perceive, by confining and removing water, which is\r\neasily moved and has a considerable weight.  How we purpose to\r\napply these aqueous brakes to check the wabbling of the earth, by\r\nmeans of the attraction of the sun, you will now see.\r\n\r\n"From Commander Fillmore, of the Arctic Shade and the Committee\r\non Bulkheads and Dams, I have just received the following by\r\ncable telephone: \'The Arctic Ocean is now in condition to be\r\npumped out in summer and to have its average depth increased one\r\nhundred feet by the dams in winter.  We have already fifty\r\nmillion square yards of windmill turbine surface in position and\r\nready to move.  The cables bringing us currents from the dynamos\r\nat Niagara Falls are connected with our motors, and those from\r\nthe tidal dynamos at the Bay of Fundy will be in contact when\r\nthis reaches you, at which moment the pumps will begin.  In\r\nseveral of the landlocked gulfs and bays our system of confining\r\nis so complete, that the surface of the water can be raised two\r\nhundred feet above sea- level.  The polar bears will soon have to\r\nuse artificial ice.  Perhaps the cheers now ringing without may\r\nreach you over the telephone.\'"\r\n\r\nThe audience became greatly interested, and when the end of the\r\ntelephone was applied to a microphone the room fairly rang with\r\nexultant cheers, and those looking through a kintograph (visual\r\ntelegraph) terminating in a camera obscura on the shores of\r\nBaffin Bay were able to see engineers and workmen waving and\r\nthrowing up their caps and falling into one another\'s arms in\r\necstasies of delight.  When the excitement subsided, the\r\npresident continued:\r\n\r\n"Chairman Wetmore, of the Committee on Excavations and\r\nEmbankments in Wilkesland and the Antarctic Continent, reports:\r\n\'Two hundred and fifty thousand square miles are now hollowed out\r\nand enclosed sufficiently to hold water to an average depth of\r\nfour hundred feet.  Every summer, when the basin is allowed to\r\ndrain, we can, if necessary, extend our reservoir, and shall have\r\nthe best season of the year for doing work until the earth has\r\npermanent spring.  Though we have comparatively little water or\r\ntidal power, the earth\'s crust is so thin at this latitude, on\r\naccount of the flattening, that by sinking our tubular boilers\r\nand pipes to a depth of a few thousand feet we have secured so\r\nterrific a volume of superheated steam that, in connection with\r\nour wind turbines, we shall have no difficulty in raising half a\r\ncubic mile of water a minute to our enclosure, which is but\r\nlittle above sea-level, and into which, till the pressure\r\nincreases, we can fan or blow the water, so that it can be full\r\nthree weeks after our longest day, or, since the present\r\nunimproved arrangement gives the indigenes but one day and night\r\na year, I will add the 21st day of December.\r\n\r\n"\'We shall be able to find use for much of the potential energy\r\nof the water in the reservoir when we allow it to escape in June,\r\nin melting some of the accumulated polar ice-cap, thereby\r\ndecreasing still further the weight of this pole, in lighting and\r\nwarming ourselves until we get the sun\'s light and heat, in\r\nextending the excavations, and in charging the storage batteries\r\nof the ships at this end of the line.  Everything will be ready\r\nwhen you signal "Raise water."\'"\r\n\r\n"Let me add parenthetically," said Bearwarden, "that this means\r\nof obtaining power by steam boilers sunk to a great depth is much\r\nto be commended; for, though the amount of heat we can withdraw\r\nis too small to have much effect, the farther towards the centre\r\nour globe can be cooled the deeper will the water of the oceans\r\nbe able to penetrate--since it is its conversion into steam that\r\nprevents the water from working its way in farther--and the more\r\ndry land we shall have."\r\n\r\n"You see," the president continued, "the storage capacity at the\r\nsouth pole is not quite as great as at the north, because it is\r\nmore difficult to excavate a basin than to close the exits of one\r\nthat already exists, which is what we have done in the arctic.\r\nThe work is also not so nearly complete, since it will not be\r\nnecessary to use the southern reservoir for storing weight for\r\nsix months, or until the south pole, which is now at its maximum\r\ndeclination from the sun, is turned towards it and begins to move\r\naway; then, by increasing the amount of matter there, and at the\r\nsame time lightening the north pole, and reversing the process\r\nevery six months, we decrease the speed at which the departing\r\npole leaves the sun and at which the approaching pole advances.\r\nThe north pole, we see, will be a somewhat more powerful lever\r\nthan the south for working the globe to a straight position, but\r\nwe may be sure that the latter, in connection with the former,\r\nwill be able to hold up its end."\r\n\r\n[The building here fairly shook with applause, so that, had the\r\narctic workers used the microphone, they might have heard in the\r\nenthusiastic uproar a good counterpart of their own period.]\r\n\r\n"I only regret," the president continued, "that when we began\r\nthis work the most marvellous force yet discovered--apergy--was\r\nnot sufficiently understood to be utilized, for it would have\r\neased our labours to the point of almost eliminating them.  But\r\nwe have this consolation: it was in connection with our work that\r\nits applicability was discovered, so that had we and all others\r\npostponed our great undertaking on the pretext of waiting for a\r\nnew force, apergy might have continued to lie dormant for\r\ncenturies.  With this force, obtained by simply blending negative\r\nand positive electricity with electricity of the third element or\r\nstate, and charging a body sufficiently with this fluid,\r\ngravitation is nullified or partly reversed, and the earth repels\r\nthe body with the same or greater power than that with which it\r\nstill attracts or attracted it, so that it may be suspended or\r\ncaused to move away into space.  Sic itur ad astra, we may say.\r\nWith this force and everlasting spring before us, what may we not\r\nachieve?  We may some day be able to visit the planets, though\r\nmany may say that, since the axes of most of those we have\r\nconsidered are more inclined than ours, they would rather stay\r\nhere.  \'Blessed are they that shall inherit the earth,\'" he went\r\non, turning a four-foot globe with its axis set vertically and at\r\nright angles to a yellow globe labelled "Sun"; and again waxing\r\neloquent, he added:  "We are the instruments destined to bring\r\nabout the accomplishment of that prophecy, for never in the\r\nhistory of the world has man reared so splendid a monument to his\r\nown genius as he will in straightening the axis of the planet.\r\n\r\n"No one need henceforth be troubled by sudden change, and every\r\nman can have perpetually the climate he desires.  Northern Europe\r\nwill again luxuriate in a climate that favoured the elephants\r\nthat roamed in northern Asia and Switzerland.  To produce these\r\nanimals and the food they need, it is not necessary to have great\r\nheat, but merely to prevent great cold, half the summer\'s sun\r\nbeing absorbed in melting the winter\'s accumulation of ice.\r\n\r\n"When the axis has reached a point at which it inclines but about\r\ntwelve degrees, it will become necessary to fill the antarctic\r\nreservoir in June and the Arctic Ocean in December, in order to\r\ncheck the straightening, since otherwise it might get beyond the\r\nperpendicular and swing the other way.  When this motion is\r\ncompletely arrested, I suggest that we blow up the Aleutian Isles\r\nand enlarge Bering Strait, so as to allow what corresponds to the\r\nAtlantic Gulf Stream in the Pacific to enter the Arctic\r\nArchipelago, which I have calculated will raise the average\r\ntemperature of that entire region about thirty degrees, thereby\r\nstill further increasing the amount of available land.\r\n\r\n"Ocean currents, being the result of the prevailing winds, which\r\nwill be more regular than at present, can be counted upon to\r\ncontinue practically as they are.  It may not be plain to you why\r\nthe trade winds do not blow towards the equator due south and\r\nnorth, since the equator has much the same effect on air that a\r\nstove has in the centre of a room, causing an ascending current\r\ntowards the ceiling, which moves off in straight lines in all\r\ndirections on reaching it, its place being taken by cold currents\r\nmoving in opposite directions along the floor.  Picture to\r\nyourselves the ascending currents at the equator moving off to\r\nthe poles from which they came.  As they move north they are\r\ncontinually coming to parts of the globe having smaller circles\r\nof latitude than those they have left, and therefore not moved\r\nforward as rapidly by the earth\'s daily rotation as the latitudes\r\nnearer the equator.  The winds consequently run ahead of the\r\nsurface, and so move east of north--the earth turning towards the\r\neast--while the heavier colder surface currents, rushing towards\r\nthe equator to take the place of the ascending column, coming\r\nfrom regions where the surface whirls comparatively slowly to\r\nthose where it is rotating faster, are continually left behind,\r\nand so move southwest; while south of the equator a corresponding\r\nmotion results.  Though this is not the most exact explanation,\r\nit may serve to make the action clear.  I will add, that if any\r\none prefers a colder or a warmer climate than that of the place\r\nin which he lives, he need only go north or south for an hour;\r\nor, if he prefers his own latitude, he can rise a few thousand\r\nfeet in the air, or descend to one of the worked-out coal-mines\r\nwhich are now used as sanitariums, and secure his object by a\r\nslight change of altitude.  Let us speed the departure of racking\r\nchanges and extremes of climate, and prepare to welcome what we\r\nbelieve prevails in paradise--namely, everlasting spring."\r\n\r\nAppended to the address was the report of the Government\r\nExamining Committee, which ran:  "We have critically examined the\r\nTerrestrial Axis Straightening Company\'s figures and\r\ncalculations, also its statements involving natural philosophy,\r\nphysics, and astronomy, all of which we find correct, and hereby\r\napprove.\r\n\r\n[Signed]        "For the Committee:\r\n\r\n               "HENRY CHELMSFORD CORTLANDT,\r\n\r\n                           "Chairman."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors having ratified the acts of its officers,\r\nand passed congratulatory resolutions, the meeting adjourned sine\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n   PROF. CORTLANDT\'S HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n               IN A. D. 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Cortlandt, preparing a history of the times at the\r\nbeginning of the great terrestrial and astronomical change, wrote\r\nas follows:  "This period--A.D. 2000--is by far the most\r\nwonderful the world has as yet seen.  The advance in scientific\r\nknowledge and attainment within the memory, of the present\r\ngeneration has been so stupendous that it completely overshadows\r\nall that has preceded.  All times in history and all periods of\r\nthe world have been remarkable for some distinctive or\r\ncharacteristic trait.  The feature of the period of Louis XIV was\r\nthe splendour of the court and the centralization of power in\r\nParis.  The year 1789 marked the decline of the power of courts\r\nand the evolution of government by the people.  So, by the spread\r\nof republican ideas and the great advance in science, education\r\nhas become universal, for women as well as for men, and this is\r\nmore than ever a mechanical age.\r\n\r\n"With increased knowledge we are constantly coming to realize how\r\nlittle we really know, and are also continually finding\r\nmanifestations of forces that at first seem like exceptions to\r\nestablished laws.  This is, of course, brought about by the\r\nmodifying influence of some other natural law, though many of\r\nthese we have not yet discovered.\r\n\r\n"Electricity in its varied forms does all work, having superseded\r\nanimal and manual labour in everything, and man has only to\r\ndirect.  The greatest ingenuity next to finding new uses for this\r\nalmost omnipotent fluid has been displayed in inducing the forces\r\nof Nature, and even the sun, to produce it.  Before describing\r\nthe features of this perfection of civilization, let us review\r\nthe steps by which society and the political world reached their\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\n"At the close of the Franco-Prussian War, in 1871, Continental\r\nEurope entered upon the condition of an armed camp, which lasted\r\nfor nearly half a century.  The primary cause of this was the\r\nmutual dislike and jealousy of France and Germany, each of which\r\nstrove to have a larger and better equipped national defence than\r\nthe other.  There were also many other causes, as the ambition of\r\nthe Russian Czar, supported by his country\'s vast though\r\nimperfectly developed resources and practically unlimited supply\r\nof men, one phase of which was the constant ferment in the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, and another Russia\'s schemes for extension in Asia;\r\nanother was the general desire for colonies in Africa, in which\r\none Continental power pretty effectually blocked another, and the\r\nlatent distrust inside the Triple Alliance.  England, meanwhile,\r\npreserved a wise and profitable neutrality.\r\n\r\n"These tremendous sacrifices for armaments, both on land and\r\nwater, had far-reaching results, and, as we see it now, were\r\nclouds with silver linings.  The demand for hardened steel\r\nprojectiles, nickel-steel plates, and light and almost\r\nunbreakable machinery, was a great incentive to improvement in\r\nmetallurgy while the necessity for compact and safely carried\r\nammunition greatly stimulated chemical research, and led to the\r\ndiscovery of explosives whose powers no obstacle can resist, and\r\nincidentally to other more useful things.\r\n\r\n"Further mechanical and scientific progress, however, such as\r\nflying machines provided with these high explosives, and\r\nasphyxiating bombs containing compressed gas that could be fired\r\nfrom guns or dropped from the air, intervened.  The former would\r\nhave laid every city in the dust, and the latter might have\r\nalmost exterminated the race.  These discoveries providentially\r\nprevented hostilities, so that the \'Great War,\' so long expected,\r\nnever came, and the rival nations had their pains for nothing,\r\nor, rather, for others than themselves.\r\n\r\n"Let us now  examine the political and ethnological results.\r\nHundreds of thousands, of the flower of Continental Europe were\r\nkilled by overwork and short rations, and millions of desirable\r\nand often--unfortunately for us--undesirable people were driven\r\nto emigration, nearly all of whom came to English-speaking\r\nterritory, greatly increasing our productiveness and power.  As,\r\nwe have seen, the jealousy of the Continental powers for one\r\nanother effectually prevented their extending their influence or\r\nprotectorates to other continents, which jealousy was\r\nconsiderably aided by the small but destructive wars that did\r\ntake place.  High taxes also made it more difficult for the\r\nmoneyed men to invest in colonizing or development companies,\r\nwhich are so often the forerunners of absorption; while the\r\nUnited States, with her coal--of which the Mediterranean states\r\nhave scarcely any--other resources, and low taxes, which, though\r\nnecessary, can be nothing but an evil, has been able to expand\r\nnaturally as no other nation ever has before.\r\n\r\n"This has given the English-speakers, especially the United\r\nStates, a free hand, rendering enforcement of the Monroe doctrine\r\neasy, and started English a long way towards becoming the\r\nuniversal language, while all formerly unoccupied land is now\r\nowned by those speaking it.\r\n\r\n"At the close of our civil war, in 1865, we had but 3,000,000\r\nsquare miles, and a population of 34,000,000.  The country\r\nstaggered beneath a colossal debt of over  $4,000,000,000, had an\r\nexpensive but essentially perishable navy, and there was an\r\nominous feeling between the sections.  The purchase of Alaska in\r\n1867, by which we added over half a million square miles to our\r\nterritory, marked the resumption of the forward march of the\r\nUnited States.  Twenty-five years later, at the presidential\r\ncampaign of 1892, the debt had been reduced to $900,000,000,\r\ndeducting the sinking fund, and the charge for pensions had about\r\nreached its maximum and soon began to decrease, though no one\r\nobjected to any amount of reward for bona fide soldiers who had\r\nhelped to save the country.  The country\'s wealth had also\r\nenormously increased, while the population had grown to\r\n65,000,000.  Our ancestors had, completed or in building, a navy\r\nof which no nation need be ashamed; and, though occasionally\r\nmarred by hard times, there was general prosperity.\r\n\r\n"Gradually the different States of Canada--or provinces, as they\r\nwere then called--came to realize that their future would be far\r\ngrander and more glorious in union with the United States than\r\nseparated from it; and also that their sympathy was far stronger\r\nfor their nearest neighbours than for any one else.  One by one\r\nthese Northern States made known their desire for consolidation\r\nwith the Union, retaining complete control of their local\r\naffairs, as have the older States.  They were gladly welcomed by\r\nour Government and people, and possible rivals became the best of\r\nfriends.  Preceding and also following this, the States of\r\nMexico, Central America, and parts of South America, tiring of\r\nthe incessant revolutions and difficulties among themselves,\r\nwhich had pretty constantly looked upon us as a big brother on\r\naccount of our maintenance of the Monroe doctrine, began to\r\nagitate for annexation, knowing they would retain control of\r\ntheir local affairs.  In this they were vigorously supported by\r\nthe American residents and property-holders, who knew that their\r\npossessions would double in value the day the United States\r\nConstitution was signed.\r\n\r\n"Thus, in the first place, by the encouragement of our people,\r\nand latterly, apparently, by its own volition, the Union has\r\nincreased enormously in power, till it now embraces 10,000,000\r\nsquare miles, and has a free and enlightened population of\r\n300,000,000.  Though the Union established by Washington and his\r\ncontemporaries has attained such tremendous proportions, its\r\ngrowth is by no means finished; and as a result of modern\r\nimprovements, it is less of a journey now to go from Alaska to\r\nthe Orinoco than it was for the Father of his Country to travel\r\nfrom New York or Philadelphia to the site of the city named in\r\nhis honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Adequate and really rapid transportation facilities have done\r\nmuch to bind the different parts of the country together, and to\r\nrub off the edges of local prejudice.  Though we always favour\r\npeace, no nation would think of opposing the expressed wishes of\r\nthe United States, and our moral power for good is tremendous.\r\nThe name Japhet means enlargement, and the prophecy seems about\r\nto be literally fulfilled by these his descendants.  The bankrupt\r\nsuffering of so many European Continental powers had also other\r\nresults.  It enabled the socialists--who have never been able to\r\nsee beyond themselves--to force their governments into selling\r\ntheir colonies in the Eastern hemisphere to England, and their\r\nislands in the Western to us, in order to realize upon them.\r\nWith the addition of Canada to the United States and its loss to\r\nthe British Empire, the land possessions of the two powers became\r\nabout equal, our Union being a trifle the larger.  All danger of\r\nwar being removed by the Canadian change, a healthful and\r\nfriendly competition took its place, the nations competing in\r\ntheir growth on different hemispheres.  England easily added\r\nlarge areas in Asia and Africa, while the United States grew as\r\nwe have seen.  The race is still, in a sense, neck-and-neck, and\r\nthe English-speakers together possess nearly half the globe.  The\r\nworld\'s recent rate of progress would have been impossible\r\nwithout this approximation to a universal language.  The causes\r\nthat checkmated the Continental powers have ceased to exist.\r\nMany millions of men whose principal thought had been to destroy\r\nother members of the race became producers, but it was then too\r\nlate, for the heavy armaments had done their work.\r\n\r\n"Let us now glance at the times as they are, and see how the\r\nbusiness of life is transacted.  Manhattan Island has something\r\nover 2,500,000 inhabitants, and is surrounded by a belt of\r\npopulation, several miles wide, of 12,000,000 more, of which it\r\nis the focus, so that the entire city contains more than\r\n14,500,000 souls.  The several hundred square miles of land and\r\nwater forming greater New York are perfectly united by numerous\r\nbridges, tunnels, and electric ferries, while the city\'s great\r\nnatural advantages have been enhanced and beautified by every\r\ningenious device.  No main avenue in the newer sections is less\r\nthan two hundred feet wide, containing shade and fruit trees, a\r\nbridle-path, broad sidewalks, and open spaces for carriages and\r\nbicycles.  Several fine diagonal streets and breathing-squares\r\nhave also been provided in the older sections, and the existing\r\nparks have been supplemented by intermediate ones, all being\r\nconnected by parkways to form continuous chains.\r\n\r\n"The hollow masts of our ships--to glance at another phase en\r\npassant--carry windmills instead of sails, through which the wind\r\nperforms the work, of storing a great part of the energy required\r\nto run them at sea, while they are discharging or loading cargo\r\nin port; and it can, of course, work to better advantage while\r\nthey are stationary than when they are running before it.  These\r\nturbines are made entirely of light metal, and fold when not in\r\nuse, so that only the frames are visible.  Sometimes these also\r\nfold and are housed, or wholly disappear within the mast.\r\nSteam-boilers are also placed at the foci of huge concave\r\nmirrors, often a hundred feet in diameter, the required heat\r\nbeing supplied by the sun, without smoke, instead of by bulky and\r\ndirty coal.  This discovery gave commercial value to Sahara and\r\nother tropical deserts, which are now desirable for mill-sites\r\nand for generating power, on account of the directness with which\r\nthey receive the sun\'s rays and their freedom from clouds.  Mile\r\nafter mile Africa has been won for the uses of civilization, till\r\ngreat stretches that were considered impassible are as productive\r\nas gardens.  Our condensers, which compress, cool, and rarefy\r\nair, enabling travellers to obtain water and even ice from the\r\natmosphere, are great aids in desert exploration, removing\r\nabsolutely the principal distress of the ancient caravan.  The\r\nerstwhile \'Dark Continent\' has a larger white population now than\r\nNorth America had a hundred years ago, and has this advantage for\r\nthe future, that it contains 11,600,000 square miles, while North\r\nAmerica has less than 9,000,000.  Every part of the globe will\r\nsoon sustain about as large and prosperous a population as the\r\namount of energy it receives from the sun and other sources will\r\nwarrant; public debts and the efficiency of the governments being\r\nthe variable elements.\r\n\r\n"The rabbits in Australia, and the far more objectionable\r\npoisonous snakes in South America and India, have been\r\nexterminated by the capture of a few dozen of the creatures in\r\nthe infested districts, their inoculation with the virus similar\r\nto the murus tiphi, tuberculosis or any other contagious-germ\r\ncomplaint to which the species treated was particularly\r\nsusceptible, and the release of these individuals when the\r\ndisease was seen to be taking hold.  The rabbits and serpents\r\nreleased at once returned to their old haunts, carrying the\r\nplague far and wide.  The unfortunate rabbits were greatly\r\ncommiserated even by the medicos that wielded the death-dealing\r\nsyringe; but, fortunately for themselves, they died easily.  The\r\nreptiles, perhaps on account of the wider distribution of the\r\nnerve centres, had more lingering but not painful deaths, often,\r\nwhile in articulo mortis, leaving the holes with which they\r\nseemed to connect their discomfort, and making a final struggle\r\nalong the ground, only to die more quickly as a result of their\r\nexertions.  We have applied this also to the potato-bug, locust,\r\nand other insect pests, no victim being too small for the\r\nubiquitous, subtle germ, which, properly cultivated and utilized,\r\nhas become one of man\'s best friends.\r\n\r\n"We have microbe tests that show us as unmistakably whether the\r\ngerms of any particular disease--like malaria, typhoid, or\r\nscarlet fever--are present in the air, as litmus-paper shows\r\nalkalinity of a solution.  We also inoculate as a preventive\r\nagainst these and almost all other germ diseases, with the same\r\nsuccess that we vaccinate for smallpox.\r\n\r\n"The medicinal properties of all articles of food are so well\r\nunderstood also, that most cures are brought about simply by\r\ndieting.  This, reminds me of the mistakes perpetrated on a\r\nfriend of mine who called in Dr. Grave-Powders, one of the\r\nold-school physicians, to be treated for insomnia and dyspepsia.\r\nThis old numskull restricted his diet, gave him huge doses of\r\nmedicine, and decided most learnedly that he was daily growing\r\nworse.  Concluding that he had but a short time to live, my\r\nfriend threw away the nauseating medicines, ate whatever he had a\r\nnatural desire for, and was soon as well as ever--the obvious\r\nmoral of which is, that we can get whatever treatment we need\r\nmost beneficially from our food.  Our physicians are most serious\r\nand thoughtful men.  They never claim to be infallible, but study\r\nscientifically to increase their knowledge and improve the\r\nmethods of treatment.  As a result of this, fresh air, regular\r\nexercise for both sexes, with better conditions, and the\r\npreservation of the lives of children that formerly died by\r\nthousands from preventable causes, the physique, especially of\r\nwomen, is wonderfully improved, and the average longevity is\r\nalready over sixty.\r\n\r\n"Our social structure, to be brief, is based on science, or the\r\nconservation of energy, as the Greek philosophers predicted.  It\r\nwas known to them that a certain amount of power would produce\r\nonly a certain amount of work--that is, the weight of a clock in\r\ndescending or a spring in uncoiling returns theoretically the\r\namount of work expended in raising or coiling it, and in no\r\npossible way can it do more.  In practice, on account of\r\nfriction, etc., we know it does less.  This law, being\r\ninvariable, of course limits us, as it did Archimedes and\r\nPythagoras; we have simply utilized sources of power that their\r\nclumsy workmen allowed to escape.  Of the four principal\r\nsources--food, fuel, wind, and tide--including harnessed\r\nwaterfalls, the last two do by far the most work.  Much of the\r\nelectrical energy in every thunderstorm is also captured and\r\ncondensed in our capacious storage batteries, as natural hygeia\r\nin the form of rain was and is still caught in our country\r\ncisterns.  Every exposed place is crowned by a cluster of huge\r\nwindmills that lift water to some pond or reservoir placed as\r\nhigh as possible.  Every stiff breeze, therefore, raises millions\r\nof tons of water which  operate hydraulic turbines as required.\r\nIncidentally these storage reservoirs, by increasing the surface\r\nexposed to evaporation and the consequent rainfall, have a very\r\nbeneficial effect on the dry regions in the interior of the\r\ncontinent, and in some cases have almost superseded irrigation.\r\nThe windmill and dynamo thus utilize bleak mountain-tops that,\r\ntill their discovery, seemed to be but indifferent successes in\r\nDame Nature\'s domain.  The electricity generated by these, in\r\nconnection with that obtained by waterfalls, tidal dynamos,\r\nthunderstorms, chemical action, and slow-moving\r\nquadruple-expansion steam engines, provides the power required to\r\nrun our electric ships and water-spiders, railways, and\r\nstationary and portable motors, for heating the cables laid along\r\nthe bottom of our canals to prevent their freezing in winter, and\r\nfor almost every conceivable purpose.  Sometimes a man has a\r\nwindmill on his roof for light and heat; then, the harder the\r\nwintry blasts may blow the brighter and warmer becomes the house,\r\nthe current passing through a storage battery to make it more\r\nsteady.  The operation of our ordinary electric railways is very\r\nsimple: the current is taken from an overhead, side, or\r\nunderneath wire, directly through the air, without the\r\nintervention of a trolley, and the fast cars, for they are no\r\nlonger run in trains, make five miles a minute.  The entire\r\nweight of each car being used for its own traction, it can ascend\r\nvery steep grades, and can attain high speed or stop very\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"Another form is the magnetic railway, on which the cars are\r\nwedge-shaped at both ends, and moved by huge magnets weighing\r\nfour thousand tons each, placed fifty miles apart.  On passing a\r\nmagnet, the nature of the electricity charging a car is\r\nautomatically changed from positive to negative, or vice versa,\r\nto that of the magnet just passed, so that it repels while the\r\nnext attracts.  The successive magnets are charged oppositely,\r\nthe sections being divided halfway between by insulators, the\r\nnature of the electricity in each section being governed by the\r\ncharge in the magnet.  To prevent one kind of electricity from\r\nuniting with and neutralizing that in the next section by passing\r\nthrough the car at the moment of transit, there is a "dead\r\nstretch" of fifty yards with rails not charged at all between the\r\nsections.  This change in the nature of the electricity is\r\nrepeated automatically every fifty miles, and obviates the\r\nnecessity of revolving machinery, the rails aiding communication.\r\n\r\n"Magnetism being practically as instantaneous as gravitation, the\r\nonly limitations to speed are the electrical pressure at the\r\nmagnets, the resistance of the air, and the danger of the wheels\r\nbursting from centrifugal force.  The first can seemingly be\r\nincreased without limit; the atmospheric resistance is about to\r\nbe reduced by running the cars hermetically sealed through a\r\npartial vacuum in a steel and toughened glass tube; while the\r\nthird has been removed indefinitely by the use of galvanized\r\naluminum, which bears about the same relation to ordinary\r\naluminum that steel does to iron, and which has twice the tensile\r\nstrength and but one third the weight of steel.  In some cases\r\nthe rails are made turned in, so that it would be impossible for\r\na car to leave the track without the road-bed\'s being totally\r\ndemolished; but in most cases this is found to be unnecessary,\r\nfor no through line has a curve on its vast stretches with a\r\nradius of less than half a mile.  Rails, one hundred and sixty\r\npounds to the yard, are set in grooved steel ties, which in turn\r\nare held by a concrete road-bed consisting of broken stone and\r\ncement, making spreading rails and loose ballast impossible.  A\r\nlarge increase in capital was necessary for these improvements,\r\nthe elimination of curves being the most laborious part,\r\nrequiring bridges, cuttings, and embankments that dwarf the\r\nPyramids and would have made the ancient Pharaohs open their\r\neyes; but with the low rate of interest on bonds, the slight cost\r\nof power, and great increase in business, the venture was a\r\nsuccess, and we are now in sight of further advances that will\r\nenable a traveller in a high latitude moving west to keep pace\r\nwith the sun, and, should he wish it, to have unending day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n               DR. CORTLANDT\'S HISTORY CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n"In marine transportation we have two methods, one for freight\r\nand another for passengers.  The old-fashioned deeply immersed\r\nship has not changed radically from the steam and sailing vessels\r\nof the last century, except that electricity has superseded all\r\nother motive powers.  Steamers gradually passed through the five\r\nhundred-, six hundred-, and seven hundred-foot-long class, with\r\nother dimensions in proportion, till their length exceeded one\r\nthousand feet.  These were very fast ships, crossing the Atlantic\r\nin four and a half days, and were almost as steady as houses, in\r\neven the roughest weather.\r\n\r\n"Ships at this period of their development had also passed\r\nthrough the twin and triple screw stage to the quadruple, all\r\nfour together developing one hundred and forty thousand indicated\r\nhorse-power, and being driven by steam.  This, of course,\r\ninvolved sacrificing the best part of the ship to her engines,\r\nand a very heavy idle investment while in port.  Storage\r\nbatteries, with plates composed of lead or iron, constantly\r\nincreasing in size, had reached a fair state of development by\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n"During the second decade of the twentieth century the engineers\r\ndecided to try the plan of running half of a transatlantic\r\nliner\'s screws by electricity generated by the engines for\r\ndriving the others while the ship was in port, this having been a\r\nsuccess already on a smaller scale.  For a time this plan gave\r\ngreat satisfaction, since it diminished the amount of coal to be\r\ncarried and the consequent change of displacement at sea, and\r\nenabled the ship to be worked with a smaller number of men.  The\r\nbatteries could also, of course, be distributed along the entire\r\nlength, and placed where space was least valuable.\r\n\r\n"The construction of such huge vessels called for much\r\ngovernmental river and harbour dredging, and a ship drawing\r\nthirty-five feet can now enter New York at any state of the tide.\r\nFor ocean bars, the old system of taking the material out to sea\r\nand discharging it still survives, though a jet of water from\r\nforce-pumps directed against the obstruction is also often\r\nemployed with quick results.  For river work we have discovered a\r\nbetter method.  All the mud is run back, sometimes over a mile\r\nfrom the river bank, where it is used as a fertilizer, by means\r\nof wire railways strung from poles.  These wire cables combine in\r\nthemselves the functions of trolley wire and steel rail, and\r\ncarry the suspended cars, which empty themselves and return\r\naround the loop for another load.  Often the removed material\r\nentirely fills small, saucer-shaped valleys or low places, in\r\nwhich case it cannot wash back.  This improvement has ended the\r\nnecessity of building jetties.\r\n\r\n"The next improvement in sea travelling was the \'marine spider.\'\r\nAs the name shows, this is built on the principle of an insect.\r\nIt is well known that a body can be carried over the water much\r\nfaster than through it.  With this in mind, builders at first\r\nconstructed light framework decks on large water-tight wheels or\r\ndrums, having paddles on their circumferences to provide a hold\r\non the water.  These they caused to revolve by means of machinery\r\non the deck, but soon found that the resistance offered to the\r\nbarrel wheels themselves was too great.  They therefore made them\r\nmore like centipeds with large, bell-shaped feet, connected with\r\na superstructural deck by ankle-jointed pipes, through which,\r\nwhen necessary, a pressure of air can be forced down upon the\r\nenclosed surface of water.  Ordinarily, however, they go at great\r\nspeed without this, the weight of the water displaced by the bell\r\nfeet being as great as that resting upon them.  Thus they swing\r\nalong like a pacing horse, except that there are four rows of\r\nfeet instead of two, each foot being taken out of the water as it\r\nis swung forward, the first and fourth and second and third rows\r\nbeing worked together.  Although, on account of their size, which\r\ncovers several acres, they can go in any water, they give the\r\nbest results on Mediterraneans and lakes that are free from ocean\r\nrollers, and, under favourable conditions, make better speed than\r\nthe nineteenth-century express trains, and, of course, going\r\nstraight as the crow flies, and without stopping, they reach a\r\ndestination in considerably shorter time.\r\n\r\nSome passengers and express packages still cross the Atlantic on\r\n\'spiders,\' but most of these light cargoes go in a far pleasanter\r\nand more rapid way.  The deep-displacement vessels, for heavy\r\nfreight, make little better speed than was made by the same class\r\na hundred years ago.  But they are also run entirely by\r\nelectricity, largely supplied by wind, and by the tide turning\r\ntheir motors, which become dynamos while at anchor in any stream.\r\nThey therefore need no bulky boilers, engines, sails, or\r\ncoal-bunkers, and consequently can carry unprecedentedly large\r\ncargoes with comparatively small crews.  The officers on the\r\nbridge and the men in the crow\'s nest--the way to which is by a\r\nladder INSIDE the mast, to protect the climber from the\r\nweather--are about all that is needed; while disablement is made\r\npractically impossible, by having four screws, each with its own\r\nset of automatically lubricating motors.\r\n\r\n"This change, like other labour-saving appliances, at first\r\nresulted in laying off a good many men, the least satisfactory\r\nbeing the first to go; but the increase in business was so great\r\nthat the intelligent men were soon reemployed as officers at\r\nhigher rates of pay and more interesting work than before, while\r\nthey as consumers were benefited as much as any one else by the\r\ndecreased cost of production and transportation.\r\n\r\n"With a view to facilitating interchange still further, our\r\nGovernment has gradually completed the double coast-line that\r\nNature gave us in part.  This was done by connecting islands\r\nseparated from shore by navigable water, and leaving openings for\r\ningress and exit but a few hundred yards wide.  The breakwaters\r\nrequired to do this were built with cribbing of incorrodible\r\nmetal, affixed to deeply driven metallic piles, and filled with\r\nstones along coasts where they were found in abundance or excess.\r\nThis, while clearing many fields and improving them for\r\ncultivation, provided just the needed material; since irregular\r\nstones bind together firmly, and, while also insoluble, combine\r\nconsiderable bulk with weight.  South of Hatteras, where stones\r\nare scarce, the sand dredged from parts of the channel was filled\r\ninto the crib, the surface of which has a concave metallic cover,\r\na trough of still water being often the best barrier against the\r\npassage of waves.  This double coast-line has been a great\r\nbenefit, and propelled vessels of moderate draught can range in\r\nsmooth water, carrying very full loads, from Labrador to the\r\nOrinoco.  The exits are, of course, protected by a line of\r\ncribbing a few hundred feet to seaward.\r\n\r\n"The rocks have been removed from all channels about New York and\r\nother commercial centres, while the shallow places have been\r\ndredged to a uniform depth.  This diminishes the dangers of\r\nnavigation and considerably decreases the speed with which the\r\ntides rush through.  Where the obstructions consisted of reefs\r\nsurrounded by deep water, their removal with explosives was easy,\r\nthe shattered fragments being allowed to sink to the bottom and\r\nremain there beneath the danger line.\r\n\r\n"Many other great works have also been completed.  The canals at\r\nNicaragua have been in operation many years, it having been found\r\nbest to have several sizes of locks, and to use the large ones\r\nonly for the passage of large vessels.  The improved Erie and\r\nChamplain Canals also enable ships four hundred feet long to\r\nreach New York from the Great Lakes via the Hudson River.\r\n\r\n"For flying, we have an aeroplane that came in when we devised a\r\nsuitable motor power.  This is obtained from very light\r\npaper-cell batteries that combine some qualities of the primary\r\nand secondary type, since they must first be charged from a\r\ndynamo, after which they can supply full currents for one hundred\r\nhours--enough to take them around the globe--while partly\r\nconsuming the elements in the cells.  The power is applied\r\nthrough turbine screws, half of which are capable of propelling\r\nthe flat deck in its inclined position at sufficient speed to\r\nprevent its falling.  The moving parts have ball bearings and\r\nfriction rollers, lubrication being secured automatically, when\r\nrequired, by a supply of vaseline that melts if any part becomes\r\nhot.  All the framing is of thin but very durable galvanized\r\naluminum, which has superseded steel for every purpose in which\r\nweight is not an advantage, as in the permanent way on railways.\r\nThe air ships, whose length varies from fifty to five hundred\r\nfeet, have rudders for giving a vertical or a horizontal motion,\r\nand several strengthening keels that prevent leeway when turning.\r\nThey are entirely on the principle of birds, maintaining\r\nthemselves mechanically, and differing thus from the unwieldy\r\nballoon.  Starting as if on a circular railway, against the wind,\r\nthey rise to a considerable height, and then, shutting off the\r\nbatteries, coast down the aerial slope at a rate that sometimes\r\ntouches five hundred miles an hour.  When near the ground the\r\nhelmsman directs the prow upward, and, again turning on full\r\ncurrent, rushes up the slope at a speed that far exceeds the\r\neagle\'s, each drop of two miles serving to take the machine\r\ntwenty or thirty; though, if the pilot does not wish to soar, or\r\nif there is a fair wind at a given height, he can remain in that\r\nstratum of the atmosphere by moving horizontally.  He can also\r\nmaintain his elevation when moving very slowly, and though the\r\nheadway be entirely stopped, the descent is gradual on account of\r\nthe aeroplane\'s great spread, the batteries and motors being\r\nsecured to the under side of the deck.\r\n\r\n"The motors are so light that they develop two horse power for\r\nevery pound of their weight; while, to keep the frames thin, the\r\nnecessary power is obtained by terrific speed of the moving\r\nparts, as though a steam engine, to avoid great pressure in its\r\ncylinders, had a long stroke and ran at great piston speed,\r\nwhich, however, is no disadvantage to the rotary motion of the\r\nelectric motor, there being no reciprocating cranks, etc., that\r\nmust be started and stopped at each revolution.\r\n\r\n"To obviate the necessity of gearing to reduce the number of\r\nrevolutions to those possible for a large screw, this member is\r\nmade very small, and allowed to revolve three thousand times a\r\nminute, so that the requisite power is obtained with great\r\nsimplicity of mechanism, which further decreases friction.  The\r\nshafts, and even the wires connecting the batteries with the\r\nmotors, are made large and hollow.  Though the primary battery\r\npure and simple, as the result of great recent advances in\r\nchemistry, seems to be again coming up, the best aeroplane\r\nbatteries are still of the combination- storage type.  These have\r\nbeen so perfected that eight ounces of battery yield one horse\r\npower for six hours, so that two pounds of battery will supply a\r\nhorse power for twenty-four hours; a small fifty-horse-power\r\naeroplane being therefore able to fly four days with a battery\r\nweight of but four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n"Limestone and clarified acid are the principal parts of these\r\nbatteries.  It was known long ago that there was about as much\r\nimprisoned solar energy in limestone as in coal, but it was only\r\nrecently that we discovered this way of releasing and using it.\r\n\r\n"Common salt plays an important part in many of our chemical\r\nreactions.  By combining it with limestone, and treating this\r\nwith acid jelly, we also get good results on raising to the\r\nboiling-point.\r\n\r\n"However enjoyable the manly sport of yachting is on water, how\r\nvastly more interesting and fascinating it is for a man to have a\r\nyacht in which he can fly to Europe in one day, and with which\r\nthe exploration of tropical Africa or the regions about the poles\r\nis mere child\'s play, while giving him so magnificent a\r\nbird\'s-eye view!  Many seemingly insoluble problems are solved by\r\nthe advent of these birds.  Having as their halo the enforcement\r\nof peace, they have in truth taken us a long step towards heaven,\r\nand to the co-operation and higher civilization that followed we\r\nshall owe much of the success of the great experiment on Mother\r\nEarth now about to be tried.\r\n\r\n"Another change that came in with a rush upon the discovery of a\r\nbattery with insignificant weight, compact form, and great\r\ncapacity, was the substitution of electricity for animal power\r\nfor the movement of all vehicles.  This, of necessity brought in\r\ngood roads, the results obtainable on such being so much greater\r\nthan on bad ones that a universal demand for them arose.  This\r\nwas in a sense cumulative, since the better the streets and roads\r\nbecame, the greater the inducement to have an electric carriage.\r\nThe work of opening up the country far and near, by straightening\r\nand improving existing roads, and laying out new ones that\r\ncombine the solidity of the Appian Way with the smoothness of\r\nmodern asphalt, was largely done by convicts, working under the\r\ndirection of State and Government engineers.  Every State\r\ncontained a horde of these unprofitable boarders, who, as they\r\nformerly worked, interfered with honest labour, and when idle got\r\ninto trouble.  City streets had been paved by the municipality;\r\ncountry roads attended to by the farmers, usually very\r\nunscientifically.  Here was a field in which convict labour would\r\nnot compete, and an important work could be done.  When once this\r\nwas made the law, every year showed improvement, while the\r\nconvicts had useful and healthful occupation.\r\n\r\n"The electric phaetons, as those for high speed are called, have\r\nthree and four wheels, and weigh, including battery and motor,\r\nfive hundred to four thousand pounds.  With hollow but immensely\r\nstrong galvanically treated aluminum frames and pneumatic or\r\ncushion tires, they run at thirty-five and forty miles an hour on\r\ncountry roads, and attain a speed over forty on city streets, and\r\ncan maintain this rate without recharging for several days.  They\r\ncan therefore roam over the roads of the entire hemisphere, from\r\nthe fertile valley of the Peace and grey shores of Hudson Bay, to\r\nbeautiful Lake Nicaragua, the River Plate, and Patagonia,\r\nimproving man by bringing him close to Nature, while they combine\r\nthe sensations of coasting with the interest of seeing the\r\ncountry well.\r\n\r\n"To recharge the batteries, which can be done in almost every\r\ntown and village, two copper pins attached to insulated copper\r\nwires are shoved into smooth-bored holes.  These drop out of\r\nthemselves by fusing a small lead ribbon, owing to the increased\r\nresistance, when the acid in the batteries begins to \'boil,\'\r\nthough there is, of course, but little heat in this, the function\r\nof charging being merely to bring about the condition in which\r\npart of the limestone can be consumed, the batteries themselves,\r\nwhen in constant use, requiring to be renewed about once a month.\r\nA handle at the box seat turns on any part of the attainable\r\ncurrent, for either going ahead or reversing, there being six or\r\neight degrees of speed for both directions, while the steering is\r\ndone with a small wheel.\r\n\r\n"Light but powerful batteries and motors have also been fitted on\r\nbicycles, which can act either as auxiliaries for hill-climbing\r\nor in case of head wind, or they can propel the machine\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n"Gradually the width of the streets became insufficient for the\r\ntraffic, although the elimination of horses and the consequent\r\nincrease in speed greatly augmented their carrying capacity,\r\nuntil recently a new system came in.  The whole width of the\r\navenues and streets in the business parts of the city, including\r\nthe former sidewalks, is given up to wheel traffic, an iron ridge\r\nextending along the exact centre to compel vehicles to keep to\r\nthe right.  Strips of nickel painted white, and showing a bright\r\nphosphorescence at night, are let into the metal pavement flush\r\nwith the surface, and run parallel to this ridge at distances of\r\nten to fifteen feet, dividing each half of the avenue into four\r\nor five sections, their width increasing as they approach the\r\nmiddle.  All trucks or drays moving at less than seven miles an\r\nhour are obliged to keep in the section nearest the building\r\nline, those running between seven and fifteen in the next,\r\nfifteen to twenty-five in the third, twenty-five to thirty-five\r\nin the fourth, and everything faster than that in the section\r\nnext the ridge, unless the avenue or street is wide enough for\r\nfurther subdivisions.  If it is wide enough for only four or\r\nless, the fastest vehicles must keep next the middle, and limit\r\ntheir speed to the rate allowed in that section, which is marked\r\nat every crossing in white letters sufficiently large for him\r\nthat runs to read.  It is therefore only in the wide\r\nthoroughfares that very high speed can be attained.  In addition\r\nto the crank that corresponds to a throttle, there is a gauge on\r\nevery vehicle, which shows its exact speed in miles per hour, by\r\ngearing operated by the revolutions of the wheels.\r\n\r\n"The policemen on duty also have instantaneous kodaks mounted on\r\ntripods, which show the position of any carriage at half- and\r\nquarter-second intervals, by which it is easy to ascertain the\r\nexact speed, should the officers be unable to judge it by the\r\neye; so there is no danger of a vehicle\'s speed exceeding that\r\nallowed in the section in which it happens to be; neither can a\r\nslow one remain on the fast lines.\r\n\r\n"Of course, to make such high speed for ordinary carriages\r\npossible, a perfect pavement became a sine qua non.  We have\r\nsecured this by the half-inch sheet of steel spread over a\r\ncarefully laid surface of asphalt, with but little bevel; and\r\nthough this might be slippery for horses\' feet, it never\r\nseriously affects our wheels.  There being nothing harder than\r\nthe rubber ties of comparatively light drays upon it--for the\r\nheavy traffic is carried by electric railways under ground--it\r\nwill practically never wear out.\r\n\r\n"With the application of steel to the entire surface, car-tracks\r\nbecame unnecessary, ordinary wheels answering as well as those\r\nwith flanges, so that no new tracks were laid, and finally the\r\ncar companies tore up the existing ones, selling them in many\r\ninstances to the municipalities as old iron.  Our streets also\r\nneed but little cleaning; neither is the surface continually\r\nindented, as the old cobble-stones and Belgian blocks were, by\r\nthe pounding of the horses\' feet, so that the substitution of\r\nelectricity for animal power has done much to solve the problem\r\nof attractive streets.\r\n\r\n"Scarcely a ton of coal comes to Manhattan Island or its vicinity\r\nin a year.  Very little of it leaves the mines, at the mouths of\r\nwhich it is converted into electricity and sent to the points of\r\nconsumption by wire, where it is employed for all uses to which\r\nfuel was put, and many others.  Consequently there is no smoke,\r\nand the streets are not encumbered with coal-carts; the entire\r\nwidth being given up to carriages, etc.  The ground floors in the\r\nbusiness parts are used for large warehouses, trucks running in\r\nto load and unload.  Pedestrians therefore have sidewalks level\r\nwith the second story, consisting of glass floors let into\r\naluminum frames, while all street crossings are made on bridges.\r\nPrivate houses have a front door opening on the  sidewalk, and\r\nanother on the ground level, so that ladies paying visits or\r\nleaving cards can do so in carriages.  In business streets the\r\nsecond story is used for shops.  In place of steel covering,\r\ncountry roads have a thick coating of cement and asphalt over a\r\nfoundation of crushed stone, giving a capital surface, and have a\r\nwidth of thirty-three feet (two rods) in thinly settled\r\ndistricts, to sixty-six feet (four rods) where the population is\r\ngreater.  All are planted with shade and fruit trees, while the\r\nwide driveways have one or two broad sidewalks.  The same rule of\r\nmaking the slow-moving vehicles keep near the outside prevails,\r\nthough the rate of increase in speed on approaching the middle is\r\nmore rapid than in cities, and there is usually no dividing\r\nridge.  On reaching the top of a long and steep hill, if we do\r\nnot wish to coast, we convert the motors into dynamos, while\r\nrunning at full speed, and so change the kinetic energy of the\r\ndescent into potential in our batteries.  This twentieth-century\r\nstage-coaching is one of the delights to which we are heirs,\r\nthough horses are still used by those that prefer them.\r\n\r\nWe have been much aided in our material progress by the facility\r\nwith which we obtain the metals.  It was observed, some time ago,\r\nthat when artesian and oil wells had reached a considerable\r\ndepth, what appeared to be drops of lead and antimony came up\r\nwith the stream.  It finally occurred to a well-borer that if he\r\ncould make his drill hard enough and get it down far enough,\r\nkeeping it cool by solidified carbonic acid during the\r\nproceeding, he would reach a point at which most of the metals\r\nwould be viscous, if not actually molten, and on being freed from\r\nthe pressure of the crust they would expand, and reach the\r\nsurface in a stream.  This experiment he performed near the hot\r\ngeysers in Yellowstone Park, and what was his delight, on\r\nreaching a depth scarcely half a mile beyond his usual stopping-\r\nplace, to be rewarded by a stream of metal that heralded its\r\napproach by a loud explosion and a great rush of superheated\r\nsteam!  It ran for a month, completely filling the bed of a\r\nsmall, dried-up river, and when it did stop there were ten\r\nmillion tons in sight.  This proved the feasibility of the\r\nscheme, and, though many subsequent attempts were less\r\nsuccessful, we have learned by experience where it is best to\r\ndrill, and can now obtain almost any metal we wish.\r\n\r\n"\'Magnetic eyes\' are of great use to miners and Civil engineers.\r\nThese instruments are something like the mariner\'s compass, with\r\nthe sensitiveness enormously increased by galvanic currents.  The\r\n\'eye,\' as it were, sees what substances are underground, and at\r\nwhat distances.  It also shows how many people are in an\r\nadjoining room--through the magnetic properties of the iron in\r\ntheir blood--whether they are moving, and in what directions and\r\nat what speed they go.  In connection with the phonograph and\r\nconcealed by draperies, it is useful to detectives, who, through\r\na registering attachment, can obtain a record of everything said\r\nand done.\r\n\r\n"Our political system remains with but little change.  Each State\r\nhas still two United States Senators, though the population\r\nrepresented by each representative has been greatly increased, so\r\nthat the Senate has grown numerically much more than the House.\r\nIt is the duty of each member of Congress to understand the\r\nconditions existing in every other member\'s State or district,\r\nand the country\'s interest always precedes that of party.  We\r\nhave a comprehensive examination system in the civil service, and\r\nevery officeholder, except members of the Cabinet, retains his\r\noffice while efficiently performing his duty, without regard to\r\npolitics.  The President can also be re-elected any number of\r\ntimes.  The Cabinet members, as formerly, usually remain in\r\noffice while he does, and appear regularly in Congress to defend\r\ntheir measures.\r\n\r\n"The really rapid transit lines in New York are underground, and\r\nhave six tracks, two being used for freight.  At all stations the\r\nlocal tracks rise several feet towards the street and slope off\r\nin both directions, while the express tracks do this only at\r\nstations at which the faster trains stop.  This gives the\r\npassengers a shorter distance to descend or rise in the\r\nelevators, and the ascent before the stations aids the brakes in\r\nstopping, while the drop helps the motors to start the trains\r\nquickly in getting away.\r\n\r\n"Photography has also made great strides, and there is now no\r\ndifficulty in reproducing exactly the colours of the object\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n"Telephones have been so improved that one person can speak in\r\nhis natural voice with another in any part of the globe, the wire\r\nthat enables him to hear also showing him the face of the speaker\r\nthough he be at the antipodes.  All telephone wires being\r\nunderground and kept by themselves, they are not interfered with\r\nby any high-tension electric-light or power wires, thunderstorms,\r\nor anything else.\r\n\r\n"Rain-making is another subject removed from the uncertainties,\r\nand has become an absolute science.  We produce clouds by\r\nexplosions in the atmosphere\'s heights and by surface air forced\r\nby blowers through large pipes up the side of a mountain or\r\nnatural elevation and there discharged through an opening in the\r\ntop of a tower built on the highest part.  The aeriduct is\r\nincased in a poor heat-conductor, so that the air retains its\r\nwarmth until discharged, when it is cooled by expansion and the\r\nsurrounding cold air.  Condensation takes place and soon serves\r\nto start a rain.\r\n\r\n"Yet, until the earth\'s axis is straightened, we must be more or\r\nless dependent on the eccentricities of the weather, with\r\nextremes of heat and cold, droughts and floods, which last are of\r\ncourse largely the result of several months\' moisture held on the\r\nground in the form of snow, the congestion being relieved\r\nsuddenly by the warm spring rains.\r\n\r\n"Medicine and surgery have kept pace with other\r\nimprovements--inoculation and antiseptics, as already seen,\r\nrendering most of the germ diseases and formerly dreaded\r\nepidemics impotent; while through the potency of electrical\r\naffinity we form wholesome food-products rapidly, instead of\r\nhaving to wait for their production by Nature\'s slow processes.\r\n\r\n"The metric system, now universal, superseded the old-fashioned\r\narbitrary standards, so prolific of mistakes and confusion, about\r\na century ago.\r\n\r\n"English, as we have seen, is already the language of 600,000,000\r\npeople, and the number is constantly increasing through its\r\nadoption by the numerous races of India, where, even before the\r\nclose of the last century, it was about as important as Latin\r\nduring the greatness of Rome, and by the fact that the Spanish\r\nand Portuguese elements in Mexico and Central and South America\r\nshow a constant tendency to die out, much as the population of\r\nSpain fell from 30,000,000 to 17,000,000 during the nineteenth\r\ncentury.  As this goes on, in the Western hemisphere, the places\r\nleft vacant are gradually filled by the more progressive\r\nAnglo-Saxons, so that it looks as if the study of ethnology in\r\nthe future would be very simple.\r\n\r\n"The people with cultivation and leisure, whose number is\r\nincreasing relatively to the population at each generation, spend\r\nmuch more of their year in the country than formerly, where they\r\nhave large and well-cultivated country seats, parts of which are\r\nalso preserved for game.  This growing custom on the part of\r\nsociety, in addition to being of great advantage to the\r\nout-of-town districts, has done much to save the forests and\r\npreserve some forms of game that would otherwise, like the\r\nbuffalo, have become extinct.\r\n\r\n"In astronomy we have also made tremendous strides.  The\r\nold-fashioned double-convex lens used in telescopes became so\r\nheavy as its size grew, that it bent perceptibly from its own\r\nweight, when pointed at the zenith, distorting the vision; while\r\nwhen it was used upon a star near the horizon, though the glass\r\non edge kept its shape, there was too much atmosphere between it\r\nand the observed object for successful study.  Our recent\r\ntelescopes have, therefore, concave plate-glass mirrors, twenty\r\nmetres in diameter, like those used for converging the sun\'s rays\r\nin solar engines, but with curves more mathematically exact,\r\nwhich collect an immense amount of light and focus it on a\r\nsensitive plate or on the eye of the observer, whose back is\r\nturned to the object he is studying.  An electrical field also\r\nplays an important part, the electricity being as great an aid to\r\nlight as in the telephone it is to sound.  With these placed\r\ngenerally on high mountain peaks, beyond the reach of clouds, we\r\nhave enormously increased the number of visible stars, though\r\nthere are still probably boundless regions that we cannot see.\r\nThese telescopes have several hundred times the power of the\r\nlargest lenses of the nineteenth century, and apparently bring\r\nMars and Jupiter, when in opposition, within one thousand and ten\r\nthousand miles, respectively, so that we study their physical\r\ngeography and topography; and we have good maps of Jupiter, and\r\neven of Saturn, notwithstanding their distance and atmospheric\r\nenvelopes, and we are able to see the disks of third-magnitude\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n"It seems as if, when we wish any particular discovery or\r\ninvention, in whatever field, we had but to turn our efforts in\r\nits direction to obtain our desire.  We seem, in fact, to have\r\nawakened in the scenes of the Arabian Nights; yet the mysterious\r\ngenius which we control, and which dims Aladdin\'s lamp, is the\r\ngift of no fairy godmother sustained by the haze of dreams, but\r\nshines as the child of science with fadeless and growing\r\nsplendour, and may yet bring us and our little planet much closer\r\nto God.\r\n\r\n"We should indeed be happy, living as we do at this apex of\r\nattained civilization, with the boundless possibilities of the\r\nfuture unfolding before us, on the horizon of which we may fairly\r\nbe said to stand.\r\n\r\n"We are freed from the rattling granite pavement of only a\r\ncentury ago, which made the occupant of an omnibus feel like a\r\nfly inside of a drum; from the domination of our local politics\r\nby ignorant foreigners; and from country roads that either filled\r\nthe eyes, lungs, and hair of the unfortunates travelling upon\r\nthem with dust, or, resembling ploughed and fertilized fields,\r\nsaturated and plastered them with mud.  These miseries, together\r\nwith sea-sickness in ocean travelling, are forever passed, and we\r\nfeel that \'Excelsior!\' is indeed our motto.  Our new and\r\nincreasing sources of power have so stimulated production and\r\nmanufacturing that poverty or want is scarcely known; while the\r\ndevelopment of the popular demand, as a result of the supplied\r\nneed, is so great that there is no visible limit to the\r\ndiversification of industry or the possibilities of the arts.\r\n\r\n"It may seem strange to some that apparently so disproportionate\r\na number of inventions have been made in the last century.  There\r\nare several reasons.  Since every discovery or advance in\r\nknowledge increases our chance of obtaining more, it becomes\r\ncumulative, and our progress is in geometric instead of\r\narithmetical ratio.  Public interest and general appreciation of\r\nthe value of time have also effectively assisted progress.  At\r\nthe beginning of each year the President, the Governors of the\r\nStates, and the Mayors of cities publish a prospectus of the\r\ngreat improvements needed, contemplated, and under way within\r\ntheir jurisdiction--it may be planning a new boulevard, a new\r\npark, or an improved system of sewers; and at the year\'s end they\r\nissue a resume of everything completed, and the progress in\r\neverything else; and though there is usually a great difference\r\nbetween the results hoped for and those attained, the effect is\r\ngood.  The newspapers publish at length the recommendations of\r\nthe Executives, and also the results obtained, and keep up public\r\ninterest in all important matters.\r\n\r\n"Free to delve in the allurement and fascination of science,\r\nemancipated man goes on subduing Nature, as his Maker said he\r\nshould, and turning her giant forces to his service in his\r\nconstant struggle to rise and become more like Him who gave the\r\ncommandments and showed him how he should go.\r\n\r\n"Notwithstanding our strides in material progress,  we are not\r\nentirely content.  As the requirements of the animal become fully\r\nsupplied, we feel a need for something else.  Some say this is\r\nlike a child that cries for the moon, but others believe it the\r\nawakening and craving of our souls.  The historian narrates but\r\nthe signs of the times, and strives to efface himself; yet there\r\nis clearly a void, becoming yearly more apparent, which\r\nmaterialism cannot fill.  Is it some new subtle force for which\r\nwe sigh, or would we commune with spirits?  There is, so far as\r\nwe can see, no limit to our journey, and I will add, in closing,\r\nthat, with the exception of religion, we have most to hope from\r\nscience."\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                       FAR-REACHING PLANS.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the rectification of the earth\'s axis was\r\nsatisfactorily begun, and that each year would show an increasing\r\nimprovement in climate, many of the delegates, after hearing\r\nBearwarden\'s speech, set out for their homes.  Those from the\r\nvalley of the Amazon and the eastern coast of South America\r\nboarded a lightning express that rushed them to Key West at the\r\nrate of three hundred miles an hour.  The railroad had six\r\ntracks, two for through passengers, two for locals, and two for\r\nfreight.  There they took a "water-spider," six hundred feet long\r\nby three hundred in width, the deck of which was one hundred feet\r\nabove the surface, which carried them over the water at the rate\r\nof a mile a minute, around the eastern end of Cuba, through\r\nWindward Passage, and so to the South American mainland, where\r\nthey continued their journey by rail.\r\n\r\nThe Siberian and Russian delegates, who, of course, felt a keen\r\ninterest in the company\'s proceedings, took a magnetic\r\ndouble-ender car to Bering Strait.  It was eighteen feet high,\r\none hundred and fifty feet long, and had two stories.  The upper,\r\nwith a toughened glass dome running the entire length, descended\r\nto within three feet of the floor, and afforded an unobstructed\r\nview of the rushing scenery.  The rails on which it ran were ten\r\nfeet apart, the wheels being beyond the sides, like those of a\r\ncarriage, and fitted with ball bearings to ridged axles.  The\r\ncar\'s flexibility allowed it to follow slight irregularities in\r\nthe track, while the free, independent wheels gave it a great\r\nadvantage in rounding curves over cars with wheels and axle in\r\none casting, in which one must slip while traversing a greater or\r\nsmaller arc than the other, except when the slope of the tread\r\nand the centrifugal force happen to correspond exactly.  The fact\r\nof having its supports outside instead of underneath, while\r\nincreasing its stability, also enabled the lower floor to come\r\nmuch nearer the ground, while still the wheels were large.\r\nArriving in just twenty hours, they ran across on an electric\r\nferry-boat, capable of carrying several dozen cars, to East Cape,\r\nSiberia, and then, by running as far north as possible, had a\r\nshort cut to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Patagonians went by the all-rail Intercontinental Line,\r\nwithout change of cars, making the run of ten thousand miles in\r\nforty hours.  The Australians entered a flying machine, and were\r\nsoon out of sight; while the Central Americans and members from\r\nother States of the Union returned for the most part in their\r\nmechanical phaetons.\r\n\r\n"A prospective improvement in travelling," said Bearwarden, as he\r\nand his friends watched the crowd disperse, "will be when we can\r\nrise beyond the limits of the atmosphere, wait till the earth\r\nrevolves beneath us, and descend in twelve hours on the other\r\nside."\r\n\r\n"True," said Cortlandt, "but then we can travel westward only,\r\nand shall have to make a complete circuit when we wish to go\r\neast."\r\n\r\nA few days later there was a knock at President Bearwarden\'s\r\ndoor, while he was seated at his desk looking over some papers\r\nand other matters.  Taking his foot from a partly opened desk\r\ndrawer where it had been resting, he placed it upon the handle of\r\na handsome brass-mounted bellows, which proved to be\r\narticulating, for, as he pressed, it called lustily, "Come in!"\r\nThe door opened, and in walked Secretary of State Stillman,\r\nSecretary of the Navy Deepwaters, who was himself an old sailor,\r\nDr. Cortlandt, Ayrault.  Vice-President Dumby, of the T. A. S.\r\nCo., and two of the company\'s directors.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," said Bearwarden, as he shook hands with his\r\nvisitors.  "Charmed to see you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a great invention," said Secretary Stillman, examining\r\nthe bellows.  "We must get Congress to make an appropriation for\r\nits introduction in the department buildings in Washington.  You\r\nhave no idea how it dries my throat to be all the time shouting,\r\n\'Come in!\'"\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Bearwarden," said Secretary Deepwaters, "I\'m afraid\r\nwhen we have this millennium of climate every one will be so well\r\nsatisfied that our friend here (pointing to Secretary Stillman\r\nwith his thumb) will have nothing to do."\r\n\r\n"I have sometimes thought some of the excitement will be gone,\r\nand the struggle of the \'survival of the fittest\' will become\r\nless problematical," said Bearwarden.\r\n\r\n"The earth seems destined to have a calm old age," said\r\nCortlandt, "unless we can look to the Cabinet to prevent it."\r\n\r\n"This world will soon be a dull place.  I wish we could leave it\r\nfor a change," said Ayrault.  "I don\'t mean forever, of course,\r\nbut just as people have grown tired of remaining like plants in\r\nthe places in which they grew.  Alan has been a caterpillar for\r\nuntold ages; can he not become the butterfly?"\r\n\r\n"Since we have found out how to straighten the axis," said\r\nDeepwaters, "might we not go one better, and improve the orbit as\r\nwell?--increase the difference between aphelion and perihelion,\r\nand give those that still like a changing climate a chance, while\r\nincidentally we should see more of the world--I mean the solar\r\nsystem--and, by enlarging the parallax, be able to measure the\r\ndistance of a greater number of fixed stars.  Put your helm hard\r\ndown and shout \'Hard-a-lee!\'  You see, there is nothing simpler.\r\nYou keep her off now, and six months hence you let her luff."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an idea!" said Bearwarden.  "Our orbit could be enough\r\nlike that of a comet to cross the orbits of both Venus and Mars;\r\nand the climatic extremes would not be inconvenient.  The whole\r\nearth being simultaneously warmed or cooled, there would be no\r\nequinoctials or storms resulting from changes on one part of the\r\nsurface from intense heat to intense cold; every part would have\r\na twelve-hour day and night, and none would be turned towards or\r\nfrom the sun for six months at a time; for, however eccentric the\r\norbit, we should keep the axis absolutely straight.  At\r\nperihelion there would simply be increased evaporation and clouds\r\nnear the equator, which would shield those regions from the sun,\r\nonly to disappear again as the earth receded.\r\n\r\n"The only trouble," said Cortlandt, "is that we should have no\r\nfulcrum.  Straightening the axis is simple enough, for we have\r\nthe attraction of the sun with which to work, and we have but to\r\nincrease it at one end while decreasing it at the other, and\r\nchange this as the poles change their inclination towards the\r\nsun, to bring it about.  If a comet with a sufficiently large\r\nhead would but come along and retard us, or opportunely give us a\r\npull, or if we could increase the attraction of the other planets\r\nfor us, or decrease it at times, it might be done.  If the force,\r\nthe control of which was discovered too late to help us\r\nstraighten the axis, could be applied on a sufficiently large\r\nscale; if apergy----"\r\n\r\n"I have it!" exclaimed Ayrault, jumping up.  "Apergy will do it.\r\nWe can build an airtight projectile, hermetically seal ourselves\r\nwithin, and charge it in such a way that it will be repelled by\r\nthe magnetism of the earth, and it will be forced from it with\r\nequal or greater violence than that with which it is ordinarily\r\nattracted.  I believe the earth has but the same relation to\r\nspace that the individual molecule has to any solid, liquid, or\r\ngaseous matter we know; and that, just as molecules strive to fly\r\napart on the application of heat, this earth will repel that\r\nprojectile when electricity, which we are coming to look upon as\r\nanother form of heat, is properly applied.  It must be so, and it\r\nis the manifest destiny of the race to improve it.  Man is a\r\nspirit cursed with a mortal body, which glues him to the earth,\r\nand his yearning to rise, which is innate, is, I believe, only a\r\npart of his probation and trial."\r\n\r\n"Show us how it can be done," shouted his listeners in chorus.\r\n\r\n"Apergy is and must be able to do it," Ayrault continued.\r\n"Throughout Nature we find a system of compensation.  The\r\ncentripetal force is offset by the centrifugal; and when,\r\naccording to the fable, the crystal complained of its hard lot in\r\nbeing unable to move, while the eagle could soar through the\r\nupper air and see all the glories of the world, the bird replied,\r\n\'My life is but for a moment, while you, set in the rock, will\r\nlive forever, and will see the last sunrise that flashes upon the\r\nearth.\'\r\n\r\n"We know that Christ, while walking on the waves, did not sink,\r\nand that he and Elijah were carried up into heaven.  What became\r\nof their material bodies we cannot  tell, but they were certainly\r\nsuperior to the force of gravitation.  We have no reason to\r\nbelieve that in miracles any natural law was broken, or even set\r\naside, but simply that some other law, whose workings we do not\r\nunderstand, became operative and modified the law that otherwise\r\nwould have had things its own way.  In apergy we undoubtedly have\r\nthe counterpart of gravitation, which must exist, or Nature\'s\r\nsystem of compensation is broken.  May we not believe that in\r\nChrist\'s transfiguration on the mount, and in the appearance of\r\nMoses and Elias with him--doubtless in the flesh, since otherwise\r\nmortal eyes could not have seen them--apergy came into play and\r\nupheld them; that otherwise, and if no other modification had\r\nintervened, they would have fallen to the ground; and that apergy\r\nwas, in other words, the working principle of those miracles?"\r\n\r\n"May we not also believe," added Cortlandt, "that in the\r\ntransfiguration Christ\'s companions took the substance of their\r\nmaterial bodies--the oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon--from\r\nthe air and the moisture it contained; for, though spiritual\r\nbodies, be their activity magnetic or any other, could of course\r\npass the absolute cold and void of space without being affected,\r\nno mortal body could; and that in the same manner Elijah\'s body\r\ndissolved into air without the usual intervention of\r\ndecomposition; for we know that, though matter can easily change\r\nits form, it can never be destroyed."\r\n\r\nAll assented to this, and Ayrault continued:  "If apergy can\r\nannul gravitation, I do not see why it should not do more, for to\r\nannul it the repulsion of the earth that it produces must be as\r\ngreat as its attraction, unless we suppose gravitation for the\r\ntime being to be suspended; but whether it is or not, does not\r\naffect the result in this case, for, after the apergetic\r\nrepulsion is brought to the degree at which a body does not fall,\r\nany increase in the current\'s strength will cause it to rise, and\r\nin the case of electro-magnets we know that the attraction or\r\nrepulsion has practically no limit.  This will be of great\r\nadvantage to us," he continued, "for if a projectile could move\r\naway from the earth with no more rapid acceleration than that\r\nwith which it approaches, it would take too long to reach the\r\nnearest planet, but the maximum repulsion being at the start by\r\nreason of its proximity to the earth--for apergy, being the\r\ncounterpart of gravitation, is subject to Newton\'s and Kepler\'s\r\nlaws--the acceleration of a body apergetically charged will be\r\ngreatest at first.  Two inclined planes may have the same fall,\r\nbut a ball will reach the bottom of one that is steepest near the\r\ntop in less time than on any other, because the maximum\r\nacceleration is at the start.  We are all tired of being stuck to\r\nthis cosmical speck, with its monotonous ocean, leaden sky, and\r\nsingle moon that is useless more than half the time, while its\r\nsize is so microscopic compared with the universe that we can\r\ntraverse its great circle in four days.  Its possibilities are\r\nexhausted; and just as Greece became too small for the\r\ncivilization of the Greeks, and as reproduction is growth beyond\r\nthe individual, so it seems to me that the future glory of the\r\nhuman race lies in exploring at least the solar system, without\r\nwaiting to become shades."\r\n\r\n"Should you propose to go to Mars or Venus?" asked Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Ayrault, "we know all about Mars; it is but one\r\nseventh the size of the earth, and as the axis is inclined more\r\nthan ours, it would be a less comfortable globe than this; while,\r\nas our president here told us in his T. A. S. Company\'s report,\r\nthe axis of Venus is inclined to such a degree that it would be\r\nalmost uninhabitable for us.  It would be as if colonists tried\r\nto settle Greenland, or had come to North America during its\r\nGlacial period.  Neither Venus nor Mars would be a good place\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Where should you propose to go?" asked Stillman.\r\n\r\n"To Jupiter, and, if possible, after that to Saturn," replied\r\nAyrault; "the former\'s mean distance from the sun is 480,000,000\r\nmiles; but, as our president showed us, its axis is so nearly\r\nstraight that I think, with its internal warmth, there will be\r\nnothing to fear from cold.  Though, on account of the planet\'s\r\nvast size, objects on its surface weigh more than twice as much\r\nas here, if I am able to reach it by means of apergy, the same\r\nforce will enable me to regulate my weight.  Will any one go with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Splendid!" said Bearwarden.  "If Mr. Dumby, our vice-president,\r\nwill temporarily assume my office, nothing will give me greater\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\n"So will I go, if there is room for me," said Cortlandt.  "I will\r\nat once resign my place as Government expert, and consider it the\r\ngrandest event of my life."\r\n\r\n"If I were not afraid of leaving Stillman here to his own\r\ndevices, I\'d ask for a berth as well," said Deepwaters.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Stillman, "if you take any more, you will be\r\novercrowded."\r\n\r\n"Modesty forbids his saying," said Deepwaters, "that it wouldn\'t\r\ndo for the country to have all its eggs in one basket."\r\n\r\n"Are you not afraid you will find the surface hot, or even\r\nmolten?" asked Vice-President Dumby.  "With its eighty-six\r\nthousand five hundred mile diameter, the amount of original\r\ninternal heat must have been terrific."\r\n\r\n"No, said Cortlandt, "it cannot be molten, or even in the least\r\ndegree luminous, for, if it were, its satellites would be visible\r\nwhen they enter its shadow, whereas they entirely disappear."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe Jupiter\'s surface is even perceptibly warm,"\r\nsaid Bearwarden.  "We know that Algol, known to the ancients as\r\nthe \'Demon Star,\' and several other variable stars, are\r\naccompanied by a dark companion, with which they revolve about a\r\ncommon centre, and which periodically obscures part of their\r\nlight.  Now, some of these non-luminaries are nearly as large as\r\nour sun, and, of course, many hundred times the size of Jupiter.\r\nIf these bodies have lost enough heat to be invisible, Jupiter\'s\r\nsurface at least must be nearly cold."\r\n\r\n"In the phosphorescence of seawater," said Cortlandt, "and in\r\nother instances in Nature, we find light without heat, and we may\r\nsoon be able to produce it in the arts by oxidizing coal without\r\nthe intervention of the steam engine; but we never find any\r\nconsiderable heat without light."\r\n\r\n"I am convinced," said Bearwarden, "that we shall find Jupiter\r\nhabitable for intelligent beings who have been developed on a\r\nmore advanced sphere than itself, though I do not believe it has\r\nprogressed far enough in its evolution to produce them.  I expect\r\nto find it in its Palaeozoic or Mesozoic period, while over a\r\nhundred years ago the English astronomer, Chambers, thought that\r\non Saturn there was good reason for suspecting the presence of\r\nsnow."\r\n\r\n"What sort of spaceship do you propose to have?" asked the\r\nvice-president.\r\n\r\n"As you have to pass through but little air," said Deepwaters, "I\r\nshould suggest a short-stroke cylinder of large diameter, with a\r\nflat base and dome roof, composed of aluminum, or, still better,\r\nof glucinum or beryllium as it is sometimes called, which is\r\ntwice as good a conductor of electricity as aluminum, four times\r\nas strong, and is the lightest of all known metals, having a\r\nspecific gravity of only two, which last property will be of\r\ngreat use to you, for of course the more weight you have to\r\npropel the more apergetic repulsion you will have to develop."\r\n\r\n"I will get some drawing-paper I left outside in my trap," said\r\nAyrault, "when with your ideas we may arrive at something\r\ndefinite," saying which, he left the room.\r\n\r\n"He seems very cynical in his ideas of life and the world in\r\ngeneral," said Secretary Stillman, "for a man of his age, and one\r\nthat is engaged."\r\n\r\n"You see," replied Bearwarden, "his fiancee is not yet a senior,\r\nbeing in the class of two thousand and one at Vassar, and so\r\ncannot marry him for a year.  Not till next June can this sweet\r\ngirl graduate come forth with her mortar-board and sheepskin to\r\nenlighten the world and make him happy.  That is, I suspect, one\r\nreason why he proposed this trip."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                          HARD AT WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Ayrault returned with pencils, a pair of\r\ncompasses, and paper.\r\n\r\n"Let us see, in the first place," said Deepwaters, "how long the\r\njourney will take.  Since a stone falls 16.09 feet the first\r\nsecond, and 64+ feet the next, it is easy to calculate at what\r\nrate your speed would increase with the repulsion twice that of\r\nthe ordinary traction.  But I think this would be too slow.  It\r\nwill be best to treble or quadruple the apergetic charge, which\r\ncan easily be done, in which case your speed will exceed the\r\nmuzzle-velocity of a projectile from a long-range gun, in a few\r\nseconds.  As the earth\'s repulsion decreases, the attraction of\r\nmars and Jupiter will increase, and, there being no resistance,\r\nyour gait will become more and more rapid till it is necessary to\r\nreverse the charge to avoid being dashed to pieces or being\r\nconsumed like a falling star by the friction in passing through\r\nJupiter\'s atmosphere.  You can be on the safe side by checking\r\nyour speed in advance.  You must, of course, be careful to avoid\r\ncollisions with meteors and asteroids but if you do, they will be\r\nof use to you, for by attracting or repelling them you can change\r\nyour course to suit yourself, and also theirs in inverse ratio to\r\ntheir masses.  Jupiter\'s moons will be like head and stern lines\r\nin enabling you to choose the part of the surface on which you\r\nwish to land.  With apergy it is as essential to have some heavy\r\nbody on which to work, within range, as to have water about a\r\nship\'s propellers.  Whether, when apergy is developed,\r\ngravitation is temporarily annulled, or reversed like the late\r\nattraction of a magnet when the current is changed, or whether it\r\nis merely overpowered, in which case your motion will be the\r\nresultant of the two, is an unsettled and not very important\r\npoint; for, though we know but little more of the nature of\r\nelectricity than was known a hundred years ago, this does not\r\nprevent our producing and using it."\r\n\r\n"Jupiter, when in opposition," he continued, "is about\r\n380,000,000 miles from us, and it takes light, which travels at\r\nthe rate of 190,000 miles a second, just thirty-four minutes to\r\nreach the earth from Jupiter.  If we suppose the average speed of\r\nyour ship to be one- five-hundredth as great, it will take you\r\njust eleven days, nineteen hours and twenty minutes to make the\r\njourney.  You will have a fine view of Mars and the asteroids,\r\nand when 1,169,000 miles from Jupiter, will cross the orbit of\r\nCallisto, the fifth moon in distance from the giant planet.  That\r\nwill be your best point to steer by."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Ayrault, "as that will be the first member of\r\nJupiter\'s system we pass, and as it will guide us into port, it\r\nwould be a good name for our ship, and you must christen her if\r\nwe have her launched."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Deepwaters, "Miss Preston must do that; but we\r\ncertainly should have a launch, for you might have to land in the\r\nwater, and you must be sure the ship is tight."\r\n\r\n"Talking of tight ships," said Bearwarden, passing a decanter of\r\nclaret to Stillman, "may remind us that it is time to splice the\r\n\'main brace.\'  There\'s a bottle of whisky and some water just\r\nbehind you," he added to Deepwaters, "while three minutes after I\r\nring this bell," he said, pressing a button and jerking a handle\r\nmarked \'8,\' "the champagne cocktails will be on the desk."\r\n\r\n"I see you know his ways," said Stillman to Bearwarden, drooping\r\nhis eyes in Deepwaters\'s direction.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I\'ve been here before," replied Deepwaters.  "You see,\r\nwe navy men have to hustle now-a-days, and can\'t pass our time in\r\na high-backed chair, talking platitudes."\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a slight rumbling, and eight champagne\r\ncocktails, with the froth still on, and straws on a separate\r\nplate, shot in and landed on a corner of the desk.\r\n\r\n"Help yourselves, gentlemen," said Bearwarden, placing them on a\r\ntable; "I hope we shall find them cold."\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said Deepwaters to Ayrault, while rapidly making\r\nhis cocktail disappear, "the Callisto\'s cost with its outfit will\r\nbe very great, especially if you use glucinum, which, though the\r\nideal metal for the purpose, comes pretty high?  I suggest that\r\nyou apply to Congress for an appropriation.  This experiment\r\ncomes under the \'Promotion of Science Act,\' and any bill for it\r\nwould certainly pass."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," replied Ayrault; "the Callisto trip will be a\r\nprivilege and glory I would not miss, and building her will be a\r\npart of it.  I shall put in everything conducive to success, but\r\nwill come to the Government only for advice."\r\n\r\n"I will send a letter to all our ambassadors and consuls," said\r\nStillman, "to telegraph the department anything they may know or\r\nlearn that will be of use in adjusting the batteries, controlling\r\nthe machine, or anything else, and will turn over to you in a\r\nsuccinct form all information that may be relevant, for without\r\nsuch sorting you would be overwhelmed."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Deepwaters, "will order the commanders of our\r\nvessels to give you a farewell salute at starting, and to pick\r\nyou up in case you fail.  When you have demonstrated the\r\nsuitability of apergy," he continued, "and the habitability of\r\nJupiter and Saturn--,which, with their five and eight moons,\r\nrespectively, and rings thrown in, must both be vastly superior\r\nto our little second-rate globe--we will see what can be done\r\ntowards changing our orbit, and if we cannot swing a little\r\nnearer to our new world or worlds.  Then we\'ll lower, or rather\r\nraise, the boats in the shape of numerous Callistos, and have a\r\nlanding-party ready at each opposition, while a man or two can be\r\nplaced in charge of each projectile to bring it back in ballast.\r\nThus we may soon have regular interplanetary lines."\r\n\r\n"As every place seems to have been settled from some other," said\r\nCortlandt, "I do not see why, with increased scientific\r\nfacilities, history should not repeat itself, and this be the\r\npoint from which to colonize the solar system; for, for the\r\npresent at least, it would seem that we could not get beyond\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"As it will be quite an undertaking to change the orbit, said\r\nDeepwaters, "we shall have time meanwhile to absorb or run out\r\nall inferior races, so that we shall not make the mistake of\r\nextending the Tower of Babel."\r\n\r\n"He is putting on his war-paint," said Stillman, "and will soon\r\nwant a planet to himself."\r\n\r\n"I see no necessity for even changing the orbit," said\r\nBearwarden, "except for the benefit of those that remain.  If\r\nthis attempt succeeds, it can doubtless be repeated.  An increase\r\nin eccentricity would merely shorten the journey, if aphelion\r\nalways coincided with opposition, which it would not."\r\n\r\n"Let us know how you are getting on," said Deepwaters to Ayrault,\r\n"and be sure you have the Callisto properly christened.  Step\r\nlively there, landlubbers!" he called to Stillman; "I have an\r\nappointment at Washington at one, and it is now twenty minutes\r\npast twelve.  We can lunch on the way."\r\n\r\nAyrault immediately advertised for bids for the construction of a\r\nglucinum cylinder twenty-five feet in diameter, fifteen feet high\r\nat the sides, with a domed roof, bringing up the total height to\r\ntwenty-one feet, and with a small gutter about it to catch the\r\nrain on Jupiter or any other planet they might visit.  The sides,\r\nroof, and floor were to consist of two sheets, each one third of\r\nan inch thick and six inches apart, the space between to be\r\nfilled with mineral wool, as a protection against the intense\r\ncold of space.  There were also to be several keels and supports\r\nunderneath, on which the car should rest.  Large, toughened\r\nplate-glass windows were to be let into the roof and sides, and\r\nsmaller ones in the floor, all to be furnished with thick shades\r\nand curtains.  Ayrault also decided to have it divided into two\r\nstories, with ceilings six and a half to seven and a half feet\r\nhigh, respectively, with a sort of crow\'s nest or observatory at\r\nthe top; the floors to be lattice- work, like those in the\r\nengine-room of a steamer, so that when the carpets were rolled up\r\nthey should not greatly obstruct the view.  The wide, flat base\r\nand the low centre of gravity would, he saw, be of use in\r\nwithstanding the high winds that he knew often prevailed on\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible he awarded the contract, and then entering\r\nhis smart electric trap, steered for Vassar University along what\r\nwas the old post-road--though its builders would not have\r\nrecognized it with its asphalt surface, straightened curves, and\r\neasy grades--to ask his idol to christen the Callisto when it\r\nshould be finished.\r\n\r\nStarting from the upper end of Central Park, he stopped to buy\r\nher a bunch of violets, and then ran to Poughkeepsie in two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nSylvia Preston was a lovely girl, with blue eyes, brown hair, and\r\nperfect figure, clear white skin, and just twenty.  She was\r\ndelighted to see him, and said she would love to christen the\r\nCallisto or do anything else that he wished.  "But I am so sorry\r\nyou are going away," she went on.  "I hate to lose you for so\r\nlong, and we shall not even be able to write."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t we be married now," he asked, "and go to Jupiter\r\nfor our honeymoon?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, dear," she answered, "you would be sorry a few years\r\nhence if I didn\'t take my degree; and, besides, as you have asked\r\nthose other men, there wouldn\'t be room for me."\r\n\r\n"We could have made other arrangements," he replied, "had I been\r\nable to persuade you to go."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you dine with us at Delmonico\'s this evening, and go to\r\nthe play?" she asked.  "Papa has taken a box."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will," he said, brightening up.  "What are you going\r\nto wear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose something light and cool, for it\'s so hot," she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go now, so as to be ready," he said, getting up and going\r\ntowards the door to which Sylvia followed him.\r\n\r\nA man in livery stood at the step of the phaeton.  Ayrault got in\r\nand turned on the current, and his man climbed up behind.\r\n\r\nOn turning into the main road Ayrault was about to increase his\r\nspeed, when Sylvia, who had taken a short cut appeared at the\r\nwayside carrying her hat in one hand and her gloves in the other.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t let you go all by yourself," she said.  "The fact is,\r\nI wanted to be with you."\r\n\r\n"You are the sweetest thing that ever lived, and I\'ll love you\r\nall my days," he said, getting down and helping Sylvia to the\r\nseat beside him.  "What a nuisance this fellow behind is!" he\r\ncontinued--referring to the groom-- "for, though he is a Russian,\r\nand speaks but little English, it is unpleasant to feel he is\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to write your sweet nothings, instead of saying\r\nthem," Sylvia replied.\r\n\r\n"For you to leave around for other girls to see," answered\r\nAyrault with a smile.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what your other girls do," she returned, "but with\r\nme you are safe."\r\n\r\nAyrault fairly made his phaeton spin, going up the grades like a\r\nshot and down like a bird.  On reaching New York, he left Sylvia\r\nat her house, then ran his machine to a florist\'s, where he\r\nordered some lilies and roses, and then steered his way to his\r\nclub, where he dressed for dinner.  Shortly before the time he\r\nrepaired to Delmonico\'s--which name had become historical, though\r\nthe founders themselves were long dead--and sat guard at a table\r\ntill Sylvia, wearing his flowers and looking more beautiful than\r\nany of them, arrived with her mother and father, and Bearwarden,\r\nwhom they knew very well.\r\n\r\n"How are the exams getting on, Miss Preston?" Bearwarden asked.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well," she replied, with a smile.  "We had English\r\nliterature yesterday, and natural history the day before.  Next\r\nweek we have chemistry and philosophy."\r\n\r\n"What are you taking in natural history?" asked Bearwarden, with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, principally physical geography, geology, and meteorology,"\r\nshe replied.  "I think them entrancing."\r\n\r\n"It must be a consolation," said Ayrault, "when your best hat is\r\nspoiled by rain, to know the reason why.  Your average," he\r\ncontinued, addressing Sylvia, "was ninety in the semi-annuals,\r\nand I haven\'t a doubt that the finals will maintain your record\r\nfor the year."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be too sure," she replied.  "I have been loafing awfully,\r\nand had to engage a \'grind\' as a coach."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they went to the play, where they saw a presentation\r\nof Society at the Close of the Twentieth Century, which Sylvia\r\nand Ayrault enjoyed immensely.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Delmonico dinner, while Bearwarden,\r\nCortlandt, and Ayrault sat together discussing their plans, the\r\nservant announced Ayrault\'s family physician, Dr. Tubercle\r\nGerminy, who had been requested to call.\r\n\r\n"Delighted to see you, doctor," said Ayrault, shaking hands.\r\n"You know Col. Bearwarden, our President, and Dr. Cortlandt--an\r\nLL. D., however, and not a medico."\r\n\r\n"I have had the pleasure," replied Dr. Germiny, shaking hands\r\nwith both.\r\n\r\n"As you may be aware, doctor," said Ayrault, when they were\r\nseated, "we are about to take a short trip to Jupiter, and, if\r\ntime allows, to Saturn.  We have come to you, as one familiar\r\nwith every known germ, for a few precautionary suggestions and\r\nadvice concerning our medicine-chest."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" replied Dr. Germiny, "a thorough knowledge of\r\nbacteriology is the groundwork of therapeutics.  It is\r\npractically admitted that every ailment, with the exception of\r\nmechanical injuries, is the direct result of a specific germ; and\r\neven in accidents and simple fractures, no matter what may be the\r\nnature of the bruise, a micro-organism soon announces its\r\npresence, so that if not the parent, it is the inseparable\r\ncompanion, in fact the shadow, of disease.  Now, though not the\r\nfirst cause in this instance, it has been indubitably proved,\r\nthat much of the effect, the fever and pain, are produced and\r\ncontinued by the active, omnipresent, sleepless sperm.  Either\r\nkill the micrococcus or heal the wound, and you are free from\r\nboth.  It being, therefore, granted that the ills of life are in\r\nthe air, we have but to find the peculiar nature of the case in\r\nhand, its habits, tastes, and constitution, in order to destroy\r\nit.  Impoverish the soil on which it thrives, before its arrival,\r\nif you can foresee the nature of the inoculation to which you\r\nwill be exposed, by a dilute solution of itself, and supply it\r\nonly with what it particularly dislikes.  For an already\r\nestablished tubercle requiring rapid action of the blood, such as\r\nmay well exist among the birds and vertebrates of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, I suggest a hypodermic rattlesnake injection, while\r\nhydrocyanic acid and tarantula saliva may also come in well.  The\r\ncombinations that so long destroyed us have already become our\r\npanacea."\r\n\r\n"I see you have these poisons at your fingers\' ends," said\r\nAyrault, "and we shall feel the utmost confidence in the remedies\r\nand directions you prescribe."\r\n\r\nThey found that, in addition to their medicine-chest, they would\r\nhave to make room for the following articles, and also many more:\r\nsix shot-guns (three double-barrel 12-bores, three magazine\r\n10-bores,) three rifles, three revolvers; a large supply of\r\nammunition (explosive and solid balls), hunting-knives,\r\nfishing-tackle, compass, sextant, geometrical instruments, canned\r\nfood for forty days, appliance for renewing air, clothing, rubber\r\nboots, apergetic apparatus, protection-wires, aneroid barometer,\r\nand kodaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                            GOOD-BYE.\r\n\r\nAt last the preparations were completed, and it was arranged that\r\nthe Callisto should begin its journey at eleven o\'clock A. M.,\r\nDecember 21st--the northern hemisphere\'s shortest day.\r\n\r\nThough six months\' operations could hardly be expected to have\r\nproduced much change in the inclination of the earth\'s axis, the\r\nautumn held on wonderfully, and December was pronounced very\r\nmild.  Fully a million people were in and about Van Cortlandt\r\nPark hours before the time announced for the start, and those\r\nnear looked inquiringly at the trim little air-ship, that, having\r\ndone well on the trial trip, rested on her longitudinal and\r\ntransverse keels, with a battery of chemicals alongside, to make\r\nsure of a full power supply.\r\n\r\nThe President and his Cabinet--including, of course, the shining\r\nlights of the State and Navy Departments--came from Washington.\r\nThese, together with Mr. and Mrs. Preston, and a number of people\r\nwith passes, occupied seats arranged at the sides of the\r\nplatform; while sightseers and scientists assembled from every\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a ship for you!" said Secretary Stillman to the\r\nSecretary of the Navy.  "She\'ll not have to be dry-docked for\r\nbarnacles, neither will the least breeze make the passengers\r\nsick."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you landlubbers think of," replied Deepwaters.  "I\r\nremember one of the kings over in Europe said to me, as he\r\nintroduced me to the queen:  \'Your Secretary of State is a great\r\nman, but why does he always part his hair in the middle?\'\r\n\r\n"\'So that it shall not turn his head,\' I replied.\r\n\r\n"\'But with so gallant and handsome an officer as you to lean\r\nupon,\' he answered, \'I should think he could look down on all the\r\nworld.\'  Whereupon I asked him what he\'d take to drink."\r\n\r\n"Your apology is accepted," replied Secretary Stillman.\r\n\r\nCortlandt also came from Washington, where, as chief of the\r\nGovernment\'s Expert Examiners Board, he had temporary quarters.\r\nBearwarden sailed over the spectators\' heads in one of the\r\nTerrestrial Axis Straightening Company\'s flying machines, while\r\nAyrault, to avoid the crowd, had come to the Callisto early, and\r\nwas showing the interior arrangements to Sylvia, who had\r\naccompanied him.  She was somewhat piqued because at the last\r\nmoment he had not absolutely insisted on carrying her off, or\r\noffered, if necessary, to displace his presidential and\r\nDoctor-of-Laws friends in order to make room.\r\n\r\n"You will have an ideal trip," she said, looking over some\r\nastronomical star-charts and photographic maps of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn that lay on the table, with a pair of compasses, "and I\r\nhope you won\'t lose your way."\r\n\r\n"I shall need no compass to find my way back," replied Ayrault,\r\n"if I ever succeed in leaving this planet; neither will\r\nstar-charts be necessary, for you will be a magnet stronger than\r\nany compass, and, compared with my star, all others are dim."\r\n\r\n"You should write a book," said Sylvia, "and put some of those\r\nthings in it."  She was wearing a bunch of forget-me-nots and\r\nviolets that she had cut from a small flower-garden of potted\r\nplants Ayrault had sent her, which she had placed in her father\'s\r\nconservatory.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the small chime clock set in the Callisto\'s\r\nwood-work rang out quarter to eleven.  As the sounds died away,\r\nSylvia became very pale, and began to regret in her womanly way\r\nthat she had allowed her hero to attempt this experiment.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said, clinging to his arm, "it was very wrong of me to\r\nlet you begin this.  I was so dazzled by the splendour of your\r\nscheme when I heard it, and so anxious that you should have the\r\nglory of being the first to surpass Columbus, that I did not\r\nrealize the full meaning.  I thought, also, you seemed rather\r\nready to leave me," she added gently, "and so said little; you do\r\nnot know how it almost breaks my heart now that I am about to\r\nlose you.  It was quixotic to let you undertake this journey."\r\n\r\n"An undertaker would have given me his kind offices for one even\r\nlonger, had I remained here," replied Ayrault.  "I cannot live in\r\nthis humdrum world without you.  The most sustained excitement\r\ncannot even palliate what seems to me like unrequited love."\r\n\r\n"O Dick!" she exclaimed, giving him a reproachful glance, "you\r\nmustn\'t say that.  You know you have often told me my reason for\r\nstaying and taking my degree was good.  My lot will be very much\r\nharder than yours, for you will forget me in the excitement of\r\ndiscovery and adventure; but I--what can I do in the midst of all\r\nthe old associations?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, sweetheart," he said, kissing her hand, "I have\r\nseemed on the verge of despair all the time."\r\n\r\nSeeing that their separation must shortly begin, Ayrault tried to\r\nassume a cheerful look; but as Sylvia turned her eyes away they\r\nwere suspiciously moist.\r\n\r\nJust one minute before the starting-time Ayrault took Sylvia back\r\nto her mother, and, after pressing her hand and having one last\r\nlong look into her--or, as he considered them, HIS--deep-sea\r\neyes, he returned to the Callisto, and was standing at the foot\r\nof the telescopic aluminum ladder when his friends arrived.  As\r\nall baggage and impedimenta bad been sent aboard and properly\r\nstowed the day before, the travellers had not to do but climb to\r\nand enter by the second-story window.  It distressed Bearwarden\r\nthat the north pole\'s exact declination on the 21st day of\r\nDecember, when the axis was most inclined, could not be figured\r\nout by the hour at which they were to start, so as to show what\r\nchange, if any, had already been brought about, but the\r\nastronomers were working industriously, and promised that, if it\r\nwere finished by midnight, they would telegraph the result into\r\nspace by flash-light code.\r\n\r\nRaising his hat to his fiancee and his prospective\r\nparents-in-law, Ayrault followed them up.  To draw in and fold\r\nthe ladder was but the work of a moment.  As the clocks in the\r\nneighbouring steeples began to strike eleven, Ayrault touched the\r\nswitch that would correspond to the throttle of an engine, and\r\nthe motors began to work at rapidly increasing speed.  Slowly the\r\nCallisto left her resting-place as a Galatea might her pedestal,\r\nonly, instead of coming down, she rose still higher.\r\n\r\nA large American flag hanging from the window, which, as they\r\nstarted, fluttered as in a southern zephyr, soon began to flap as\r\nin a stiff breeze as the car\'s speed increased.  With a final\r\nwave, at which a battery of twenty-one field-pieces made the air\r\nring with a salute, and the multitude raised a mighty cheer, they\r\ndrew it in and closed the window, sealing it hermetically in\r\norder to keep in the air that, had an opening remained, would\r\nsoon have become rarefied.\r\n\r\nSylvia had waved her handkerchief with the utmost enthusiasm, in\r\nspite of the sadness at her heart.  But she now had other use for\r\nit in trying to hide her tears.  The Callisto was still going\r\nstraight up, with a speed already as great as a cannon ball\'s,\r\nand was almost out of sight.  The multitude then began to\r\ndisperse, and Sylvia returned to her home.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow the Callisto.  The earth and Jupiter not being\r\nexactly in opposition, as they would be if the sun, the earth,\r\nand Jupiter were in line, with the earth between the two, but\r\nrather as shown in the diagram, the Callisto\'s journey was\r\nconsiderably more than 380,000,000 miles, the mean opposition\r\ndistance.  As they wished to start by daylight--i. e., from the\r\nside of the earth turned towards the sun--they could not steer\r\nimmediately for Jupiter, but were obliged to go a few hundred\r\nmiles in the direction of the sun, then change their course to\r\nsomething like a tangent to the earth, and get their final right\r\ndirection in swinging near the moon, since they must be\r\ncomparatively near some material object to bring apergy into\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nThe maximum power being turned on, the projectile shot from the\r\nearth with tremendous and rapidly increasing speed, by the\r\nshortest course--i. e., a straight line--so that for the present\r\nit was not necessary to steer.  Until beyond the limits of the\r\natmosphere they kept the greatest apergetic repulsion focused on\r\nthe upper part of their cylinder, so that its point went first,\r\nand they encountered least possible  resistance.  Looking through\r\nthe floor windows, therefore, the travellers had a most superb\r\nview.  The air being clear, the eastern border of North America\r\nand the Atlantic were outlined as on a map, the blue of the ocean\r\nand brownish colour of the land, with white snow- patches on the\r\nelevations, being very marked.  The Hudson and the Sound appeared\r\nas clearly  defined blue ribbons, and between and around the two\r\nthey could see New York.  They also saw the ocean dotted for\r\nmiles with points in which they recognized the marine spiders and\r\ncruisers of the North Atlantic squadron, and the ships on the\r\nhome station, which they knew were watching them through their\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n"I see," said Cortlandt, "that Deepwaters has been as good as his\r\nword, and has his ships on the watch to rescue us in case we\r\nfail."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Bearwarden, "he is the right sort.  When he gave\r\nthat promise I knew his men would be there."\r\n\r\nThey soon perceived that they had reached the void of space, for,\r\nthough the sun blazed with a splendour they had never before\r\nseen, the firmament was intensely black, and the stars shone as\r\nat midnight.  Here they began to change their course to a curve\r\nbeginning with a spiral, by charging the Callisto apergetically,\r\nand directing the current towards the moon, to act as an aid to\r\nthe lunar attraction, while still allowing the earth to repel,\r\nand their motion gradually became the resultant of the two\r\nforces, the change from a straight line being so gradual,\r\nhowever, that for some minutes they scarcely perceived it.  The\r\ncoronal streamers about the sun, such as are visible on earth\r\nduring a total eclipse, shone with a halo against the\r\nultra-Cimmerian background, bursting forth to a height of twenty\r\nor thirty thousand miles above the surface in vast cyclonic\r\nstorms, producing so rapid a motion that a column of incandescent\r\ngas may move ten thousand miles in less than ten minutes.\r\nWhether these great streaks were in part electrical phenomena\r\nsimilar to the aurora borealis, or entirely of intensely heated\r\nmaterial thrown up by explosions within the sun\'s mass, they\r\ncould not tell even from their point of vantage.\r\n\r\n"I believe," said Cortlandt, pointing to the streamers, "that\r\nthey are masses of gas thrown beyond the sun\'s atmosphere, which\r\nexpand enormously when the pressure to which they are subjected\r\nin the sun is removed--for only in space freed from resistance\r\ncould they move at such velocities, and that their brilliancy is\r\nincreased by great electrical disturbance.  If they were entirely\r\nthe play of electrical forces, their change of place would be\r\npractically instantaneous, which, however rapid their movement,\r\nis not the case."\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                     THE LAST OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nFinding that they were rapidly swinging towards their proper\r\ncourse, and that the earth in its journey about the sun would\r\nmove out of their way, they divided their power between repelling\r\nthe body they had left and increasing the attraction of the moon,\r\nand then set about getting their house in order.\r\n\r\nBearwarden, having the largest appetite, was elected cook, the\r\nothers sagely divining that labour so largely for himself would\r\nbe no trial.  Their small but business- like-looking electric\r\nrange was therefore soon in full blast, with Bearwarden in\r\ncommand.  It had enough current to provide heat for cooking for\r\nfour hundred hours, which was an ample margin, and it had this\r\nadvantage, that, no matter how much it was used, it could not\r\nexhaust the air as any other form of heat would.\r\n\r\nThere were also a number of sixteen-candle-power incandescent\r\nlamps, so that when passing through the shadow of a planet, or at\r\nnight after their arrival on Jupiter, their car would be brightly\r\nilluminated.  They had also a good search-light for examining the\r\ndark side of a satellite, or exploring the spaces in Saturn\'s\r\nrings.  Having lunched sumptuously on canned chicken  soup, beef\r\na la jardiniere, and pheasant that had been sent them by some of\r\ntheir admirers that morning, they put the bones and the glass can\r\nthat had contained the soup into the double-doored partition or\r\nvestibule, placing a large sheet of cardboard to act as a wad\r\nbetween the scraps and the outside door.  By pressing a button\r\nthey unfastened the outside door, and the articles to be disposed\r\nof were shot off by the expansion of the air between the\r\ncardboard disk and the inside door; after which the outside door\r\nwas drawn back to its place by a current sent through a magnet,\r\nbut little power being required to reclose it with no resisting\r\natmospheric pressure.  As the electricity ran along a wire\r\npassing through a hermetically sealed opening in the floor, there\r\nwas no way by which more air than that in the vestibule could\r\nescape; and as the somewhat flat space between the doors\r\ncontained less than one cubic foot, the air- pressure inside the\r\nCallisto could not be materially lessened by a few openings.\r\n\r\n"By filling the vestibule as full as possible," said Bearwarden,\r\n"and so displacing most of its air, we shall be able to open the\r\noutside door oftener without danger of rarefaction."\r\n\r\nThe things they had discharged flew off with considerable speed\r\nand were soon out of sight; but it was not necessary for them to\r\nmove fast, provided they moved at all, for, the resistance being\r\nnil, they would be sure to go beyond the range of vision,\r\nprovided enough time was allowed, even if the Callisto\'s speed\r\nwas not being increased by apergy, in which case articles outside\r\nand not affected would be quickly left behind.\r\n\r\nThe earth, which at first had filled nearly half their sky, was\r\nrapidly growing smaller.  Being almost between themselves and the\r\nsun, it looked like a crescent moon; and when it was only about\r\ntwenty times the size of the moon they calculated they must have\r\ncome nearly two hundred thousand miles.  The moon was now on what\r\na sailor would call the starboard bow--i. e., to the right and\r\nahead.  Being a little more than three quarters full, and only\r\nabout fifty thousand miles off, it presented a splendid sight,\r\nbrilliant as polished silver, and about twenty-five times as\r\nlarge as they had ever before seen it with the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nIt was just ten hours since they had started, and at that moment\r\n9 A. M. in New York; but, though it was night there, the Callisto\r\nwas bathed in a flood of sunlight such as never shines on earth.\r\nThe only night they would have was on the side of the Callisto\r\nturned away from the sun, unless they passed through some shadow,\r\nwhich they intended to avoid on account of the danger of\r\ncolliding with a meteor in the dark.  The moon and the Callisto\r\nwere moving on converging lines, the curve on which they had\r\nentered having swung them to the side nearest the earth; but they\r\nsaw that their own tremendous and increasing speed would carry\r\nthem in front of the moon in its nearly circular orbit.  Wishing\r\nto change the direction of their flight by the moon\'s attraction,\r\nthey shut off the power driving them from the earth, whereupon\r\nthe Callisto turned its heavy base towards the moon.  They were\r\nalready moving at such speed that their momentum alone would\r\ncarry them hundreds of thousands of miles into space, and were\r\nthen almost abreast of the earth\'s satellite, which was but a few\r\nthousand miles away.  The spectacle was magnificent.  As they\r\nlooked at it through their field glasses or with the unaided eye,\r\nthe great cracks and craters showed with the utmost clearness,\r\nsweeping past them almost as the landscape flies past a railway\r\ntrain.  There was something awe-inspiring in the vast antiquity\r\nof that furrowed lunar surface, by far the oldest thing that\r\nmortal eye can see, since, while observing the ceaseless\r\npolitical or geological changes on earth, the face of this dead\r\nsatellite, on account of the absence of air and water and\r\nconsequent erosion, has remained unchanged for bygone ages, as it\r\ndoubtless will for many more.\r\n\r\nThey closely watched the Callisto\'s course.  At first it did not\r\nseem to deflect from a straight line, and they stood ready to\r\nturn on the apergetic force again, when the car very slowly began\r\nto show the effect of the moon\'s near pull; but not till they had\r\nso far passed it that the dark side was towards them were they\r\nheading straight for Jupiter.  Then they again turned on full\r\npower and got a send-off shove on the moon and earth combined,\r\nwhich increased their speed so rapidly that they felt they could\r\nsoon shut off the current altogether and save their supply.\r\n\r\n"We must be ready to watch the signals from the arctic circle,"\r\nsaid Bearwarden.  "At midnight, if the calculations are finished,\r\nthe result will be flashed by the searchlight."  It was then ten\r\nminutes to twelve, and the earth was already over four hundred\r\nthousand miles away.  Focusing their glasses upon the region near\r\nthe north pole, which, being turned from the sun, was towards\r\nthem and in darkness, they waited.\r\n\r\n"In this blaze of sunlight," said Cortlandt, "I am afraid we can\r\nsee nothing."\r\n\r\nFortunately, at this moment the Callisto entered the moon\'s\r\ntapering shadow.\r\n\r\n"This," said Ayrault, "is good luck.  We could of course have\r\ngone into the shadow; but to change our course would have delayed\r\nus, and we might have lost part of the chance of increasing our\r\nspeed."\r\n\r\n"There will be no danger from, meteors or sub-satellites here,"\r\nsaid Bearwarden, "for anything revolving about the moon at this\r\ndistance would be caught by the earth."\r\n\r\nThe sun had apparently set behind the moon, and they were\r\neclipsed.  The stars shone with the utmost splendour against the\r\ndead-black sky, and the earth appeared as a large crescent, still\r\nconsiderably larger than the satellite to which they were\r\naccustomed.  Exactly at midnight a faint phosphorescent light,\r\nlike that of a glow-worm, appeared in the region of Greenland on\r\nthe planet they had left.  It gradually increased its strength\r\ntill it shone like a long white beam projected from a lighthouse,\r\nand in this they beheld the work of the greatest search-light\r\never made by man, receiving for a few moments all the electricity\r\ngenerated by the available dynamos at Niagara and the Bay of\r\nFundy, the steam engines, and other sources of power in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere.  The beam lasted with growing intensity for\r\none minute; it then spelled out with clean-cut intervals,\r\naccording to the Cable Code:  "23@ no\' 6".  The southern\r\nhemisphere pumps are now raising and storing water at full blast.\r\nWe have already begun to lower the Arctic Ocean."\r\n\r\n"Victory!" shouted Bearwarden, in an ecstasy of delight.  "Nearly\r\nhalf a degree in six months, with but one pole working.  If we\r\ncan add at this rate each time to the speed of straightening\r\nalready acquired, we can reverse our engines in five years, and\r\nin five more the earth will be at rest and right."\r\n\r\n"Look!" said Ayrault, "they are sending something else."  The\r\nflashes came in rapid succession, reaching far into space.  With\r\ntheir glasses fixed upon them, they made out these sentences:\r\n"Our telescopes, in whatever part of the earth was turned towards\r\nyou, have followed you since you started, and did not lose sight\r\nof you till you entered the moon\'s shadow.  On your present\r\ncourse you will be in darkness till 12.16, when we shall see you\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nOn receiving this last earthly message, the travellers sprang to\r\ntheir searchlight, and, using its full power, telegraphed back\r\nthe following:  "Many thanks to you for good news about earth,\r\nand to Secretary Deepwaters for lending us the navy.  Result of\r\nwork most glorious.  Remember us to everybody.  Shadow\'s edge\r\napproaching."\r\n\r\nThis was read by the men in the great observatories, who\r\nevidently telephoned to the arctic Signal Light immediately, for\r\nit flashed back:  "Got your message perfectly.  Wish you greatest\r\nluck.  The T. A. S. Co. has decked the Callisto\'s pedestal with\r\nflowers, and has ordered a tablet set up on the site to\r\ncommemorate your celestial journey."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the shadow swept by, and they were in the full\r\nblaze of cloudless day.  The change was so great that for a\r\nmoment they were obliged to close their eyes.  The polished sides\r\nof the Callisto shone so brightly that they knew they were easily\r\nseen.  The power temporarily diverted in sending them the message\r\nthen returned to the work of draining the Arctic Ocean, which, as\r\nthe north pole was now returning to the sun, was the thing to do,\r\nand the travellers resumed their study of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                         SPACE AND MARS.\r\n\r\nNever before had the travellers observed the stars and planets\r\nunder such favourable conditions.  No air or clouds intervened,\r\nand as the Callisto did not revolve on its axis there was no\r\nnecessity for changing the direction of the glasses.  After an\r\nhour of this interesting work, however, as it was already late at\r\nthe longitude they had left on earth, and as they knew they had\r\nmany days in space before them, they prepared to go to bed.  When\r\nready, they had only to pull down the shades; for, as apergy was\r\nnot applied to them, but only to the Callisto, they still looked\r\nupon the floor as down, and closed the heavy curtains to have\r\nnight or darkness.  They found that the side of the Callisto\r\nturned constantly towards the sun was becoming very warm, the\r\ndouble-toughened glass windows making it like a greenhouse; but\r\nthey consoled themselves with the thought that the sun\'s power on\r\nthem was hourly becoming less, and they felt sure the double\r\nwalls and thick upholstery would protect them almost anywhere\r\nwithin the solar system from the intense cold of space.\r\n\r\n"We could easily have arranged," said Ayrault, for night and day\r\non alternate sides of the Callisto by having strips of metal\r\narranged spirally on the outside as on the end of an arrow.\r\nThese would have started us turning as slowly as we like, since\r\nwe passed through the atmosphere at a comparatively low rate of\r\nspeed."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Cortlandt, "the motion, however slow, would\r\nhave made us dizzy.  It would be confusing to see the heavens\r\nturning about us, and it would interfere with using the glasses."\r\n\r\nThe base and one side of the Callisto had constant sunshine,\r\nwhile the other side and the dome were in the blackest night.\r\nThis dome, on account of its shape, sky windows, and the\r\ncompleteness with which it could be isolated, was an ideal\r\nobservatory, and there was seldom a time during their waking\r\nhours for the rest of the journey when it was not occupied by\r\none, two, or all the observers.\r\n\r\n"There is something marvellous," said Cortlandt, "about the\r\ncondition of space.  Its absolute cold is appalling, apparently\r\nbecause there is nothing to absorb heat; yet we find the base of\r\nthis material projectile uncomfortably warm, though, should we\r\nexpose a thermometer in the shade in front, we know it would show\r\na temperature of three hundred to four hundred degrees below\r\nzero--were the instrument capable of recording it."\r\n\r\nArtificial darkness having been obtained, the travellers were\r\nsoon asleep, Bearwarden\'s dreams being regaled with thoughts of\r\nhis company\'s triumph; Ayrault\'s, naturally, with visions of\r\nSylvia; while Cortlandt frequently started up, thinking he had\r\nalready made some great astronomical discovery.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 A. M., according to seventy-fifth meridian time, the\r\nexplorers awoke feeling greatly refreshed.  The tank in which the\r\nliquefied oxygen was kept automatically gave off its gas so\r\nevenly that the air remained normal, while the lime contained in\r\ncups absorbed the carbon dioxide as fast as they exhaled it.\r\nThey had darkened those windows through which the sun was\r\nactually pouring, for, on account of the emptiness of the\r\nsurrounding ether and consequent absence of diffusion of light,\r\nnothing but the inky blackness of space and the bright stars\r\nlooked in at the rest.  On raising the shades they got an idea of\r\ntheir speed.  A small crescent, smaller than the familiar moon,\r\naccompanied by one still tinier, was all that could be seen of\r\nthe earth and its satellite.\r\n\r\n"We must," said Bearwarden, "be moving at the rate of nearly a\r\nmillion miles an hour, from the way we have travelled."\r\n\r\n"We must be doing fully a million," replied Cortlandt, "for by\r\nthis time we are pretty well in motion, having got a tremendous\r\nstart when so near the moon, with it and the earth in line."\r\n\r\nBy steering straight for Jupiter, instead of for the place it\r\nwould occupy ten days later, they knew they would swing past, for\r\nthe giant planet, being in rapid motion, would advance; but they\r\ndid not object to this, since it would give them a chance to\r\nexamine their new world in case they wished to do so before\r\nalighting; while, if they preferred to land at once, they could\r\neasily change their course by means of the moons, the fourth,\r\nfrom which their car was named, being the one that they knew\r\nwould be of most use.  Their tremendous speed showed them they\r\nshould have time for exploration on their arrival, and that they\r\nwould reach their destination sooner than they had expected.  The\r\napergetic force being applied, as we have seen, only to the\r\nCallisto, just as power in starting is exerted on a carriage or\r\nrailway car and only through it to the passengers, Ayrault and\r\nhis companions had no unusual sensation except loss of weight,\r\nfor, when they were so far from the earth, its attraction was\r\nvery slight, and no other planet was near enough to take its\r\nplace.  After breakfast, wishing to reach the dome, and realizing\r\nthat it would be unnecessary to climb, each in turn gave a slight\r\nspring and was obliged to put up his hands to avoid striking the\r\nroof.  In the cool quiet of the dark dome it was difficult to\r\nbelieve that only twenty feet away the sun was shining with such\r\nintensity upon the metal base as to make it too hot on the inside\r\nto touch without gloves.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracted their attention was the size and\r\nbrilliance of Mars.  Although this red planet was over forty\r\nmillion miles from the earth when they started, they calculated\r\nthat it was less than thirty million miles from them now, or five\r\nmillions nearer than it had ever been to them before.  This\r\nreduction in distance, and the clearness of the void through\r\nwhich they saw it, made it a splendid sight, its disk showing\r\nclearly.  From hour to hour its size and brightness increased,\r\ntill towards evening it looked like a small, full moon, the sun\r\nshining squarely upon it.  They calculated that on the course\r\nthey were moving they should pass about nine hundred thousand\r\nmiles to the right or behind it, since it was moving towards\r\ntheir left.  They were interested to see what effect the mass of\r\nMars would have on the Callisto, and saw here a chance of still\r\nfurther increasing their speed.  Notwithstanding its tremendous\r\nrate, they expected to see the Callisto swerve from its straight\r\nline and move towards Mars, whose orbital speed of nine hundred\r\nmiles a minute they thought would take it out of the Callisto\'s\r\nway, so that no actual collision would occur even if their\r\nair-ship were left to her own devices.\r\n\r\nTowards evening they noticed through their glasses that several\r\napparently island peaks in the southern hemisphere, which was\r\nturned towards them, became white, from which they concluded that\r\na snow-storm was in progress.  The south polar region was also\r\nmarkedly glaciated, though the icecap was not as extensive as\r\neither of those at the poles of the earth.\r\n\r\n"As the Martian winters must be fully as severe as ours," said\r\nCortlandt, "on account of their length, the planet\'s distance\r\nfrom the sun, and the twenty-seven and a half degrees inclination\r\nof its axis, we can account for the smallness of its ice-caps\r\nonly by the fact that its oceans cover but one fourth of its\r\nsurface instead of three quarters, as on the earth, and there is\r\nconsequently a smaller evaporation and rain and snow-fall."\r\n\r\nThey were too much interested to think of sleeping that night,\r\nand so, after dining comfortably returned to their observatory.\r\nWhen within four million miles of Mars the Callisto began to\r\nswerve perceptibly, its curve, as when near the moon beginning\r\nwith a spiral.  They swung on unconcernedly, however, knowing\r\nthey could check their approach at any time.  Soon Mars appeared\r\nto have a diameter ten times as great as that of the moon, and\r\npromised shortly to occupy almost one side of their sky.\r\n\r\n"We must be on the lookout for the satellites," said Cortlandt;\r\n"a collision with either would be worse than a wreck on a desert\r\nisland."\r\n\r\nThey therefore turned their glasses in the direction of the\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\n"Until Prof. Hall, at Washington, discovered the two satellites\r\nin 1877," he continued, "Mars was supposed to be without moons.\r\nThe outer one, Deimos, is but six miles in diameter, and revolves\r\nabout its primary in thirty hours and eighteen minutes, at a\r\ndistance of fourteen thousand six hundred miles.  As it takes but\r\nlittle longer to complete a revolution than Mars does to rotate\r\non its axis, it remains in the Martial sky one hundred and\r\nthirty-two hours between rising and setting, passing through all\r\nthe phases from new moon to full and back again four times; that\r\nis, it swings four times around Mars before going below the\r\nhorizon.  It is one of the smallest bodies discovered with a\r\ntelescope.  The inner one, Phobos, is considerably larger, having\r\na diameter of about twenty miles.  It is but twenty-seven hundred\r\nmiles from Mars\'s surface, and completes its revolution in seven\r\nhours and thirty-eight minutes, which is shorter than any other\r\nknown period, Jupiter\'s nearest moon being the next, with eleven\r\nhours and fifty- nine minutes.  It thus revolves in less than a\r\nthird of the time Mars takes to rotate, and must consequently\r\nrise in the west and set in the east, as it is continually\r\nrunning ahead of the surface of the planet, though the sun and\r\nall the other stars rise and set on Mars in the same way as on\r\nthe earth."\r\n\r\nWhen about fifteen thousand miles from Mars, they sighted Deimos\r\ndirectly ahead, and saw that they should pass on its left--i. e.,\r\nbehind--for it was moving across them.  The sun poured directly\r\nupon it, making it appear full and showing all its features.\r\nThere were small unevennesses on the surface, apparently seventy\r\nor a hundred feet high, which were the nearest approach to\r\nmountains, and they ran in ridges or chains.  There were also\r\nunmistakable signs of volcanic action, the craters being large\r\ncompared with the size of the planet, but shallow.  They saw no\r\nsigns of water, and the blackness of the shadows convinced them\r\nthere was no air.  They secured two instantaneous photographs of\r\nthe little satellite as the Callisto swept by, and resumed their\r\ninspection of Mars.  They noticed red and brownish patches on the\r\npeaks that had that morning turned white, from which they\r\nconcluded that the show had begun to melt under the warm spring\r\nsun.  This strengthened the belief they had already formed, that\r\non account of its twenty-seven and a half degrees inclination the\r\nchanges in temperature on Mars must be great and sudden.  So\r\ninterested were they with this, that they did not at first see a\r\nlarge and bright body moving rapidly on a course that converged\r\nwith theirs.\r\n\r\n"We must be ready to repel boarders," said Bearwarden, observing\r\nit for the first time and fixing his glass upon it.  "That must\r\nbe Phobos."\r\n\r\nNot ten miles off they beheld Mars\'s inner moon, and though their\r\nown speed caused them to overtake and rush by it like a\r\nwhirlwind, the satellite\'s rapid motion in its orbit, in a course\r\ntemporarily almost parallel with theirs, served to give them a\r\nchance the better to examine it.  Here the mountain ranges were\r\nconsiderably more conspicuous than on Deimos, and there were\r\nboulders and loose stones upon their slopes, which looked as if\r\nthere might at some time have been frost and water on its\r\nsurface; but it was all dry now, neither was there any air.  The\r\nevidences of volcanic action were also plainly visible, while a\r\nnoticeable flattening at the poles showed that the little body\r\nhad once rotated rapidly on its axis, though whether it did so\r\nstill they had not time to ascertain.  When abreast of it they\r\nwere less than two miles distant, and they secured several\r\ninstantaneous impressions, which they put aside to develop later.\r\nAs the radius of Phobos\'s circle was far shorter than that of the\r\nparabolic curve they were making, it began to draw away, and was\r\nrapidly left behind.  Applying the full apergetic force to Mars\r\nand the larger moon, they shot away like an arrow, having had\r\ntheir speed increased by the planet\'s attraction while\r\napproaching it, and subsequently by repulsion.\r\n\r\n"Either of those," said Bearwarden, looking back at the little\r\nsatellites, "would be a nice yacht for a man to explore space on.\r\nHe would also, of course, need a sun to warm him, if he wished to\r\ngo beyond this system, but that would not have to be a large\r\naffair--in fact, it might be smaller than the planet, and could\r\nrevolve about it like a moon."\r\n\r\n"Though a sun of that size," replied Cortlandt, "might retain its\r\nheat for the time you wished to use it, the planet part would be\r\nnothing like as comfortable as what we have here, for it would be\r\nvery difficult to get enough air-pressure to breathe on so small\r\na body, since, with its slight gravitation-pull, to secure\r\nfifteen pounds to the square inch, or anything like it, the\r\natmosphere would have to extend thousands of miles into space, so\r\nthat on a cloudy day you would be in darkness.  It would be\r\nbetter, therefore, to have such a sun as you describe and\r\naccompany it in a yacht or private car like this, well stocked\r\nwith oxygen and provisions.  When passing through meteoric swarms\r\nor masses of solid matter, collision with which is the most\r\nserious risk we run, the car could follow behind its sun instead\r\nof revolving around it, and be kept from falling into it by\r\npartially reversing the attraction.  As the gravitation of so\r\nsmall a sun would be slight, counteracting it for even a\r\nconsiderable time would take but little from the batteries."\r\n\r\n"There are known to be several unclaimed masses," added Ayrault,\r\n"with diameters of a few hundred yards, revolving about the earth\r\ninside the orbit of the moon.  If in some way two of these could\r\nbe brought into sufficiently violent collision, they would become\r\nluminous and answer very well; the increase in bulk as a result\r\nof the consolidation, and the subsequent heat, about serving to\r\nbring them to the required size.  Whenever this sun showed spots\r\nand indications of cooling, it could be made to collide with the\r\nsolid head of some comet, or small asteroid, till its temperature\r\nwas again right; while if, as a result of these accretions, it\r\nbecame unwieldy, it could be caused to rotate with sufficient\r\nrapidity on its axis to split, and we should have two suns\r\ninstead of one."\r\n\r\n"Bravo!" said Bearwarden.  "There is no limit to what can be\r\ndone.  The idea of our present trip would have seemed more\r\nchimerical to people a hundred years ago than this new scheme\r\nappears now."\r\n\r\nThus they sat and talked, or studied maps and star- charts, or\r\nthe stars themselves, while the hours quickly passed and they\r\nshot through space.  They had now a straight stretch of over\r\nthree hundred million miles, and had to cross the orbits of\r\ninnumerable asteroids on the way.  The apparent size of the sun\r\nhad by this time considerably decreased, and the interior of the\r\nCallisto was no longer uncomfortably warm.  They divided the day\r\ninto twenty-four hours from force of habit, and drew the shades\r\ntightly during what they considered night, while Bearwarden\r\ndistinguished himself as a cook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        HEAVENLY BODIES.\r\n\r\nThe following day, while in their observatory, they saw something\r\nnot many miles ahead.  They watched it for hours, and in fact all\r\nday, but notwithstanding their tremendous speed they came but\r\nlittle nearer.\r\n\r\n"They say a stern chase is a long one," said Bearwarden; but that\r\nbeats anything I have ever seen."\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, they found they WERE nearer, the time\r\ntaken having been in part due to the deceptive distance, which\r\nwas greater than they supposed.\r\n\r\n"A comet!" exclaimed Cortlandt excitedly.  "We shall really be\r\nable to examine it near."\r\n\r\n"It\'s going in our direction," said Ayrault, "and at almost\r\nexactly our speed."\r\n\r\nWhile the sun shone full upon it they brought their camera into\r\nplay, and again succeeded in photographing a heavenly body at\r\nclose range.  The nucleus or head was of course turned towards\r\nthe sun; while the tail, which they could see faintly, preceded\r\nit, as the comet was receding towards the cold and dark depths of\r\nspace.  The head was only a few miles in diameter, for it was a\r\nsmall comet, and was composed of grains and masses of stone and\r\nmeteoric iron.  Many of the grains were no larger than peas or\r\nmustard-seeds; no mass was more than four feet in diameter, and\r\nall of them had very irregular shapes.  The space between the\r\nparticles was never less than one hundred times their masses.\r\n\r\n"We can move about within it," said Ayrault, as the Callisto\r\nentered the aggregation of particles, and moved slowly forward\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe windows in the dome, being made of toughened glass, set\r\nsomewhat slantingly so as to deflect anything touching them, and\r\nhaving, moreover, the pressure of the inside air to sustain them,\r\nwere fairly safe, while the windows in the sides and base were\r\nbut little exposed.  Whenever a large mass seemed dangerously\r\nnear the glass, they applied an apergetic shock to it and sent it\r\nkiting among its fellows.  At these times the Callisto recoiled\r\nslightly also, the resulting motion in either being in inverse\r\nratio to its weight.  There was constant and incessant movement\r\namong the individual fragments, but it was not rotary.  Nothing\r\nseemed to be revolving about anything else; all were moving,\r\napparently swinging back and forth, but no collisions took place.\r\nWhen the separate particles got more than a certain distance\r\napart they reapproached one another, but when seemingly within\r\nabout one hundred diameters of each other they swung off in some\r\nother direction.  The motion was like that of innumerable\r\nharp-strings, which may approach but never strike one another.\r\nAfter a time the Callisto seemed to become endowed with the same\r\nproperty that the fragments possessed; for it and they repelled\r\none another, on a near approach, after which nothing came very\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nMuch of the material was like slag from a furnace, having\r\nevidently been partly fused.  Whether this heat was the result of\r\ncollision or of its near approach to the sun at perihelion, they\r\ncould not tell, though the latter explanation seemed most simple\r\nand probable.  When at about the centre of the nucleus they were\r\nin semi-darkness--not twilight, for any ray that succeeded in\r\npenetrating was dazzlingly brilliant, and the shadows, their own\r\nincluded, were inky black.  As they approached the farther side\r\nand the sunlight decreased, they found that a diffused luminosity\r\npervaded everything.  It was sufficiently bright to enable them\r\nto see the dark side of the meteoric masses, and, on emerging\r\nfrom the nucleus in total darkness, they found the shadow\r\nstretching thousands of miles before them into space.\r\n\r\n"I now understand," said Bearwarden, "why stars of the sixth and\r\nseventh magnitude can be seen through thousands of miles of a\r\ncomet\'s tail.  It is simply because there is nothing in it.  The\r\nreason ANY stars are obscured is because the light in the tail,\r\nhowever faint, is brighter than they, and that light is all that\r\nthe caudal appendage consists of, though what produces it I\r\nconfess I am unable to explain.  I also see why the tail always\r\nstretches away from the sun, because near by it is overwhelmed by\r\nthe more powerful light; in fact, I suspect it is principally in\r\nthe comet\'s shadow that the tail is visible.  It is strange that\r\nno one ever thought of that before, or that any one feared the\r\nearth\'s passing through the tail of a comet.  It is obvious to me\r\nnow that if there were any material substance, any gas, however\r\nrarefied, in this hairlike[1] accompaniment, it would immediately\r\nfall to the comparatively heavy head,\r\nand surround that as a centre."\r\n\r\n[1]  Comet means literally a hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How, then," asked Cortlandt, "do you account for the spaces\r\nbetween those stones?  However slight gravitation might be\r\nbetween some of the grains, if it existed at all, or was\r\nunopposed by some other force, with sufficient time--and they\r\nhave eternity--every comet would come together like a planet into\r\none solid mass.  Perhaps some similar force maintains gases in\r\nthe distended tail, though I know of no such, or even any\r\nanalogous manifestation on earth.  If the law on which we have\r\nbeen brought up, that \'every atom in the universe attracts every\r\nother atom,\' were without exceptions or modifications, that comet\r\ncould not continue to exist in its present form.  Until we get\r\nsome additional illustration, however, we shall be short of data\r\nwith which to formulate any iconoclastic hypothesis.  The source\r\nof the light, I must admit, also puzzles me greatly.  There is\r\ncertainly no heat to which we can attribute it."\r\n\r\nHaving gone beyond the fragments, they applied a strong repulsion\r\ncharge to the comet, creating thereby a perfect whirlpool among\r\nits particles, and quickly left it.  Half an hour later they\r\nagain shut off the current, as the Callisto\'s speed was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nFor some time they had been in the belt of asteroids, but as yet\r\nthey had seen none near.  The morning following their experience\r\nwith the comet, however, they went to their observatory after\r\nbreakfast as usual, and, on pointing their glasses forward,\r\nespied a comparatively large body before them, a little to their\r\nright.\r\n\r\n"That must be Pallas," said Cortlandt, scrutinizing it closely.\r\n"It was discovered by Olbers, in 1802, and was the second\r\nasteroid found, Ceres having been the first, in 1801.  It has a\r\ndiameter of about three hundred miles, being one of the largest\r\nof these small planets.  The most wonderful thing about it is the\r\ninclination of its orbit--thirty-five degrees--to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic; which means that at each revolution in its orbit,\r\nit swings that much above and below the imaginary plane cutting\r\nthe sun at its equator, from which the earth and other larger\r\nplanets vary but little.  This no doubt is due to the near\r\napproach and disturbing attraction of some large comet, or else\r\nit was flung above or below the ordinary plane in the catastrophe\r\nthat we think befell the large planet that doubtless formerly\r\nexisted where we now find this swarm.  You can see that its path\r\nmakes a considerable angle to the plane of the ecliptic, and that\r\nit is now about crossing the line."\r\n\r\nIt soon presented the phase of a half moon, but the waviness of\r\nthe straight line, as in the case of Venus and Mercury, showed\r\nthat the size of the mountains must be tremendous compared with\r\nthe mass of the body, some of them being obviously fifteen miles\r\nhigh.  The intense blackness of the shadows, as on the moon,\r\nconvinced them there was no trace of atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"There being no air," said Cortlandt, "it is safe to assume there\r\nis no water, which helps to account for the great inequalities on\r\nthe body\'s surface, since the mountains will seem higher when\r\nsurrounded by dry ocean- bottom than they would if water came\r\nhalfway up their sides.  Undoubtedly, however, the main cause of\r\ntheir height is the slight effect of gravitation on an asteroid,\r\nand the fact that the shrinking of the interior, and consequent\r\nfolding of the crust in ridges, may have continued for a time\r\nafter there was no longer water on the surface to cut them down.\r\n\r\n"The temperature and condition of a body," continued Cortlandt,\r\n"seem to depend entirely on its size.  In the sun we have an\r\nincandescent, gaseous star, though its spots and the colour of\r\nits rays show that it is becoming aged, or, to be more accurate,\r\nadvanced in its evolutionary development.  Then comes a great\r\njump, for Jupiter has but about one fourteen-hundredth of the\r\nmass of the sun, and we expect to find on it a firm crust, and\r\nthat the planet itself is at about the fourth or fifth  period of\r\ndevelopment, described by Moses as days.  Saturn is doubtless\r\nsomewhat more advanced.  The earth we know has been habitable\r\nmany hundreds of thousands or millions of years, though three\r\nfourths of its surface is still covered by water.  In Mars we see\r\na further step, three fourths of its surface being land.  In\r\nMercury, could we study it better, or in the larger satellites of\r\nJupiter or Saturn, we might find a stepping-stone from Mars to\r\nthe moon, perhaps with no water, but still having air, and being\r\nhabitable in all other respects.  In our own satellite we see a\r\nworld that has died, though its death from an astronomical point\r\nof view is comparatively recent, while this little Pallas has\r\nbeen dead longer, being probably chilled through and through.\r\nFrom this I conclude that all bodies in the solar system had one\r\ngenesis, and were part of the same nebulous mass.  But this does\r\nnot include the other systems and nebulae; for, compared with\r\nthem, our sun, as we have seen, is itself advanced and small\r\nbeside such stars as Sirius having diameters of twelve million\r\nmiles."\r\n\r\nAs they left Pallas between themselves and the sun, it became a\r\ncrescent and finally disappeared.\r\n\r\nTwo days later they sighted another asteroid exactly ahead.  They\r\nexamined it closely, and concluded it must be Hilda, put down in\r\nthe astronomies as No. 153, and having almost the greatest mean\r\ndistance of any of these small bodies from the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen they were so near that the disk was plainly visible to the\r\nunaided eye, Hilda passed between them and Jupiter, eclipsing it.\r\nTo their surprise, the light was not instantly shut off, as when\r\nthe moon occults a star, but there was evident refraction.\r\n\r\n"By George!" said Bearwarden, "here is an asteroid that HAS an\r\natmosphere."\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking it.  They soon discovered a small ice-cap\r\nat one pole, and then made out oceans and continents, with\r\nmountains, forests, rivers, and green fields.  The sight lasted\r\nbut a few moments before they swept by, but they secured several\r\nphotographs, and carried a vivid impression in their minds.\r\nHilda appeared to be about two hundred miles in diameter.\r\n\r\n"How do you account for that living world," Bearwarden asked\r\nCortlandt, "on your theory of size and longevity?"\r\n\r\n"There are two explanations," replied Cortlandt, "if the theory,\r\nas I still believe, is correct.  Hilda has either been brought to\r\nthis system from some other less matured, in the train of a\r\ncomet, and been captured by the immense power of "Jupiter, which\r\nmight account for the eccentricity of its orbit, or some accident\r\nhas happened to rejuvenate it here.  A collision with another\r\nminor planet moving in an orbit that crossed its own, or with the\r\nhead of a large comet, would have reconverted it into a star,\r\nperhaps after it had long been cold.  A comet may first have so\r\nchanged the course of one of two small bodies as to make them\r\ncollide.  This seems to me the most plausible theory.  Over a\r\nhundred years ago the English astronomer, Chambers, wrote of\r\nhaving found traces of atmosphere in some of these minor planets,\r\nbut it was generally thought he was mistaken.  One reason we know\r\nso little about this great swarm of minor planets is, that till\r\nrecently none of them showed a disk to the telescope.  Inasmuch\r\nas only their light was visible, they were indistinguishable from\r\nstars, except by their slow motion.  A hundred years ago only\r\nthree hundred and fifty had been discovered; our photographic\r\nstar-charts have since then shown the number recorded to exceed\r\none thousand."\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                      PREPARING TO ALIGHT.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Ayrault brought out some statistical tables he had\r\ncompiled from a great number of books, and also a diagram of the\r\ncomparative sizes of the planets.  "I have been not a little\r\npuzzled at the discrepancies between even the best authors," he\r\nsaid, "scarcely any two being exactly alike, while every decade\r\nhas seen accepted theories radically changed."  Saying which, he\r\nspread out the result of his labours (shown on the following\r\npages), which the three friends then studied.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(1) Mean distance from sun in millions of miles\r\n(2) Semimajor axis of orbit, earth\'s distance as 1\r\n(3) Eccentricity of orbit\r\n(4) Planets inclination of orbit to elliptic\r\n(5) Light at perihelion\r\n(6) Light at apehelion\r\n(7) Heat, earth as 1\r\n\r\n            (1)     (2)     (3)     (4)      (5)       (6)    (7)\r\n\r\nMercury... 36.0   0.387  0.2056    7@0\'8"   10.58     4.59   6.67\r\n\r\nVenus..... 67.2   0.723  0.0068  3@23\'35"    1.94     1.91   1.91\r\n\r\nThe Earth. 92.9   1.000   0.068    0@0\'0"    1.03    0.997   1.00\r\n\r\nMars......141.5   1.524  0.0933   1@51\'2"    0.52    0.360   1.43\r\n\r\nAsteroids 204.4 to  2.200 0.4 to   5@-35@  325.2  to 3.500   0.34\r\n\r\nJupiter.. 483.3   5.203  0.0483  1@18\'41"    0.04    0.034  0.037\r\n\r\nSaturn... 886.0   9.539  0.0561  2@29\'40"   0.012   0.0099  0.011\r\n\r\nUranus.. 1781.9  19.183  0.0463  0@46\'20"  0.0027   0.0025  0.003\r\n\r\nNeptune. 2791.6  30.055  0.0090   1@47\'2"  0.0011   0.0011  0.001\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(1) MOVEMENT IN ORBIT.

Nature will adapt herself to this change, as\r\nto all others, very readily.  Although the reclamation of the\r\nvast areas of the North American Arctic Archipelago, Alaska,\r\nSiberia, and Antarctic Wilkes Land, from the death-grip of the\r\nice in which they have been held will relieve the pressure of\r\npopulation for another century, at the end of that time it will\r\nsurely be felt again; it is therefore a consolation to feel that\r\nthe mighty planets Jupiter and Saturn, which we are coming to\r\nlook upon as our heritage, will not crush the life out of any\r\nhuman beings by their own weight that may alight upon them."\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed that evening they decided to be up early the\r\nnext day, to study Jupiter, which was already a brilliant object.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, on awakening, they went at once to their\r\nobservatory, and found that Jupiter\'s disk was plainly visible to\r\nthe naked eye, and before night it seemed as large as the full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThey then prepared to check the Callisto\'s headlong speed, which\r\nJupiter\'s attraction was beginning to increase.  When about two\r\nmillion miles from the great planet, which was considerably on\r\ntheir left, they espied Callisto ahead and slightly on their\r\nright, as Deepwaters had calculated it would be.  Applying a mild\r\nrepulsion to this--which was itself quite a world, with its\r\ndiameter of over three thousand miles, though evidently as cold\r\nand dead as the earth\'s old moon--they retarded their forward\r\nrush, knowing that the resulting motion towards Jupiter would be\r\nhelped by the giant\'s pull.  Wishing to be in good condition for\r\ntheir landing, they divided the remainder of the night into\r\nwatches, two going to sleep at a time, the man on duty standing\r\nby to control the course and to get photographic negatives, on\r\nwhich, when they were developed, they found two crescent-shaped\r\ncontinents, a speckled region, and a number of islands.  By 7 A.\r\nM., according to Eastern standard time, they were but fifty\r\nthousand miles from Jupiter\'s surface, the gigantic globe filling\r\nnearly one side of the sky.  In preparation for a sally, they got\r\ntheir guns and accoutrements ready, and then gave a parting\r\nglance at the car.  Their charge of electricity for developing\r\nthe repulsion seemed scarcely touched, and they had still an\r\nabundant supply of oxygen and provisions.  The barometer\r\nregistered twenty-nine inches, showing that they had not lost\r\nmuch air in the numerous openings of the vestibule.  The pressure\r\nwas about what would be found at an altitude of a few hundred\r\nfeet, part of the rarefaction being no doubt due to the fact that\r\nthey did not close the windows until at a considerable height\r\nabove Van Cortlandt Park.\r\n\r\nThey saw they should alight in a longitude on which the sun had\r\njust risen, the rocky tops of the great mountains shining like\r\nhelmets in its rays.  Soon they felt a sharp checking of their\r\nforward motion, and saw, from the changed appearance of the stars\r\nand the sun, that they had entered the atmosphere of their new\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nNot even did Columbus, standing at the prow of the Santa Maria,\r\nwith the New World before him, feel the exultation and delight\r\nexperienced by these latter-day explorers of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.  Their first adventures on landing the reader already\r\nknows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                   EXPLORATION AND EXCITEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke, the flowers were singing with the volume of a\r\ncathedral organ, the chant rising from all around them, and the\r\nsun was already above the horizon.  Finding a deep natural\r\nspring, in which the water was at about blood-heat, they prepared\r\nfor breakfast by taking a bath, and then found they had brought\r\nnothing to eat.\r\n\r\n"It was stupid of us not to think of it," said Bearwarden, "yet\r\nit will be too much out of our way to return to the Callisto."\r\n\r\n"We have two rifles and a gun," said Ayrault, "and have also\r\nplenty of water, and wood for a fire.  All we need is game."\r\n\r\n"The old excuse, that it has been already shot out, cannot hold\r\nhere," said Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"Seeing that we have neither wings nor pneumatic legs, and not\r\nknowing the advantage given us by our rifles," added Bearwarden,\r\n"it should not be shy either.  So far," he continued, "we have\r\nseen nothing edible, though just now we should not be too\r\nparticular; but near a spring like this that kind must exist."\r\n\r\n"The question is," said the professor, "whether the game like\r\nwarm water.  If we can follow this stream till it has been on the\r\nsurface for some time, or till it spreads out, we shall doubtless\r\nfind a huntsman\'s paradise."\r\n\r\n"A bright idea," said Bearwarden.  "Let\'s have our guns ready,\r\nand, as old Deepwaters would say, keep our weather eye open."\r\n\r\nThe stream flowed off in a southeasterly direction, so that by\r\nfollowing it they went towards the volcanoes.\r\n\r\n"It is hard to realize," said the professor, "that those\r\nmountains must be several hundred miles away, for the reason that\r\nthey are almost entirely above the horizon.  This apparent\r\nflatness and wide range of vision is of course the result of\r\nJupiter\'s vast size.  With sufficiently keen sight, or aided by a\r\ngood glass, there is no reason why one should not see at least\r\nfive hundred miles, with but a slight elevation."\r\n\r\n"It is surprising," said Ayrault, "that in what is evidently\r\nJupiter\'s Carboniferous period the atmosphere should be so clear.\r\nOur idea has been that at that time on earth the air was heavy\r\nand dense."\r\n\r\n"So it was, and doubtless is here," replied Cortlandt; "but you\r\nmust remember that both those qualities would be given it by\r\ncarbonic-acid gas, which is entirely invisible and transparent.\r\nNo gas that would be likely to remain in the air would interfere\r\nwith sight; water vapour is the only thing that could; and though\r\nthe crust of this planet, even near the surface, is still hot,\r\nthe sun being so distant, the vapour would not be, raised much.\r\nBy avoiding low places near hot springs, we shall doubtless have\r\nvery nearly as clear an atmosphere as on earth.  What does\r\nsurprise me is the ease with which we breathe.  I can account for\r\nit only by supposing that, the Carboniferous period being already\r\nwell advanced, most of the carbonic acid is already locked up in\r\nthe forests or in Jupiter\'s coal-beds."\r\n\r\n"How, asked Bearwarden, "do you account for the \'great red spot\'\r\nthat appeared here in 1878, lasted several years, and then\r\ngradually faded?  It was taken as unmistakable evidence that\r\nJupiter\'s atmosphere was filled with impenetrable banks of cloud.\r\nIn fact, you remember many of the old books said we had probably\r\nnever seen the surface."\r\n\r\n"That has puzzled me very much," replied Cortlandt, "but I never\r\nbelieved the explanation then given was correct.  The\r\nCarboniferous period is essentially one of  great forest growth;\r\nso there would be nothing out of the way in supposing the spot,\r\nnotwithstanding its length of twenty-seven thousand miles and its\r\nbreadth of eight thousand miles, to have been forest.  It\r\noccurred in what would correspond to the temperate region on\r\nearth.  Now, though the axis of this planet is practically\r\nstraight, the winds of course change their direction, and so the\r\ntemperature does vary from day to day.  What is more probable\r\nthan that, owing perhaps to a prolonged norther or cold spell, a\r\nlong strip of forest lying near the frost line was brought a few\r\ndegrees below it, so that the leaves changed their colours as\r\nthey do on earth?  It would, it seems to me, be enough to give\r\nthe surface a distinct colour; and the fact that the spot\'s\r\ngreatest length was east and west, or along the lines of\r\nlatitude, so that the whole of that region might have been\r\nexposed to the same conditions of temperature, strengthens this\r\nhypothesis.  The strongest objection is, that the spot is said to\r\nhave moved; but the motion--five seconds--was so slight that it\r\nmight easily have been an error in observation, or the first area\r\naffected by the cold may have been enlarged on one side.  It\r\nseems to me that the stability the spot DID have would make the\r\ncloud theory impossible on earth, and much more so here, with the\r\nfar more rapid rotation and more violent winds.  It may also have\r\nbeen a cloud of smoke from a volcano in eruption, such as we saw\r\non our arrival, though it is doubtful whether in that case it\r\nwould have remained nearly stationary while going through its\r\ngreatest intensity and fading, which would look as though the\r\nturned leaves had fallen off and been gradually replaced by new\r\nones; and, in addition to this, the spot since it was first\r\nnoticed has never entirely disappeared, which might mean a\r\nvolcanic region constantly emitting smoke, or that the surface,\r\ndoubtless from some covering whose colour can change, is normally\r\nof a different shade from the surrounding region.  In any case,\r\nwe have as yet seen nothing that would indicate a permanently\r\nclouded atmosphere."\r\n\r\nThough they had walked a considerable distance, the water was not\r\nmuch cooled; and though the stream\'s descent was so slight that\r\non earth its current would have been very slow, here it rushed\r\nalong like a mountain torrent, the reason, of course, being that\r\na given amount of water on Jupiter would depress a spring balance\r\n2.55 times as much as on the earth.\r\n\r\n"It is strange," said Ayrault, "that, notwithstanding its great\r\nspeed, the water remains so hot; you would think its motion would\r\ncool it."\r\n\r\n"So it does," answered the professor.  "It of course cools\r\nconsiderably more in a given period--as, for instance, one\r\nminute--than if it were moving more slowly, but on account of its\r\nspeed it has been exposed to the air but a very short time since\r\nleaving the spring."\r\n\r\nJust before them the stream now widened into a narrow lake, which\r\nthey could see was straight for some distance.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said Bearwarden, "this water seems in such haste\r\nto reach the ocean that it turns neither to right nor to left,\r\nand does not even seem to wish to widen out."\r\n\r\nAs the huge ferns and palms grew to the water\'s edge, they\r\nconcluded the best way to traverse the lake would be on a raft.\r\nAccordingly, choosing a large overhanging palm, Bearwarden and\r\nAyrault fired each an explosive ball into its trunk, about\r\neighteen inches from the ground.  One round was enough to put it\r\nin the water, each explosion removing several cubic feet of wood.\r\nBy repeating this process on other trees they soon had enough\r\nlarge timber for buoyancy, so that they had but to superimpose\r\nlighter cross-logs and bind the whole together with pliable\r\nbranches and creepers to form a substantial raft.  The doctor\r\nclimbed on, after which Bearwarden and Ayrault cast off, having\r\nprepared long poles for navigating.  With a little care they kept\r\ntheir bark from catching on projecting roots, and as the stream\r\ncontinued to widen till it was about one hundred yards across,\r\ntheir work became easy.  Carried along at a speed of two or three\r\nmiles an hour, they now saw that the water and the banks they\r\npassed were literally alive with reptiles and all sorts of\r\namphibious creatures, while winged lizards sailed from every\r\noverhanging branch into the water as they approached.  They\r\nnoticed also many birds similar to storks and cranes, about the\r\nsize of ostriches, standing on logs in the water, whose bills\r\nwere provided with teeth.\r\n\r\n"We might almost think we were on earth," said Ayrault, "from the\r\nlooks of those storks standing on one leg, with the other drawn\r\nup, were it not for their size."\r\n\r\n"How do you suppose they defend themselves," asked Bearwarden,\r\n"from the snakes with which the water is filled?"\r\n\r\n"I suspect they can give a pretty good account of themselves,"\r\nreplied Cortlandt, "with those teeth.  Besides, with only one leg\r\nexposed, there is but a very small object for a snake to strike\r\nat.  For their number and size, I should say their struggle for\r\nexistence was comparatively mild.  Doubtless non-poisonous, or,\r\nfor that matter, poisonous snakes, form a great part of their\r\ndiet."\r\n\r\nOn passing the bend in the lake they noticed that the banks were\r\nslightly higher, while palms, pine-trees, and rubber plants\r\nsucceeded the ferns.  In the distance they now heard a tremendous\r\ncrashing, which grew louder as the seconds passed.  It finally\r\nsounded like an earthquake.  Involuntarily they held their breath\r\nand grasped their weapons.  Finally, at some distance in the\r\nwoods they saw a dark mass moving rapidly and approaching the\r\nriver obliquely.  Palms and pine-trees went down before it like\r\nstraws, while its head was continually among the upper branches.\r\nAs the monster neared the lake, the water at the edges quivered,\r\nshowing how its weight shook the banks at each stride, while\r\nstumps and tree-trunks on which it stepped were pressed out of\r\nsight in the ground.  A general exodus of the other inhabitants\r\nfrom his line of march began; the moccasins slid into the water\r\nwith a low splash, while the boa-constrictors and the tree-snakes\r\nmoved off along the ground when they felt it tremble, and a\r\nnumber of night birds retreated into the denser woods with loud\r\ncries at being so rudely disturbed.  The huge beast did not stop\r\ntill he reached the bank, where lie switched his tail, raised his\r\nproboscis, and sniffed the air uneasily, his height being fully\r\nthirty feet and his length about fifty.  On seeing the raft and\r\nits occupants, he looked at them stupidly and threw back his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"He seems to be turning up his nose at us," said Bearwarden.\r\n"All the same, he will do well for breakfast."\r\n\r\nAs the creature moved, his chest struck a huge overhanging palm,\r\ntearing it off as though it had been a reed.  Brushing it aside\r\nwith his trunk, he was about to continue his march, when two\r\nrifle reports rang out together, rousing the echoes and a number\r\nof birds that screeched loudly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                 MASTODON AND WILL-O\'-THE WISPS.\r\n\r\nBearwarden\'s bullet struck the mammoth in the shoulder, while\r\nAyrault\'s aim was farther back.  As the balls exploded, a\r\nhalf-barrelful of flesh and hide was shot from each, leaving two\r\ngaping holes.  Instantly he rushed among the trees, making his\r\ncourse known for some time by his roars.  As he turned,\r\nBearwarden fired again, but the hall flew over him, blowing off\r\nthe top of a tree.\r\n\r\n"Now for the chase!" said Ayrault.  "There would be no excuse for\r\nlosing him."\r\n\r\nQuickly pushing their raft to shore and securing it to the bank,\r\nthe three jumped off.  Thanks to their rubber boots and galvanic\r\noutfits which automatically kept them charged, they were as spry\r\nas they would have been on earth.  The ground all about them, and\r\nin a strip twelve feet wide where the mammoth had gone, was torn\r\nup, and the vegetation trodden down.  Following this trail, they\r\nstruck back into the woods, where in places the gloom cast by the\r\nthick foliage was so dense that there was a mere twilight,\r\nstartling as they went numbers of birds of grey and sombre\r\nplumage, whose necks and heads, and the sounds they uttered, were\r\nso reptilian that the three terrestrials believed they must also\r\npossess poison fangs.\r\n\r\n"The most highly developed things we have seen here," said\r\nBearwarden, "are the flowers and fireflies, most of the birds and\r\namphibians being simply loathsome."\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded they found tracks of blood, which were rapidly\r\nattracting swarms of the reptile birds and snakes, which,\r\nhowever, as a rule, fled at their approach.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what can have caused that mammoth to move so fast, and\r\nto have seemed so ill at ease?" said the doctor.  "His motive\r\ncertainly was not thirst, for he did not approach the water in a\r\ndirect line, neither did he drink on reaching it.  One would\r\nthink nothing short of an earthquake or a land-slide could\r\ntrouble him."\r\n\r\n"There can be no land-slide here," said Ayrault, for the country\r\nis too flat."\r\n\r\n"And after yesterday\'s eruptions," added Bearwarden, "it would\r\nseem as though the volcanoes could have scarcely enough steam\r\nleft to make trouble."\r\n\r\nThe blood-tracks, continuing to become fresher, showed them they\r\nwere nearing the game, when suddenly the trail took a sharp turn\r\nto the right, even returning towards the lake.  A little farther\r\nit took another sharp turn, then followed a series of doublings,\r\nwhile still farther the ground was completely denuded of trees,\r\nits torn-up and trampled condition and the enormous amount of\r\nstill warm blood showing how terrific a battle had just taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhile they looked about they saw what appeared to be the trunk of\r\na tree about four feet in diameter and six feet long, with a\r\nslight crook.  On coming closer, they recognized in it one of the\r\nforefeet of the mammoth, cut as cleanly as though with a knife\r\nfrom the leg just above the ankle, and still warm.  A little\r\nfarther they found the huge trunk cut to slivers, and, just\r\nbeyond, the body of the unfortunate beast with three of its feet\r\ngone, and the thick hide cut and slashed like so much paper.  It\r\nstill breathed, and Ayrault, who had a tender heart, sent an\r\nexplosive ball into its skull, which ended its suffering.\r\n\r\nThe three hunters then surveyed the scene.  The largest and most\r\npowerful beast they had believed could exist lay before them\r\ndead, not from the bite of a snake or any other poison, but from\r\nmechanical injuries of which those they had inflicted formed but\r\na very small part, and literally cut to pieces.\r\n\r\n"I am curious to see the animal," said Cortlandt, "capable of\r\ndoing this, though nothing short of dynamite bombs would protect\r\nus from him."\r\n\r\n"As he has not stopped to eat his victim," said Bearwarden, "it\r\nis fair to suppose he is not carnivorous, and so must have had\r\nsome other motive than hunger in making the attack; unless we can\r\nsuppose that our approach frightened him away, which, with such\r\npower as he must possess, seems unlikely.  Let us see," he\r\ncontinued, "parts of two legs remain unaccounted for.  Perhaps,\r\non account of their shape, he has been able the more easily to\r\ncarry or roll them off, for we know that elephant foot makes a\r\ncapital dish."\r\n\r\n"From the way you talk," said Cortlandt, "one would suppose you\r\nattributed this to men.  The Goliath we picture to ourselves\r\nwould be a child compared to the man that could cut through these\r\nlegs, though the necessity of believing him to have merely great\r\nsize does not disprove his existence here.  I think it probable\r\nwe shall find this is the work of some animal with incisors of\r\nsuch power as it is difficult for us to conceive of."\r\n\r\n"There is no indication here of teeth," said Bearwarden, "each\r\nfoot being taken off with a clean cut.  Besides, we are coming to\r\nbelieve that man existed on earth during the greater part, if not\r\nthe whole, of our Carboniferous period."\r\n\r\n"We must reserve our decision pending further evidence," said\r\nCortlandt.\r\n\r\n"I vote we take the heart," said Ayrault, "and cook it, since\r\notherwise the mammoth will be devoured before our eyes."\r\n\r\nWhile Bearwarden and Ayrault delved for this, Cortlandt, with\r\nsome difficulty, parted the mammoth\'s lips and examined the\r\nteeth.  "From the conical projections on the molars," said he,\r\n"this should be classed rather as a mastodon than as a mammoth."\r\n\r\nWhen the huge heart was secured, Bearwarden arranged slices on\r\nsharpened sticks, while Ayrault set about starting a fire.  He\r\nhad to use Cortlandt\'s gun to clear the dry wood of snakes,\r\nwhich, attracted doubtless by the dead mastodon, came in such\r\nnumbers that they covered the ground, while huge pterodactyls,\r\nmore venomous-looking than the reptiles, hovered about the\r\nopening above.\r\n\r\nArranging a double line of electric wires in a circle about the\r\nmastodon and themselves, they sat down and did justice to the\r\nmeal, with appetites that might have dismayed the waiting throng.\r\nWhenever a snake\'s head came in contact with one wire, while his\r\ntail touched the other, he gave a spasmodic leap and fell back\r\ndead.  If he happened to fall across the wires, lie immediately\r\nbegan to sizzle, a cloud of smoke arose, and lie was reduced to\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n"Any time that we are short of mastodon or other good game," said\r\nAyrault, "we need not hunger if we are not above grilled snake."\r\n\r\nAll laughed at this, and Bearwarden, drawing a whiskey-flask from\r\nhis pocket, passed it to his friends.\r\n\r\n"When we rig our fishing-tackle," he continued, "and have fresh\r\nfish for dinner, an entree of rattlesnake, roast mastodon for the\r\npiece de resistance, and begin the whole with turtle soup and\r\nclams, of which there must be plenty on the ocean beach, we shall\r\nwant to stay here the rest of our lives."\r\n\r\n"I suspect we shall have to," replied Ayrault "for we shall\r\nbecome so like Thanksgiving turkeys that the Callisto\'s door will\r\nbe too small for us."\r\n\r\nWhile they sat and talked, the flowers and plants about them\r\nsoftly began their song, and, as a visual accompaniment, the\r\nfire-flies they had not before noticed twinkled through the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n"My goodness! " exclaimed Cortlandt, "how time goes here!  We\r\nstarted to get breakfast, and now it\'s growing dark."\r\n\r\nHastily cutting some thick but tender slices from the mastodon,\r\nand impaling them with the remains of the heart on a sharpened\r\nstake, they took up the wires, and the battery that had been\r\nsupplying the current, and retraced their steps by the way they\r\nhad come.  Their rubber-lined cowhide boots protected them from\r\nall but the largest snakes, and as these were for the most part\r\nalready enjoying their gorge, they trampled with impunity on\r\nthose that remained in their path.  When they had covered about\r\nhalf the distance to the raft, a huge boa-constrictor, which they\r\nhad mistaken for a branch, fell upon Cortlandt, pinioning his\r\narms and bearing him to the ground.  Dropping their loads,\r\nBearwarden and Ayrault threw themselves upon the monster with\r\ntheir hunting-knives with such vim that in a few seconds it beat\r\na hasty retreat, leaving, as it did so, a wake of phosphorescent\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" asked Bearwarden, helping him up.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least," replied Cortlandt.  "What surprises me is\r\nthat I am not.  The weight of that boa-constrictor would be very\r\ngreat on earth, and here I should think it would be simply\r\ncrushing."\r\n\r\nGroping their way through the rapidly growing darkness, they\r\nreached the raft without further adventure, and, once on the\r\nlake, had plenty of light.  Two moons, one at three quarters and\r\nthe other full, shone brightly, while the water was alive with\r\ngymnotuses and other luminous creatures.  Sitting and living upon\r\nthe cross-timbers, they looked up at the sky.  The Great Bear and\r\nthe north star had exactly the same relation to each other as\r\nwhen seen from the earth, while the other constellations and the\r\nMilky Way looked identically as when they had so often gazed at\r\nthem before, and some idea of the immensity of space was conveyed\r\nto them.  Here was no change; though they had travelled three\r\nhundred and eighty million miles, there was no more perceptible\r\ndifference than if they had not moved a foot.  Perhaps, they\r\nthought, to the telescopes--if there are any--among the stars,\r\nthe sun was seen to be accompanied by two small, dark companions,\r\nfor Jupiter and Saturn might be visible, or perhaps it seemed\r\nmerely as a slightly variable star, in years when sun-spots were\r\nnumerous, or as the larger planets in their revolutions\r\noccasionally intercepted a part of its light.  As they floated\r\nalong they noticed a number of what they took to be\r\nWill-o\'-the-wisps.  Several of these great globules of pale flame\r\nhovered about them in the air, near the surface of the water, and\r\nanon they rose till they hung above the trees, apparently having\r\nno forward or horizontal motion except when taken by the gentle\r\nbreeze, merely sinking and rising.\r\n\r\n"How pretty they are!" said Cortlandt, as they watched them.\r\n"For bodies consisting of marsh gas, they hold together\r\nwonderfully."\r\n\r\nPresently one alighted on the water near them.  It was\r\nconsiderably brighter than any glow-worm, and somewhat larger\r\nthan an arc lamp, being nearly three feet in diameter; it did not\r\nemit much light, but would itself have been visible from a\r\nconsiderable distance.  Cortlandt tried to touch it with a\r\nraft-pole, but could not reach far enough.  Presently a large\r\nfish approached it, swimming near the surface of the water.  When\r\nit was close to the Jack-o\'-lantern, or whatever it was, there\r\nwas a splash, the fish turned up its white under side, and, the\r\nbreeze being away from the raft, the fire-ball and its victim\r\nslowly floated off together.  There were frequently a dozen of\r\nthese great globules in sight at once, rising and descending, the\r\nobservers noticing one peculiarity, viz., that their brightness\r\nincreased as they rose, and decreased as they sank.\r\n\r\nAbout two and a half hours after sunset, or midnight according to\r\nJupiter time, they fell asleep, but about an hour later Cortlandt\r\nwas awakened by a weight on his chest.  Starting up, he perceived\r\na huge white-faced bat, with its head but a few inches from his.\r\nIts outstretched wings were about eight feet across, and it\r\nfastened its sharp claws upon him.  Seizing it by the throat, he\r\nstruggled violently.  His companions, awakened by the noise,\r\nquickly came to his rescue, grasping him just as he was in danger\r\nof being dragged off the raft, and in another moment Bearwarden\'s\r\nknife had entered the creature\'s spine.\r\n\r\n"This evidently belongs to the blood-sucking species," said\r\nCortlandt.  "I seem to be the target for all these beasts, and\r\nhenceforth shall keep my eyes open at night."\r\n\r\nAs day would break in but little over an hour, they decided to\r\nremain awake, and they pushed the dead bat overboard, where it\r\nwas soon devoured by fishes.  A chill had come upon the air, and\r\nthe incessant noise of the forms of life about them had in a\r\nmeasure ceased.\r\n\r\nCortlandt passed around a box of quinine as a preventive against\r\nmalaria, and again they lay back and looked at the stars.  The\r\nmost splendid sight in their sky now was Saturn.  At the\r\ncomparatively short distance this great planet was from them, it\r\ncast a distinct shadow, its vast rings making it appear twice its\r\nreal size.  With the first glimmer of dawn, the fire-balls\r\ndescended to the surface of the water and disappeared within it,\r\ntheir lights going out.  With a suddenness to which the explorers\r\nwere becoming accustomed, the sun burst upon them, rising as\r\nperpendicularly as at the earth\'s equator, and more than twice as\r\nfast, having first tinged the sky with the most brilliant hues.\r\n\r\nThe stream had left the forest and swamp, and was now flowing\r\nthrough open country between high banks.  Pushing the raft\r\nashore, they stepped off on the sand, and, warming up the remains\r\nof the mastodon\'s heart, ate a substantial breakfast.\r\n\r\nWhile washing their knives in the stream preparatory to leaving\r\nit--for they wished to return to the Callisto by completing the\r\ncircle they had begun--they noticed a huge flat jelly-fish in\r\nshallow water.  It was so transparent that they could see the\r\nsandy bottom through it.  As it seemed to be asleep, Bearwarden\r\nstirred up the water around it and poked it with a stick.  The\r\njelly- fish first drew itself together till it touched the\r\nsurface of the water, being nearly round, then it slowly left the\r\nstream and rose till it was wholly in the air, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the sunlight, it emitted a faint glow.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed Bearwarden, "here we have one of our\r\nJack-o\'-lanterns.  Let us see what it is going to do."\r\n\r\n"It is incomprehensible to me," said Cortlandt, "how it maintains\r\nitself; for it has neither wings nor visible means of support,\r\nyet, as it was able to immerse itself in the stream, thereby\r\ndisplacing a volume of liquid equivalent to its bulk, it must be\r\nat least as heavy as water."\r\n\r\nThe jelly-fish remained poised in the air until directly above\r\nthem, when it began to descend.\r\n\r\n"Stand from under!" cried Bearwarden, stepping back. "I, for one,\r\nshould not care to be touched."\r\n\r\nThe great soft mass came directly over the spot on which they had\r\nbeen standing, and stopped its descent about three feet from the\r\nground, parallel to which it was slowly carried by the wind.  A\r\nfew yards off, in the direction in which it was moving, lay a\r\nlong black snake asleep on the sand.  When directly over its\r\nvictim the jelly globule again sank till it touched the middle of\r\nthe reptile\'s back.  The serpent immediately coiled itself in a\r\nknot, but was already dead.  The jellyfish did not swallow, but\r\ncompletely surrounded its prey, and again rose in the air, with\r\nthe snake\'s black body clearly visible within it.\r\n\r\n"Our Will-o\'-the-wisp is prettier by night than by day," said\r\nBearwarden.  "I suggest that we investigate this further."\r\n\r\n"How?" asked Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"By destroying its life," replied Bearwarden.  "Give it one\r\nbarrel from your gun, doctor, and see if it can then defy\r\ngravitation."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Cortlandt took careful aim at the object, about\r\ntwenty-yards away, and fired.  The main portion of the jellyfish,\r\nwith the snake still in its embrace, sailed away, but many pounds\r\nof jelly fell to the ground.  Most of this remained where it had\r\nfallen, but a few of the larger pieces showed a faint luminosity\r\nand rose again.\r\n\r\n"You cannot kill that which is simply a mass of protoplasm," said\r\nCortlandt.  "Doubtless each of those pieces will form a new\r\norganism.  This proves that there are ramifications and\r\ndevelopments of life which we never dreamed of."\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                        AN UNSEEN HUNTER.\r\n\r\nThey calculated that they had come ten or twelve miles from the\r\nplace at which they built the raft, while the damp salt breeze\r\nblowing from the south showed them they were near the ocean.\r\nConcluding that large bodies of water must be very much alike on\r\nall planets, they decided to make for a range of hills due north\r\nand a few miles off, and to complete the circuit of the square in\r\nreturning to the Callisto.  The soft wet sand was covered with\r\nhuge and curious tracks, doubtless made by creatures that had\r\ncome to the stream during the night to drink, and they noticed\r\nwith satisfaction as they set out that the fresher ones led off\r\nin the direction in which they were going.  For practice, they\r\nblew off the heads of the boa-constrictors as they hung from the\r\ntrees, and of the other huge snakes that moved along the ground,\r\nwith explosive bullets, in every thicket through which they\r\npassed, knowing that the game, never having been shot at, would\r\nnot take fright at the noise.  Sometimes they came upon great\r\nmasses of snakes, intertwined and coiled like worms; in these\r\ncases Cortlandt brought his gun into play, raking them with\r\nduck-shot to his heart\'s content.  "As the function of these\r\nreptiles," he explained, "is to form a soil on which higher life\r\nmay grow, we may as well help along their metamorphosis by\r\nartificial means."  They were impressed by the tremendous\r\ncannon-like reports of their firearms, which they perceived at\r\nonce resulted from the great density of the Jovian atmosphere.\r\nAnd this was also a considerable aid to them in making muscular\r\nexertion, for it had just the reverse effect of rarefied mountain\r\nair, and they seldom had to expand their lungs fully in order to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nThe ground continued to be marked with very large footprints.\r\nOften the impressions were those of a biped like some huge bird,\r\nexcept that occasionally the creature had put down one or both\r\nforefeet, and a thick tail had evidently dragged nearly all the\r\ntime it walked erect.  Presently, coming to something they had\r\ntaken for a large flat rock, they were surprised to see it move.\r\nIt was about twelve feet wide by eighteen feet long, while its\r\nshell seemed at least a foot thick, and it was of course the\r\nlargest turtle they had ever seen.\r\n\r\n"Twenty-four people could dine at a table of this size with\r\nease," said Bearwarden, "while it would make soup for a regiment.\r\nI wonder if it belongs to the snapping or diamond-backed\r\nspecies."\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the monster again moved.\r\n\r\n"As it is heading in our direction," resumed Bearwarden, "I vote\r\nwe strike for a free pass," and, taking a run, he sprang with his\r\nspiked boots upon the turtle\'s shell and clambered upon the flat\r\ntop, which was about six feet from the ground.  He was quickly\r\nfollowed by Ayrault, who was not much ahead of Cortlandt, for,\r\nnotwithstanding his fifty years, the professor was very spry.\r\nThe tortoise was almost the exact counterpart of the Glyptodon\r\nasper that formerly existed on earth, and shambled along at a\r\njerky gait, about half as fast again as they could walk, and\r\nwhile it continued to go in their direction they were greatly\r\npleased.  They soon found that by dropping the butts of their\r\nrifles sharply and simultaneously on either side, just back of\r\nthe head, they could direct their course, by making their steed\r\nswerve away from the stamping.\r\n\r\n"It is strange," said Ayrault, "that, with the\r\nexception of the mastodon and this tortoise, we have seen\r\nnone of the monsters that seem to appear at the close of\r\nCarboniferous periods, although the ground is covered\r\nwith their tracks."\r\n\r\n"Probably we did not reach the grounds at the right time of day,"\r\nreplied Bearwarden.  "The large game doubtless stays in the woods\r\nand jungles till night."\r\n\r\n"I fancy," said Cortlandt, "we shall find representatives of all\r\nthe species that once lived upon the earth.  In the case of the\r\nsinging flowers and the Jack-o\'-lantern jelly-fish, we have, in\r\naddition, seen developments the existence of which no scientist\r\nhas ever before even suspected."\r\n\r\nOccasionally the tortoise stopped, whereupon they poked it from\r\nbehind with their knives.  It was a vicious-looking brute, and\r\nhad a huge horny beak, with which it bit off young trees that\r\nstood in its way as though they had been blades of grass.  They\r\nwere passing through a valley about half a mile wide, bordered on\r\neach side by woods, when Bearwarden suddenly exclaimed, "Here we\r\nhave it!" and, looking forward, they unexpectedly saw a head rise\r\nand remain poised about fifteen feet from the ground.  It was a\r\ndinosaur, and belonged to the scaled or armoured species.  In a\r\nfew moments another head appeared, and towered several feet above\r\nthe first.  The head was obviously reptilian, but had a beak\r\nsimilar to that of their tortoise.  The hind legs were developed\r\nlike those of a kangaroo, while the small rudimentary forepaws,\r\nwhich could be used as hands or for going quadruped-fashion, now\r\nhung down.  The strong thick tail was evidently of great use to\r\nthem when standing erect, by forming a sort of tripod.\r\n\r\n"How I wish we could take a pair of those creatures with us when\r\nwe return to the earth!" said Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"They would be trump cards," replied Bearwarden, "in a zoological\r\ngarden or a dime museum, and would take the wind out of the sails\r\nof all the other freaks."\r\n\r\nAs they lay flat on the turtle\'s back, the monsters gazed at them\r\nunconcernedly, munching the palm-tree fruit so loudly that they\r\ncould be heard a long distance.\r\n\r\n"Having nothing to fear from a tortoise," resumed Cortlandt,\r\n"they may allow us to stalk them.  We are in their eyes like\r\nhippocentaurs, except that we are part of a tortoise instead of\r\npart of a horse, or else they take us for a parasite or fibrous\r\ngrowth on the shell."\r\n\r\n"They would not have much to fear from us as we really are,"\r\nreplied Bearwarden, "were it not for our explosive bullets."\r\n\r\n"I am surprised," said Ayrault, "that graminivorous animals\r\nshould be so heavily armed as these, since there can be no great\r\nstruggle in obtaining their food."\r\n\r\n"From the looks of their jaws," replied Cortlandt, "I should say\r\nthey are omnivorous, and would doubtless prefer meat to what they\r\nare eating now.  Something seems to have gone wrong with the\r\nanimal creation hereabouts to-day."\r\n\r\nTheir war-horse clanked along like a badly rusted machine,\r\napproaching the dinosaurs obliquely.  When only about fifty yards\r\nintervened, as the hunters were preparing to aim, their attention\r\nwas diverted by a tremendous commotion in the woods on their left\r\nand somewhat ahead.  With the crunching of dead branches and\r\nswaying of the trees, a drove of monsters made a hasty exit and\r\nsped across the open valley.  Some showed only the tops of their\r\nbacks above the long grass, while others shambled and leaped with\r\ntheir heads nearly thirty feet above the ground.  The dinosaurs\r\ninstantly dropped on all-fours and joined in the flight, though\r\nat about half-minute intervals they rose on their hind legs and\r\nfor a few seconds ran erect.  The drove passed about half a mile\r\nbefore the travellers, and made straight for the woods opposite;\r\nbut hardly had the monsters been out of sight two minutes when\r\nthey reappeared, even more precipitately than before, and fled up\r\nthe valley in the same direction as the tortoise.\r\n\r\n"The animals here," said Bearwarden, "behave as though they were\r\ngoing to catch a train; only our friend beneath us seems superior\r\nto haste."\r\n\r\n"I would give a good deal to know," said Cortlandt, "what is\r\npursuing those giants, and whether it is identical or similar to\r\nthe mutilator of the mastodon.  Nothing but abject terror could\r\nmake them run like that."\r\n\r\n"I have a well-formed idea," said Bearwarden, "that a hunt is\r\ngoing on, with no doubt two parties, one in the woods on either\r\nside, and that the hunters may be on a scale commensurate with\r\nthat of their victims."\r\n\r\n"If the excitement is caused by men," replied Cortlandt, "our\r\nexploration may turn out to be a far more difficult undertaking\r\nthan we anticipated.  But why, if there are men in those woods,\r\ndo they not show themselves?--for they could certainly keep pace\r\nwith the game more easily in the open than among the trees."\r\n\r\n"Because," replied Bearwarden, "the men in the woods are\r\ndoubtless the beaters, whose duty it is to drive the game into\r\nand up the valley, at the end of which the killing will be done."\r\n\r\n"We may have a chance to see it," said Ayrault, "or to take a\r\nhand, for we are travelling straight in that direction, and shall\r\nbe able to give a good account ourselves if our rights are\r\nchallenged."\r\n\r\n"Why," asked Cortlandt, "if the hunting parties that have been in\r\nour vicinity were only beaters, should they have mutilated the\r\nmastodon in such it way that he could not walk?  And how were\r\nthey able to take themselves off so quickly--for man in his\r\nnatural state has never been a fast mover?  I repeat, it will\r\nupset my theories if we find men."\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to them that tortoises were not much troubled by\r\nthe apparently general foe, for the specimen in which they were\r\njust then interested continued his course entirely unconcerned.\r\nSoon, however, he seemed to feel fatigue, for he drew his feet\r\nand head within his shell, which he tightly closed, and after\r\nthat no poking or prodding had the desired effect.\r\n\r\n"I suspect we must depend on shank\'s mares for a time," said\r\nBearwarden, cheerfully, as they scrambled down.\r\n\r\n"We can now see," said Cortlandt, "why our friend was so\r\nunconcerned, since he has but to draw himself within himself to\r\nbecome invulnerable to anything short of a stroke of lightning;\r\nfor no bird could have power enough to raise and drop him from a\r\ngreat height upon rocks, as the eagles do on earth."\r\n\r\n"I suspect, if anxious for turtle soup," said Bearwarden, "we\r\nmust attach a lightning--rod, and wait for a thunderstorm to\r\nelectrocute him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                      SPORTSMEN\'S REVERIES.\r\n\r\nFeeling grateful to the huge tortoise for the good service he had\r\nrendered, they shot a number of the great snakes that were\r\ngliding about on the ground, and placed them where he would find\r\nthem on awaiting.  They then picked their way carefully towards\r\nstretches on which the grass was shortest.  When they had gone\r\nabout two miles, and had already reached higher ground, they came\r\nto a ridge of rock running at right angles to their course.  This\r\nthey climbed, and on looking over the edge of the crest beheld a\r\nsight that made their hearts stand still.  A monster, somewhat\r\nresembling an alligator, except that the back was arched, was\r\nwaddling about perhaps seventy- five yards from them.  It was\r\nsixty feet long, and to the top of its scales was at least\r\ntwenty-five feet high.  It was constantly moving, and the\r\ntravellers noticed with some dismay that its motion was far more\r\nrapid than they would have supposed it could be.\r\n\r\n"It is also a dinosaur," said the professor, watching it sharply,\r\n"and very closely resembles the Stegosaurus ungulatus restored in\r\nthe museums.  The question is, What shall we do with the living\r\nspecimen, now that we have it?"\r\n\r\n"Our chairman," said Ayrault, "must find a way to kill it, so\r\nthat we may examine it closely."\r\n\r\n"The trouble is," said Bearwarden, "our bullets will explode\r\nbefore they penetrate the scales.  In the absence of any way of\r\nmaking a passage for an explosive ball by means of a solid one,\r\nwe must strike a vital spot.  His scales being no harder than the\r\ntrunk of a tree, we can wound him terribly by touching him\r\nanywhere; but there is no object in doing this unless we can kill\r\nhim, especially as there is no deep stream, such as would have\r\ndelayed the mastodon in reaching us, to protect us here.  We must\r\nspread out so as to divert his attention from one to another."\r\n\r\nAfter some consultation it was decided that Cortlandt, who had\r\nonly a shot-gun, should remain where they were, while Bearwarden\r\nand Ayrault moved some distance to the right and left.  At a\r\nsignal from Cortlandt, who was to attract the monster\'s\r\nattention, the wings were to advance simultaneously.  These\r\narrangements they carried out to the letter.  When Bearwarden and\r\nAyrault had gone about twenty-five yards on either side, the\r\ndoctor imitated the peculiar grunting sound of an alligator, at\r\nwhich the colossal monster turned and faced him, while Bearwarden\r\nand Ayrault moved to the attack.  The plan of this was good, for,\r\nwith his attention fixed on three objects, the dinosaur seemed\r\nconfused, and though Bearwarden and Ayrault had good angles from\r\nwhich to shoot, there was no possibility of their hitting each\r\nother.  They therefore advanced steadily with their rifles half\r\nup.  Though their own danger increased with each step, in the\r\nevent of their missing, the chance of their shooting wild\r\ndecreased, the idea being to reach the brain through the eye.\r\nCortlandt\'s part had also its risks, for, being entirely\r\ndefenceless with his shot-gun against the large creature, whose\r\nattention it was his duty to attract, he staked all on the\r\nmarksmanship of his friends.  Not considering this, however, he\r\nstood his ground, having the thumb-piece on his Winchester\r\nmagazine shoved up and ready to make a noisy diversion if\r\nnecessary in behalf of either wing.  Having aroused the monster\'s\r\ncuriosity, Cortlandt sprang up, waving his arms and his gun.  The\r\ndinosaur lowered his head as if to charge, thereby bringing it to\r\na level with the rifles, either of which could have given it the\r\nfatal shot.  But as their fingers pressed the triggers the\r\nreptile soared up thirty feet in the air.  Ayrault pulled for his\r\nfirst sight, shooting through the lower jaw, and shivering that\r\nmember, while Bearwarden changed his aim and sighted straight for\r\nthe heart.  In an instant the monster was down again, just\r\nmissing Ayrault\'s head as he stepped back, and Bearwarden\'s rifle\r\npoured a stream of explosive balls against its side, rending and\r\nblowing away the heavy scales.  Having drawn the dinosaur\'s\r\nattention to himself, he retreated, while Ayrault renewed the\r\nattack.  Cortlandt, seeing that the original plan had miscarried,\r\npoured showers of small shot against the huge beast\'s face.\r\nFinally, one of Ayrault\'s balls exploded in the brain, and all\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\n"We have killed it at last," said Bearwarden "but the first\r\nattack, though artistic, had not the brilliant results we\r\nexpected.  These creatures\' mode of fighting is doubtless\r\nsomewhat similar to that of the kangaroo, which it is said puts\r\nits forepaws gently, almost lovingly, on a man\'s shoulders, and\r\nthen disembowels him by the rapid movement of a hind leg.  But we\r\nshall get used to their method, and can do better next time."\r\n\r\nThey then reloaded their weapons and, while Cortlandt examined\r\ntheir victim from a naturalist\'s point of view, Bearwarden and\r\nAyrault secured the heart, which they thought would be the most\r\nedible part, the operation being rendered possible by the amount\r\nof armour the explosive balls had stripped off.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow," said Bearwarden, "we must make it a point to get\r\nsome well-fed birds; for I can roast, broil, or fricassee them to\r\na turn.  Life is too short to live on this meat in such a\r\nsportsman\'s paradise.  In any case there can be no end of\r\nmastodons, mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, moa birds, and all such\r\nshooting."\r\n\r\nAs the sun was already near the horizon, they chose a dry, sandy\r\nplace, to secure as much immunity as possible from nocturnal\r\nvisits, and, after procuring a supply of water from a pool,\r\nproceeded to arrange their camp for the night.  They first laid\r\nout the protection- wires, setting them while the sun still\r\nshone.  Next they built a fire and prepared their evening meal.\r\nWhile they ate it, twilight became night, and the fire-flies,\r\ntwinkling in legions in the neighbouring valley, seemed like the\r\nlamps of a great city.\r\n\r\n"Their lights," said Bearwarden, pointing to them, "are not as\r\nfine as the jelly-fish Will-o\'-the wisps were last night, but\r\nthey are not so dangerous.  No gymnotus or electric eel that I\r\nhave ever seen compared with them, and I am convinced that any\r\none of us they might have touched would have been in kingdom\r\ncome."\r\n\r\nThe balmy air soothed the travellers\' brows as they reclined\r\nagainst mounds of sand, while the flowers in the valley sent up\r\ntheir dying notes.  One by one the moons arose, till four--among\r\nthem the Lilliputian, discovered by Prof. Barnard in 1893--were\r\nin the sky, flooding the landscape with their silvery light, and\r\nsomething in the surroundings touched a sympathetic cord in the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n"Oh that I were young again," said Cortlandt, "and had life\r\nbefore me!  I should like to remain here and grow up with this\r\nplanet, in which we already perceive the next New World.  The\r\nbeauties of earth are barren compared with the scenes we have\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"You remember," replied Bearwarden, "how Cicero defends old age\r\nin his De Senectute, and shows that while it has almost\r\neverything that youth has, it has also a sense of calm and many\r\nthings besides."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Cortlandt, "but, while plausible, it does not\r\nconvince.  The pleasures of age are largely negative, the old\r\nbeing happy when free from pain."\r\n\r\n"Since the highest joy of life," said Ayrault, "is coming to know\r\nour Creator, I should say the old, being further advanced, would\r\nbe the happier of the two.  I should never regard this material\r\nlife as greatly to be prized for itself.  You remember the old\r\nsong:\r\n           "\'O Youth!  When we come to consider\r\n               The pain, the toil, and the strife,\r\n           The happiest man of all is\r\n               The one who has finished his life.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n"I suspect," continued Ayrault, "that the man who reaches even\r\nthe lowest plane in paradise will find far more beautiful visions\r\nthan any we have here."\r\n\r\nAs they had but little rest the night before, they were all\r\ntired.  The warm breeze swayed the long dry grass, causing it to\r\ngive out a soft rustle; all birds except the flitting bats were\r\nasleep among the tall ferns or on the great trees that spread\r\ntheir branches towards heaven.  There was nothing to recall a\r\npicture of the huge monsters they had seen that day, or of the\r\nstill more to be dreaded terror these had borne witness to.  Thus\r\nnight closes the activities of the day, and in its serene\r\ngrandeur the soul has time to think.  While they thought,\r\nhowever, drowsiness overcame them, and in a little while all were\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe double line of protection-wires encircled them like a silent\r\nguard, while the methodical ticking of the alarm-clock that was\r\nto wake them at the approach of danger, and register the hour of\r\ninterruption, formed a curious contrast to the irregular cries of\r\nthe night-hawks in the distance.  Time and again some huge\r\niguanodon or a hipsohopus would pass, shaking the ground with its\r\ntread; but so implicit was the travellers\' trust in the vigilance\r\nof their mechanical and tireless watch, that they slept on as\r\ncalmly and unconcernedly as though they had been in their beds at\r\nhome, while the tick was as constant and regular as a sentry\'s\r\nmarch.  The wires of course did not protect them from creatures\r\nhaving wings, and they ran some risk of a visitation from the\r\nblood-sucking bats.  The far-away volcanoes occasionally sent up\r\nsheets of flame, which in the distance were like summer\r\nlightning; the torrents of lava and crashes that had sounded so\r\nthunderous when near, were now like the murmur of the ocean\'s ebb\r\ntide, lulling the terrestrials to deeper sleep.  The pale moons\r\nwere at intervals momentarily obscured by the rushing clouds in\r\nthe upper air, only to reappear soon afterwards as serene as\r\nbefore.  All Nature seemed at rest.\r\n\r\nShortly before dawn there was an unusually heavy step.  A moment\r\nlater the ever-vigilant batteries poured forth their current, and\r\nthe clang of the alarm-bell made the still night ring.  In an\r\ninstant the three men were awake, each resting on one knee, with\r\ntheir backs towards the centre and their polished barrels raised.\r\nIt was not long before they perceived the intruder by the\r\nmoonlight.  A huge monster of the Triceratops prorsus species had\r\nentered the camp.  It was shaped something like an elephant, but\r\nhad ten or twelve times the bulk, being over forty feet in\r\nlength, not including the long, thick tail.  The head carried two\r\nhuge horns on the forehead and one on the nose.\r\n\r\n"A plague on my shot-gun!" said Cortlandt.  "Had I known how much\r\nof this kind of game we should see, I too should have brought a\r\nrifle."\r\n\r\nThe monster was entangled in the wires, and in another second\r\nwould have stepped on the batteries that were still causing the\r\nbell to ring.\r\n\r\n"Aim for the heart," said Bearwarden to Ayrault.  "When you show\r\nme his ribs, I will follow you in the hole."\r\n\r\nAyrault instantly fired for a point just back of the left\r\nforeleg.  The explosion had the same effect as on the mastodon,\r\nremoving a half-barrel of hide, etc; and the next second\r\nBearwarden sent a bullet less than an inch from where Ayrault\'s\r\nhad stopped.  Before the colossus could turn, each had caused\r\nseveral explosions in close proximity to the first.  The creature\r\nwas of course terribly wounded, and several ribs were cracked,\r\nbut no ball had gone through.  With a roar it made straight for\r\nthe woods, and with surprising agility, running fully as fast as\r\nan elephant.  Bearwarden and Ayrault kept up a rapid fire at the\r\nleft hind leg, and soon completely disabled it.  The dinosaur,\r\nhowever, supported itself with its huge tail, and continued to\r\nmake good time.  Knowing they could not give it a fatal wound at\r\nthe intervening distance, in the uncertain light, they stopped\r\nfiring and set out in pursuit.  Cortlandt paused to stop the bell\r\nthat still rang, and then put his best foot foremost in regaining\r\nhis friends.  For half a mile they hurried along, until, seeing\r\nby the quantity of blood on the ground that they were in no\r\ndanger of losing the game, they determined to save their\r\nstrength.  The trail entered the woods by a narrow ravine, passed\r\nthrough what proved to be but a belt of timber, and then turned\r\nnorth to the right.  Presently in the semi-darkness they saw the\r\nmonster\'s head against the sky.  He was browsing among the trees,\r\ntearing off the young branches, and the hunters succeeded in\r\ngetting within seventy-five yards before being discovered.  Just\r\nas he began to run, the two rifles again fired, this time at the\r\nright hind leg, which they succeeded in hamstringing.  After that\r\nthe Triceratops prorsus was at their mercy, and they quickly put\r\nan end to its suffering.\r\n\r\n"The sun is about to rise," said Bearwarden; "in a few minutes we\r\nshall have enough light."\r\n\r\nThey cut out a dozen thick slices of tenderloin steak, and soon\r\nwere broiling and eating a substantial breakfast.\r\n\r\n"There are not as many spectators to watch us eat here," said\r\nCortlandt, "as in the woods.  I suggest that, after returning to\r\ncamp for our blankets and things, we steer for the Callisto, via\r\nthis Triceratops, to see what creatures have been attracted by\r\nthe body."\r\n\r\nOn finishing their meal they returned to the place at which they\r\nhad passed the night.  Having straightened the protection-wires,\r\nwhich had become twisted, and arranged their impedimenta, they\r\nset out, and were soon once more beside their latest victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                       THE HONEY OF DEATH.\r\n\r\nAt first nothing seemed to have been disturbed, when they\r\nsuddenly perceived that both forelegs were missing.  On further\r\nexamination they found that the ponderous tail, seven feet in\r\ndiameter, was cut through in two places, the thicker portion\r\nhaving disappeared, and that the heavy bones in this extremity of\r\nthe vertebral column had been severed like straws.  The cut\r\nsurfaces were but little cooler than the interior of the body,\r\nshowing how recently the mutilation had been effected.\r\n\r\n"By all the gods!" exclaimed Bearwarden, "it is easy to see the\r\nmethod in this; the hunters have again cut off only those parts\r\nthat could be easily rolled.  These Jovian fellows must have\r\nweapons compared with which the old scythe chariots would be but\r\ntoys, with which they amputate the legs of their victims.  We\r\nmust see to it that their scimitars do not come too near to us,\r\nand I venture to hope that in our bullets they will find their\r\nmatch.  What say you, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"I see no depression such as such heavy bodies would necessarily\r\nhave made had they been rolled along the ground, neither does it\r\nseem to me that these curious tracks in the sand are those of\r\nmen."\r\n\r\nThe loose earth looked as if the cross-ties of some railroad had\r\nbeen removed, the space formerly occupied having been but partly\r\nfilled, and these depressions were across the probable direction\r\nof motion.\r\n\r\n"Whatever was capable of chasing mastodons and carrying such\r\nweights," said Ayrault, "will, I suspect, have little to fear\r\nfrom us.  Probably nothing short of light artillery would leave\r\nmuch effect."\r\n\r\n"I dare say," replied Bearwarden, "we had better give the unknown\r\nquantity a wide berth, though I would give a year\'s salary to see\r\nwhat it is like.  The absence of other tracks shows that his\r\nconfreres leave \'Scissor- jaw\' alone."\r\n\r\nKeeping a sharp lookout in all directions, they resumed their\r\nmarch along the third side of the square which was to bring them\r\nback to the Callisto.  Their course was parallel to the stream,\r\nand on comparatively high ground.  Cortlandt\'s gun did good\r\nservice, bringing down between fifty and sixty birds that usually\r\nallowed them to get as near as they pleased, and often seemed\r\nunwilling to leave their branches.  By the time they were ready\r\nfor luncheon they saw it would be dark in an hour.  As the\r\nrapidity of the planet\'s rotation did not give them a chance to\r\nbecome tired, they concluded not to pitch their camp, but to\r\nresume the march by moonlight, which would be easy in the high,\r\nopen country they were traversing.\r\n\r\nWhile in quest of fire-wood, they came upon great heaps of bones,\r\nmostly those of birds, and were attracted by the tall,\r\nbell-shaped flowers growing luxuriantly in their midst.  These\r\nexhaled a most delicious perfume, and at the centre of each\r\nflower was a viscous liquid, the colour of honey.\r\n\r\n"If this tastes as well as it looks," said Bearwarden, "it will\r\ncome in well for dessert"; saying which he thrust his finger into\r\nthe recesses of the flower, intending to taste the essence.\r\nQuietly, but like a flash, the flower closed, his hand being\r\nnearly caught and badly scratched by the long, sharp thorns that\r\nnow appeared at the edges.\r\n\r\n"Ha!" he exclaimed, "a sensitive and you may almost say a\r\nman-eating plant.  This doubtless has been the fate of these\r\nbirds, whose bones now lie bleaching at its feet after they have\r\nnourished its lips with their lives.  No doubt the plant has use\r\nfor them still, since their skeletons may serve to fertilize its\r\nroots."\r\n\r\nWishing to investigate further, Bearwarden placed one of the\r\nbirds they had shot within the bell of another flower, which\r\nimmediately contracted with such force that they saw drops of\r\nblood squeezed out.  After some minutes the flower opened, as\r\nbeautiful as ever, and discharged an oblong ball compressed to\r\nabout the size of a hen\'s egg, though the bird that was placed\r\nwithin it had been as large as a small duck.  Towards evening\r\nthese flowers sent up their most beautiful song, to hear which\r\nflocks of birds came from far and near, alighting on the trees,\r\nand many were lured to death by the siren strains and the honey.\r\n\r\nBefore resuming their journey, the travellers paid a parting\r\nvisit to the bell-shaped lilies on their pyramids of bones.  The\r\nflowers were closed for the night, and the travellers saw by the\r\nmoonlight that the white mounds were simply alive with\r\ndiamond-headed snakes.  These coiled themselves, flattened their\r\nheads, and set up such a hissing on the explorers\' approach that\r\nthey were glad to retire, and leave this curious contrast of\r\nhideousness and beauty to the fire-flies and the moons.  Marching\r\nalong in Indian file, the better to avoid treading on the\r\nwrithing serpents that strewed the ground, they kept on for about\r\ntwo hours.  They frequently passed huge heaps or mounds of bones,\r\nevidently the remains of bears or other large animals.  The\r\ncarnivorous plants growing at their centre were often like hollow\r\ntrees, and might easily have received the three travellers in one\r\nembrace.  But as before, the mounds were alive with serpents that\r\nevidently made them their homes, and raised an angry hiss\r\nwhenever the men approached.\r\n\r\n"The wonder to me," said Bearwarden, "is, that these snakes do\r\nnot protect the game, by keeping it from the life-devouring\r\nplants.  It may be that they do not show themselves by day or\r\nwhen the victims are near, or that the quadrupeds on which these\r\nplants live take a pleasure, like deer, in killing them by\r\njumping with all four feet upon their backs or in some other way,\r\nand after that are entrapped by the flowers."\r\n\r\nShortly after midnight they rested for a half hour, but the dawn\r\nfound them trudging along steadily, though somewhat wearily, and\r\nhaving about completed the third side of their square.\r\nAccordingly, they soon made a right-angle turn to the left, and\r\nhad been picking their way over the rough ground for nearly two\r\nhours, with the sun already high in the sky, when they noticed a\r\ndiminution of light.  Glancing up, they saw that one of the moons\r\nwas passing across the sun, and that they were on the eve of a\r\ntotal eclipse.\r\n\r\n"Since all but the fifth moon," said Cortlandt, "revolve exactly\r\nin the plane of Jupiter\'s equator, any inhabitants that settle\r\nthere will become accustomed to eclipses, for there must be one\r\nof the sun, and also of the moons, at each revolution, or about\r\nforty-five hundred in every Jovian year.  The reason we have seen\r\nnone before is, because we are not exactly on the equator."\r\n\r\nThey had a glimpse of the coronal streamers as the last portion\r\nof the sun was covered, and all the other phenomena that attend\r\nan eclipse on earth.  For a few minutes there was a total return\r\nto night.  The twinkling stars and other moons shone tranquilly\r\nin the sky, and even the noise of the insects ceased.  Presently\r\nthe edge of the sun that had been first obscured reappeared, and\r\nthen Nature went through the phenomenon of an accelerated dawn.\r\nWithout awaiting a full return of light, the travellers proceeded\r\non their way, and had gone something over a hundred yards when\r\nAyrault, who was marching second, suddenly grasped Bearwarden,\r\nwho was in front, and pointed to a jet-black mass straight ahead,\r\nand about thirty yards from a pool of warm water, from which a\r\ncloud of vapour arose.  The top of the head was about seven feet\r\nhigh, and the length of the body exceeded thirty feet.  The six\r\nlegs looked as strong as steel cables, and were about a foot\r\nthrough, while a huge, bony proboscis nine feet in length\r\npreceded the body.  This was carried horizontally between two and\r\nthree feet from the ground.  Presently a large ground sloth came\r\nto the pool to drink, lapping up the water at the sides that had\r\npartly cooled.  In an instant the black armored monster rushed\r\ndown the slope with the speed of a nineteenth-century locomotive,\r\nand seemed about as formidable.  The sloth turned in the\r\ndirection of the sound, and for a moment seemed paralyzed with\r\nfear; it then started to run, but it was too late, for the next\r\nsecond the enormously exaggerated ant--for such it was--overtook\r\nit.  The huge mandible shears that when closed had formed the\r\nproboscis, snapped viciously, taking off the sloth\'s legs and\r\nthen cutting its body to slivers.  The execution was finished in\r\na few seconds, and the ponderous insect carried back about half\r\nthe sloth to its hiding-place, where it leisurely devoured it.\r\n\r\n"This reminds me," said Bearwarden, "of the old lady who never\r\ncompleted her preparations for turning in without searching for\r\nburglars under the bed.  Finally she found one, and exclaimed in\r\ndelight, \'I\'ve been looking for you fifty years, and at last you\r\nare here!\'  The question is, now that we have found our burglar,\r\nwhat shall we do with him?"\r\n\r\n"I constantly regret not having a rifle," replied Cortlandt,\r\n"though it is doubtful if even that would help us here."\r\n\r\n"Let us sit down and wait," said Ayrault; "there may be an\r\nopening soon."\r\n\r\nAnon a woolly rhinoceros, resembling the Rhinoceros tichorhinus\r\nthat existed contemporaneously on earth with the mammoth, came to\r\ndrink the water that had partly cooled.  It was itself a\r\nformidable-looking beast, but in an instant the monster again\r\nrushed from concealment with the same tremendous speed.  The\r\nrhinoceros turned in the direction of the sound, and, lowering\r\nits head, faced the foe.  The ant\'s shears, however, passed\r\nbeneath the horn, and, fastening upon the left foreleg, cut it\r\noff with a loud snap.\r\n\r\n"Now is our chance," exclaimed Cortlandt; "we may kill the brute\r\nbefore he is through with the rhinoceros."\r\n\r\n"Stop a bit, doctor," said Bearwarden.  "We have a good record so\r\nfar; let us keep up our reputation for being sports.  Wait till\r\nhe can attend to us."\r\n\r\nThe encounter was over in less than a minute, three of the\r\nrhinoceros\'s legs being taken off, and the head almost severed\r\nfrom the body.  Taking up the legs in its mandibles, the\r\nmurderous creature was returning to its lair, when, with the cry\r\nof "Now for the fray!"  Bearwarden aimed beneath the body and\r\nblew off one of the farther armoured legs, from the inside.\r\n"Shoot off the legs on the same side," he counselled Ayrault,\r\nwhile he himself kept up a rapid fire.  Cortlandt tried to\r\ndisconcert the enemy by raining duck-shot on its scale- protected\r\neyes, while the two rifles tore off great masses of the horn that\r\ncovered the enormously powerful legs.  The men separated as they\r\nretreated, knowing that one slash of the great shears would cut\r\ntheir three bodies in halves if they were caught together.  The\r\nmonster had dropped the remains of the rhinoceros when attacked,\r\nand made for the hunters at its top speed, which was somewhat\r\nreduced by the loss of one leg.  Before it came within cutting\r\ndistance, however, another on the same side was gone, Ayrault\r\nhaving landed a bullet on a spot already stripped of armour.\r\nAfter this the men had no difficulty in keeping out of its way,\r\nthough it still moved with some speed, snipping off young trees\r\nin its path like grass.  Finally, having blown the scales from\r\none eye, the travellers sent in a bullet that exploded in the\r\nbrain and ended its career.\r\n\r\n"This has been by all odds the most exciting hunt we have had,"\r\nsaid Ayrault, "both on account of the determined nature and great\r\nspeed of the attack, and the almost impossibility of finding a\r\nvulnerable spot."\r\n\r\n"Anything short of explosive bullets," added Bearwarden, "would\r\nhave been powerless against this beast, for the armour in many\r\nplaces is nearly a foot thick."\r\n\r\n"This is also the most extraordinary as well as most dangerous\r\ncreature with which we have, had to deal," said Cortlandt,\r\n"because it is an enormously enlarged insect, with all the\r\ninherent ferocity and strength.  It is almost the exact\r\ncounterpart of an African soldier-ant magnified many hundred\r\nthousand times.  I wonder," he continued thoughtfully, "if our\r\nlatter-day insects may not be the deteriorated (in point of size)\r\ndescendants of the monsters of mythology and geology, for nothing\r\ncould be a more terrible or ferocious antagonist than many of our\r\nwell-known insects, if sufficiently enlarged.  No animal now\r\nalive has more than a small fraction of the strength, in\r\nproportion to its size, of the minutest spider or flea.  It may\r\nbe that through lack of food, difficulties imposed by changing\r\nclimate, and the necessity of burrowing in winter, or through\r\nsome other conditions changed from what they were accustomed to,\r\ntheir size has been reduced, and that the fire-flies, huge as\r\nthey seemed, are a step in advance of this specimen in the march\r\nof deterioration or involution, which will end by making them as\r\ninsignificant as those on earth.  These ants have probably come\r\ninto the woods to lay their eggs, for, from the behaviour of the\r\nanimals we watched from the turtle, there must have been several;\r\nor perhaps a war is in progress between those of a different\r\ncolour, as on earth, in which case the woods may be full of them.\r\nDoubtless the reason the turtle seemed so unconcerned at the\r\ngeneral uneasiness of the animals was because he knew he could\r\nmake himself invulnerable to the marauder by simply closing his\r\nshell, and we were unmolested because it did not occur to the ant\r\nthat any soft-shelled creatures could be on the turtle\'s back."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Bearwarden, "it will be the part of wisdom to\r\nreturn to the Callisto, and do the rest of our exploring on\r\nJupiter from a safe height; for, though we succeeded in disabling\r\nthis beauty, it was largely through luck, and had we not done so\r\nwe should probably have provided a bon bouche for our deceased\r\nfriend, instead of standing at his grave."\r\n\r\nAccordingly they proceeded, and were delighted, a few minutes\r\nlater, to see the sunlight reflected from the projectile\'s\r\npolished roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                      CHANGING LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Callisto, Ayrault worked the lock he had had\r\nplaced on the lower door, which, to avoid carrying a key, was\r\nopened by a combination.  The car\'s interior was exactly as they\r\nhad left it, and they were glad to be in it again.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Bearwarden, "we can have a sound and\r\nundisturbed sleep, which is what I want more than\r\nanything else.  No prowlers can trouble us here, and we\r\nshall not need the protection-wires."\r\n\r\nThey then opened a window in each side--for the large glass\r\nplates, admitting the sun when closed, made the Callisto rather\r\nwarm--and placed a stout wire netting within them to keep out\r\nbirds and bats, and then, though it was but little past noon, got\r\ninto their comfortable beds and slept nine hours at a stretch.\r\nTheir strong metal house was securely at rest, receiving the\r\nsunlight and shedding the rain and dew as it might have done on\r\nearth.  No winds or storms, lightnings or floods, could trouble\r\nit, while the multiformed monsters of antiquity and mythology\r\nrestored in life, with which the terrestrials had been thrown\r\ninto such close contact, roamed about its polished walls.  Not\r\neven the fiercest could affect them, and they would but see\r\nthemselves reflected in any vain assaults.  The domed symmetrical\r\ncylinder stood there as a monument to human ingenuity and skill,\r\nand the travellers\' last thought as they fell asleep was, "Man is\r\nreally lord of creation."\r\n\r\nThe following day at about noon they awoke, and had a bath in the\r\nwarm pool.  They saw the armoured mass of the great ant evidently\r\nundisturbed, while the bodies of its victims were already shining\r\nskeletons, and raised a small cairn of stones in memory of the\r\nstruggle they had had there.\r\n\r\n"We should name this place Kentucky," said Bearwarden, "for it is\r\nindeed a dark and bloody ground," and, seeing the aptness of the\r\nappellation, they entered it so on their charts.  While Ayrault\r\ngot the batteries in shape for resuming work.  Bearwarden\r\nprepared a substantial breakfast.  This consisted of oatmeal and\r\ncream kept hermetically sealed in glass, a dish of roast grouse,\r\ncoffee, pilot bread, a bottle of Sauterne, and another of Rhine\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n"This is the last meal we shall take hereabouts," said their\r\ncook, as they plied their knives and forks beneath the trees, "so\r\nhere is a toast to our adventures, and to all the game we have\r\nkilled."  They drained their glasses in drinking this, after\r\nwhich Bearwarden regaled them with the latest concert-hall song\r\nwhich he had at his tongue\'s end.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before dark they re-entered their projectile, and,\r\nas a mark of respect to their little ship, named the great branch\r\nof the continent on which they had alighted Callisto Point.  They\r\nthen got under way.  The batteries had to develop almost their\r\nmaximum power to overcome Jupiter\'s attraction; but they were\r\nequal to the task, and the Callisto was soon in the air.\r\nDirecting their apergy to the mountains towards the interior of\r\nthe continent, and applying repulsion to any ridge or hill over\r\nwhich they passed, thereby easing the work of the batteries\r\nengaged in supporting the Callisto, they were soon sweeping along\r\nat seventy-five to one hundred miles an hour.  By keeping the\r\nprojectile just strongly enough charged to neutralize\r\ngravitation, they remained for the most part within two hundred\r\nfeet of the ground, seldom rising to an altitude of more than a\r\nmile, and were therefore able to keep the windows at the sides\r\nopen and so obtain an unobstructed view.  If, however, at any\r\ntime they felt oppressed by Jupiter\'s high barometric pressure,\r\nand preferred the terrestrial conditions, they had but to rise\r\ntill the barometer fell to thirty.  Then, if an object of\r\ninterest recalled them to sea-level, they could keep the\r\nCallisto\'s inside pressure at what they found on the Jovian\r\nmountains, by screwing up the windows.  On account of the\r\ndistance of sixty-four thousand miles from Jupiter\'s equator to\r\nthe pole, they calculated that going at the speed of a hundred\r\nmiles an hour, night and day, it would take them twenty-five\r\nterrestrial days to reach the pole even from latitude two degrees\r\nat which they started.  But they knew that, if pressed for time,\r\nthey could rise above the limits of the atmosphere, and move with\r\nplanetary speed; while, if they wished a still easier method of\r\npursuing their observation, they had but to remain poised between\r\nthe sun and Jupiter, beyond the latter\'s upper air, and\r\nphotograph or map it as it revolved before them.\r\n\r\nBy sunset they had gone a hundred miles.  Wishing to push along,\r\nthey closed the windows, rose higher to avoid any mountain-tops\r\nthat might be invisible in the moonlight, and increased their\r\nspeed.  The air made a gentle humming sound as they shot through\r\nit, and towards morning they saw several bright points of light\r\nin which they recognized, by the aid of their glasses, sheets of\r\nflame and torrents of molten glowing lava, bursting at intervals\r\nor pouring steadily from several volcanoes.  From this they\r\nconcluded they were again near an ocean, since volcanoes need the\r\npresence of a large body of water to provide steam for their\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nWith the rising sun they found the scene of the day before\r\nentirely changed.  They were over the shore of a vast ocean that\r\nextended to the left as far as they could see, for the range of\r\nvision often exceeded the power of sight.  The coast-line ran\r\nalmost due north and south, while the volcanoes that dotted it,\r\nand that had been luminous during the night, now revealed their\r\nnature only by lines of smoke and vapours.  They were struck by\r\nthe boldness and abruptness of the scenery.  The mountains and\r\ncliffs had been but little cut down by water and frost action,\r\nand seemed in the full vigour of their youth, which was what the\r\ntravellers had a right to expect on a globe that was still\r\ncooling and shrinking, and consequently throwing up ridges in the\r\nshape of mountains far more rapidly than a planet as matured and\r\nquiescent as the earth.  The absence of lakes also showed them\r\nthat there had been no Glacial period, in the latitudes they were\r\ncrossing, for a very long time.\r\n\r\n"We can account for the absence of ice-action and scratches,"\r\nsaid Cortlandt, "in one of two ways.  Either the proximity of the\r\ninternal heat to the surface prevents water from freezing in all\r\nlatitudes, or Jupiter\'s axis has always been very nearly\r\nperpendicular to its orbit, and consequently the thermometer has\r\nnever been much below thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit; for, at the\r\nconsiderable distance we are now from the sun, it is easy to\r\nconceive that, with the axis much inclined, there might be cold\r\nweather, during the Northern hemisphere\'s winter, that would last\r\nfor about six of our years, even as near the equator as this.\r\nThe substantiation of an ice-cap at the pole will disprove the\r\nfirst hypothesis; for what we took for ice before alighting may\r\nhave been but banks of cloud, since, having been in the plane of\r\nthe planet\'s equator at the time, we had naturally but a very\r\noblique view of the poles; while the absence of glacial scratches\r\nshows, I take it, that though the axis may have been a good deal\r\nmore inclined than at present, it has not, at all events since\r\nJupiter\'s Palaeozoic period, been as much so as that of Uranus or\r\nVenus.  The land on Jupiter, corresponding to the Laurentian\r\nHills on earth, must even here have appeared at so remote a\r\nperiod that the first surface it showed must long since have been\r\nworn away, and therefore any impressions it received have also\r\nbeen erased.\r\n\r\n"Comparing this land with the photographs we took from space, I\r\nshould say it is the eastern of the two crescent-shaped\r\ncontinents we found apparently facing each other.  Their present\r\nform I take to be only the skeleton outline of what they will be\r\nat the next period of Jupiter\'s development.  They will, I\r\npredict, become more like half moons than crescents, though the\r\nprofile may be much indented by gulfs and bays, their superficial\r\narea being greatly increased, and the intervening ocean\r\ncorrespondingly narrowed.  We know that North America had a very\r\ndifferent shape during the Cretaceous or even the Middle Tertiary\r\nperiod from what it has now, and that the Gulf of Mexico extended\r\nup the valley of the Mississippi as far as the Ohio, by the\r\npresence of a great coral reef in the Ohio River near Cincinnati.\r\nWe know also that Florida and the Southeastern Atlantic States\r\nare a very recent addition to the continent, while the pampas of\r\nthe Argentine Republic have, in a geological sense, but just been\r\nupheaved from the sea, by the fact that the rivers are all on the\r\nsurface, not having had time to cut down their channels below the\r\nsurrounding country.  By similar reasoning, we know that the\r\ncanon of the Colorado is a very old region, though the\r\nprecipitateness of its banks is due to the absence of rain, for a\r\nlocal water-supply would cut back the banks, having most effect\r\nwhere they were steepest, since at those points it would move\r\nwith the greatest speed.  Thus the majestic canon owes its\r\nexistence to two things: the length of time the river has been at\r\nwork, and the fact that the water flowing through it comes from\r\nanother region where, of course, there is rain, and that it is\r\nmerely in transit, and so affects only the bed on which it moves.\r\nGranting that this is the eastern of the two continents we\r\nobserved, it evidently corresponds more in shape to the Eastern\r\nhemisphere on earth than to the New World, both of which are set\r\nfacing one another, since both drain towards the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nBut the analogy here holds also, for the past outlines of the\r\nEastern hemisphere differed radically from what they are now.\r\nThe Mediterranean Sea was formerly of far greater extent than we\r\nsee it to-day, and covered nearly the whole of northern Africa\r\nand the old upheaved sea-bottom that we see in the Desert of\r\nSahara.  Much of this great desert, as we know, has a\r\nconsiderable elevation, though part of it is still below the\r\nlevel of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps a more striking proof of this than are the remains of\r\nfishes and marine life that are found there, is the dearth of\r\nnatural harbours and indentations in Africa\'s northern coast,\r\nwhile just opposite, in southern Europe, there are any number;\r\nwhich shows that not enough time has elapsed since Africa\'s\r\nupheaval for liquid or congealed water to produce them.  Many of\r\nEurope\'s best harbours, and Boston\'s, in our country, have been\r\ndug out by slow ice-action in the oft-recurring Glacial periods.\r\nThe Black and Caspian Seas were larger than we now find them;\r\nwhile the Adriatic extended much farther into the continent,\r\ncovering most of the country now in the valley of the Po.  In\r\nEurope the land has, of course, risen also, but so slowly that\r\nthe rivers have been able to keep their channels cut down; proof\r\nof their ability to perform which feat we see when an ancient\r\nriver passes through a ridge of hills or mountains.  The river\r\nhad doubtless been there long before the mountains began to rise,\r\nbut their elevation was so gradual that the rate of the river\'s\r\ncutting down equalled or exceeded their coming up; proof of which\r\nwe have in the patent fact that the ancient river\'s course\r\nremains unchanged, and is at right angles to the mountain chain.\r\nFrom all of which we see that the Eastern hemisphere\'s crescent\r\nhollow--of which, I take it, the Mediterranean, Black, and\r\nCaspian Sea depressions are the remains--has been gradually\r\nfilled in, by the elevation of the sea\'s bottom, and the\r\nextension of deltas from the detrital matter brought from the\r\nhigh interior of the continents by the rivers, or by the combined\r\naction of the two.  Now, since the Gulf of Mexico has been\r\nconstantly growing smaller, and the Mediterranean is being\r\ninvaded by the land, I reason that similar causes will produce\r\nlike effects here, and give to each continent an area far greater\r\nthan our entire globe.  The stormy ocean we behold in the west,\r\nwhich corresponds to our Atlantic, though it is far more of a\r\nmare clausum in the geographical sense, is also destined to\r\nbecome a calm and placid inland sea.  There are, of course,\r\nmodifications of and checks to the laws tending to increase the\r\nland area.  England was formerly joined to the continent, the\r\nland connecting the two having been rather washed away by the\r\nwaves and great tides than by any sinking of the English\r\nChannel\'s bottom, the whole of which is comparatively shallow.\r\nAnother case of this kind is seen in Cape Cod and the islands of\r\nMartha\'s Vineyard and Nantucket, all of which are washing away so\r\nrapidly that they would probably disappear before the next\r\nGlacial period, were we not engaged in preventing its recurrence.\r\nThese detached islands and sand-bars once formed one large\r\nisland, which at a still earlier time undoubtedly was joined to\r\nthe mainland.  The sands forming the detached masses are in a\r\ngreat processional march towards the equator, but it is the\r\nresult simply of winds and waves, there being no indication of\r\nsubsidence.  Along the coast of New Jersey we see denudation and\r\nsinking going on together, the well-known SUNKEN FOREST being an\r\ninstance of the latter.  The border of the continent proper also\r\nextends many miles under the ocean before reaching the edge of\r\nthe Atlantic basin.  Volcanic eruptions sometimes demolish parts\r\nof headlands and islands, though these recompense us in the\r\namount of material brought to the surface, and in the increased\r\ndistance they enable water to penetrate by relieving the interior\r\nof part of its heat, for any land they may destroy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                        A JOVIAN NIAGARA.\r\n\r\nFour days later, after crossing a ridge of mountains that the\r\npressure on the aneroid barometer showed to be about thirty-two\r\nthousand feet high, and a stretch of flat country a few miles in\r\nwidth, they came to a great arm of the sea.  It was about thirty\r\nmiles wide at its mouth, which was narrowed like the neck of a\r\nbottle, and farther inland was over one hundred miles across, and\r\nthough their glasses, the clear air, and the planet\'s size\r\nenabled them to see nearly five hundred miles, they could not\r\nfind its end.  In the shallow water along      its shores, and on\r\nthe islands rising but a few feet     above the waves, they saw\r\nall kinds of amphibians and sea-monsters.  Many of these were\r\nalmost the exact reproduction in life of the giant plesiosaurs,\r\ndinosaurs, and elasmosaurs, whose remains are preserved in the\r\nmuseums on earth.  The reptilian bodies of the elasmosaurs,\r\nseventy-five feet in length, with the forked tongues, distended\r\njaws and fangs of a snake, were easily taken for the often\r\ndescribed but probably mythical sea- serpent, as partially coiled\r\nthey occasionally raised their heads twelve or fifteen feet.\r\n\r\n"Man in his natural state," said Cortlandt, "would have but small\r\nchance of surviving long among such neighbours.  Buckland, I\r\nthink, once indulged in the jeu d\'esprit of supposing an\r\nichthyosaur lecturing on the human skull.  \'You will at once\r\nperceive,\' said the lecturer, \'that the skull before us belonged\r\nto one of the lower order of animals.  The teeth are very\r\ninsignificant, the power of the jaws trifling, and altogether it\r\nseems wonderful how the creature could have procured food.\'\r\nArmed with modern weapons, and in this machine, we are, of\r\ncourse, superior to the most powerful monster; but it is not\r\nlikely that, had man been so surrounded during the whole of his\r\nevolution, he could have reached his present plane."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the striking similarity of these creatures to\r\ntheir terrestrial counterparts that existed on earth during its\r\ncorresponding period, there were some interesting modifications.\r\nThe organs of locomotion in the amphibians were more developed,\r\nwhile the eyes of all were larger, the former being of course\r\nnecessitated by the power of gravity, and the latter by the\r\ngreater distance from the sun.\r\n\r\n"The adaptability and economy of Nature," said Cortlandt, "have\r\nalways amazed me.  In the total blackness of the Kentucky Mammoth\r\nCave, where eyes would be of no use to the fishes, our common\r\nmother has given them none; while if there is any light, though\r\nnot as much as we are accustomed to, she may be depended upon to\r\nrise to the occasion by increasing the size of the pupil and the\r\npower of the eye.  In the development of the ambulatory muscles\r\nwe again see her handiwork, probably brought about through the\r\n\'survival of the fittest.\'  The fishes and those wholly immersed\r\nneed no increase in power, for, though they weigh more than they\r\nwould on earth, the weight of the water they displace is\r\nincreased at the same rate also, and their buoyancy remains\r\nunchanged.  If the development of life here so closely follows\r\nits lines on earth, with the exception of comparatively slight\r\nmodifications, which are exactly what, had we stopped to think,\r\nwe should have expected to find, may we not reasonably ask\r\nwhether she will not continue on these lines, and in time produce\r\nbeings like ourselves, but with more powerful muscles and eyes\r\ncapable of seeing clearly with less light?  Reasoning by analogy,\r\nwe can come to no other conclusion, unless their advent is\r\nanticipated by the arrival of ready-made colonists from the more\r\nadvanced earth, like ourselves.  In that case man, by pursuing\r\nthe same destructive methods that he has pursued in regard to\r\nmany other species, may exterminate the intervening links, and so\r\narrest evolution."\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Deepwaters Bay they secured a pail of its water,\r\nwhich they found, on examination, contained a far larger\r\npercentage of salt and solid material than the oceans on earth,\r\nwhile a thermometer that they immediately immersed in it soon\r\nregistered eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit; both of which\r\ndiscoveries confirmed them in what they already knew, namely,\r\nthat Jupiter had advanced comparatively little from the condition\r\nin which the water on the surface is hot, in which state the\r\nearth once was.\r\n\r\nThey were soon beyond the estuary at which they had stopped to\r\nstudy the forms of life and to make this test, and kept on due\r\nnorth for several days, occasionally rising above the air.  As\r\ntheir familiarity with their surroundings increased, they made\r\nnotes of several things.  The mountains covered far more\r\nterritory at their bases than the terrestrial mountains, and they\r\nwere in places very rugged and showed vast yawning chasms.  They\r\nwere also wooded farther up their sides, and bore but little\r\nsnow; but so far the travellers had not found them much higher\r\nthan those on earth, the greatest altitude being the thirty-two\r\nthousand feet south of Deepwaters Bay, and one other ridge that\r\nwas forty thousand; so that, compared with the size of the planet\r\nand its continents, they seemed quite small, and the continents\r\nthemselves were comparatively level.  They also noted that spray\r\nwas blown in vast sheets, till the ocean for miles was white as\r\nmilk.  The wind often attained tornado strength, and the whole\r\nsurface of the water, about what seemed to be the storm centre,\r\nfrequently moved with rapidity in the form of foam.  Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding this, the waves were never as large as those to\r\nwhich they were accustomed on earth.  This they accounted for\r\nvery easily by the fact that, while water weighed 2.55 times as\r\nmuch as on earth, the pressure of air was but little more than\r\nhalf as much again, and consequently its effect on all but the\r\nvery surface of the heavy liquid was comparatively slight.\r\n\r\n"Gravity is a useful factor here," observed Cortlandt, as they\r\nmade a note of this; "for, in addition to giving immunity from\r\nwaves, it is most effective in checking the elevation of high\r\nmountains or table-lands in the high latitudes, which we shall\r\ndoubtless find sufficiently cool, or even cold, while in tropical\r\nregions, which might otherwise be too hot, it interferes with\r\nthem least, on account of being partly neutralized by the rapid\r\nrotation with which all four of the major planets are blessed."\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the following morning they saw they were approaching\r\nanother great arm of the sea.  It was over a thousand miles wide\r\nat its mouth, and, had not the photographs showed the contrary,\r\nthey would have thought the Callisto had reached the northern end\r\nof the continent.  It extended into the land fifteen thousand\r\nmiles, and, on account of the shape of its mouth, they called it\r\nFunnel Bay.  Rising to a height, they flew across, and came to a\r\ngreat table-land peninsula, with a chain of mountains on either\r\nside.  The southern range was something over, and the northern\r\nsomething less than, five thousand feet in height, while the\r\ntable-land between sloped almost imperceptibly towards the\r\nmiddle, in which, as they expected, they found a river compared\r\nto which the Mississippi or the Amazon would be but a brook.  In\r\nhonour of the President of the Terrestrial Axis Straightening\r\nCompany, they called this great projection, which averaged about\r\nfour thousand miles across by twelve thousand miles long,\r\nBearwarden Peninsula.  They already noticed a change in climate;\r\nthe ferns and palms became fewer, and were succeeded by pines,\r\nwhile the air was also a good deal cooler, which was easily\r\naccounted for by their altitude--though even at that height it\r\nwas considerably denser than at sea- level on earth--and by the\r\nfact that they were already near latitude thirty.\r\n\r\nThe exposed points on the plateau, as also the summits of the\r\nfirst mountains they had seen before alighting, were devoid of\r\nvegetation, scarcely so much as a blade of grass being visible.\r\nSince they could not account for this by cold, they concluded\r\nthat the most probable explanation lay in the tremendous\r\nhurricanes that, produced by the planet\'s rapid rotation,\r\nfrequently swept along its surface, like the earth\'s trade-winds,\r\nbut with far more violence.    On reaching the northern coast of\r\nthe peninsula they increased their elevation and changed their\r\ncourse to northeast, not caring to remain long over the great\r\nbody of water, which they named Cortlandt Bay.  The thousands of\r\nmiles of foam fast flew beneath them, the first thing attracting\r\ntheir attention being a change in the ocean\'s colour.  In the\r\neastern shore of Cortlandt Bay they soon observed the mouth of a\r\nriver, ten miles across, from which this tinted water issued in a\r\nflood.  On account of its colour, which reminded them of a stream\r\nthey knew so well, they christened it the Harlem.\r\n\r\nBelieving that an expedition up its valley might reveal something\r\nof interest, they began the ascent, remaining at an elevation of\r\na few hundred feet.  For about three hundred miles they followed\r\nthis river, which had but few bends, while its sides became more\r\nand more precipitous, till it flowed through a canon four and a\r\nhalf miles across.  Though they knew from the wide discoloration\r\nof Cortlandt Bay that the volume of water discharged was\r\ntremendous, the stream seldom moved at a rate of more than five\r\nmiles an hour, and for a time was free from rocks and rapids,\r\nfrom which they concluded that it must be very deep.  Half an\r\nhour later they saw a cloud of steam or mist, which expanded, and\r\nalmost obscured the sky as they approached.  Next they heard a\r\nsound like distant thunder, which they took for the prolonged\r\neruption of some giant crater, though they had not expected to\r\nfind one so far towards the interior of the continent.  Presently\r\nit became one continuous roar, the echo in the canon, whose walls\r\nwere at this place over six hundred feet high, being simply\r\ndeafening, so that the near discharge of the heaviest artillery\r\nwould have been completely drowned.\r\n\r\n"One would think the end of the world was approaching!" shouted\r\nCortlandt through his hands.\r\n\r\n"Look!" Bearwarden roared back, "the wind is scattering the\r\nmist."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the vapoury curtain was drawn aside, revealing a\r\nwaterfall of such vast proportions as to dwarf completely\r\nanything they had ever seen or even imagined.  A somewhat open\r\nhorseshoe lip, three and a half miles straight across and over\r\nfour miles following the line of the curve, discharged a sheet of\r\nwater forty feet thick at the edge into an abyss six hundred feet\r\nbelow.  Two islands on the brink divided this sheet of liquid\r\ninto three nearly equal parts, while myriads of rainbows hovered\r\nin the clouds of spray.  Two things especially struck the\r\nobservers: the water made but little curve or sweep on passing\r\nover the edge, and then rushed down to the abyss at almost\r\nlightning speed, shivering itself to infinitesimal particles on\r\nstriking any rock or projection at the side.  Its behaviour was,\r\nof course, due to its weight, and to the fact that on Jupiter\r\nbodies fall 40.98 feet the first second, instead of sixteen feet,\r\nas on earth, and at correspondingly increasing speed.\r\n\r\nFinding that they were being rapidly dazed and stunned by the\r\nnoise, the travellers caused the Callisto to rise rapidly, and\r\nwere soon surveying the superb sight from a considerable\r\nelevation.  Their minds could grasp but slowly the full meaning\r\nand titanic power of what they saw, and not even the vast falls\r\nin their nearness could make their significance clear.  Here was\r\na sheet of water three and a half miles wide, averaging forty\r\nfeet in depth, moving at a rapid rate towards a sheer fall of six\r\nhundred feet.  They felt, as they gazed at it, that the power of\r\nthat waterfall would turn backward every engine and dynamo on the\r\nearth, and it seemed as if it might almost put out the fires of\r\nthe sun.  Yet it was but an illustration of the action of the\r\nsolar orb exerted on a vast area of ocean, the vapour in the form\r\nof rain being afterwards turned into these comparatively narrow\r\nlimits by the topography of the continent.  Compared with this,\r\nNiagara, with its descent of less than two hundred feet, and its\r\nrelatively small flow of water, would be but a rivulet, or at\r\nbest a rapid stream.    Reluctantly leaving the fascinating\r\nspectacle, they pursued their exploration along the river above\r\nthe falls.  For the first few miles the surface of the water was\r\nnear that of the land; there were occasional rapids, but few\r\nrocks, and the foaming torrent moved at great speed, the red\r\nsandstone banks of the river being as polished as though they had\r\nbeen waxed.  After a while the obstructions disappeared, but the\r\nwater continued to rush and surge along at a speed of ten or\r\ntwelve miles an hour, so that it would be easily navigable only\r\nfor logs or objects moving in one direction.  The surface of the\r\nriver was soon on an average fifty feet below the edge of the\r\nbanks, this depression being one result of the water\'s rapid\r\nmotion and weight, which facilitated the carving of its channel.\r\n\r\nWhen they had followed up the river about sixty miles towards its\r\nsource they came upon what at first had the appearance of an\r\nocean.  They knew, however, from its elevation, and the flood\r\ncoming from it, that the water must be fresh, as they soon found\r\nit was.  This lake was about three hundred miles wide, and\r\nstretched from northeast to southwest.  There was rolling land\r\nwith hills about its shores, and the foliage on the banks was a\r\nbeautiful shade of bluish purple instead of the terrestrial\r\nubiquitous green.\r\n\r\nWhen near the great lake\'s upper end, they passed the mouth of a\r\nriver on their left side, which, from its volume, they concluded\r\nmust be the principal source, and therefore they determined to\r\ntrace it.  They found it to be a most beautiful stream, averaging\r\ntwo and a half miles in width, evidently very deep, and with a\r\nfull, steady current.  After proceeding for several hours, they\r\nfound that the general placidity grew less, the smooth surface\r\noccasionally became ruffled by projecting rocks and rapids, and\r\nthe banks rose till the voyagers again found themselves in a\r\nravine or canon.\r\n\r\nDuring their sojourn on Jupiter they had had but little\r\nexperience with the tremendous winds that they knew, from reason\r\nand observation, must rage in its atmosphere.  They now heard\r\nthem whistling over their heads, and, notwithstanding the\r\nprotection afforded by the sides of the canon, occasionally\r\nreceived a gust that made the Callisto swerve.  They kept on\r\nsteadily, however, till sunset, at which time it became very dark\r\non account of the high banks, which rose as steeply as the\r\nPalisades on the Hudson to a height of nearly a thousand feet.\r\nFinding a small island near the eastern bank, they were glad to\r\nsecure the Callisto there for the night, below the reach of the\r\nwinds, which they, still heard singing loudly but with a musical\r\nnote in what seemed to them like the sky.\r\n\r\n"It is incomprehensible to me." said Ayrault, as they sat at\r\ndinner, "how the sun, at a distance of four hundred and\r\neighty-three million miles, can raise the amount of water we have\r\nhere passing us, and compared with which the discharge of the\r\ngreatest river on earth would be insignificant, to say nothing of\r\nthe stream we ascended before reaching this."\r\n\r\n"We must remember," replied Cortlandt, "that many of the\r\nconditions are different here from those that exist on earth.  We\r\nknow that some of the streams are warm, and even hot, and that\r\nthe temperature of Deepwaters Bay, and doubtless that of the\r\nocean also, is considerably higher than ours.  This would\r\nfacilitate evaporation.  The density of the atmosphere and the\r\ntremendous winds, of which I suspect we may see more later, must\r\nalso help the sun very much in its work of raising vapour.  But\r\nthe most potent factor is undoubtedly the vast size of the basin\r\nthat these rivers drain."\r\n\r\n"The great speed at which the atmospheric currents move," said\r\nBearwarden, "coupled with the comparative lowness of the mountain\r\nchains and the slight obstruction they offer to their passage,\r\nmust distribute the rain very thoroughly, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat unbroken area of the continents.  There can be no such\r\nstate of things here as exists in the western part of South\r\nAmerica, where the Andes are so high that any east-bound clouds,\r\nin crossing them, are shoved up so far into a cold region that\r\nall moisture they may have brought from the Pacific is condensed\r\ninto rain, with which parts of the western slope are deluged,\r\nwhile clouds from the Atlantic have come so far they have already\r\ndispersed their moisture, in consequence of which the region just\r\neast of the Andes gets little if any rain.  It is bad for a\r\ncontinent to have its high mountains near the ocean from which it\r\nshould get its rain, and good for it to have them set well back."\r\n\r\n"I should not be surprised," said Cortlandt, "if we saw another\r\nwaterfall to-morrow, though not in the shape of rain.  In the\r\nhour before we stopped we began to see rapids and protruding\r\nrocks.  That means that we are coming to a part of the channel\r\nthat is comparatively new, since the older parts have had time to\r\nwear smooth.  I take it, then, that we are near the foot of a\r\nretreating cascade, which we may hope soon to see.  That is\r\nexactly the order in which we found smooth water and rapids in\r\nriver No. 1, which we have named the Harlem."\r\n\r\nAfter this, not being tired, they used the remaining dark hours\r\nfor recording their recent adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                       HILLS AND VALLEYS.\r\n\r\nWith the first light they resumed their journey, and an hour\r\nafter setting out they sighted, as Cortlandt had predicted,\r\nanother cloud of vapour.  The fall--for such it proved to be--was\r\nmore beautiful than the other, for, though the volume of water\r\nwas not so great, it fell at one leap, without a break, and at\r\nthe same tremendous speed, a distance of more than a thousand\r\nfeet.  The canon rang with the echoes, while the spray flew in\r\nsheets against the smooth, glistening, sandstone walls.  Instead\r\nof coming from a river, as the first fall had, this poured at\r\nonce from the rocky lip, about two miles across, of a lake that\r\nwas eleven hundred feet above the surging mass in the vale below.\r\n\r\n"It is a thousand pities," said Bearwarden, "that this cataract\r\nhas got so near its source; for, at the rate these streams must\r\ncut, this one in a few hundred years, unless something is done to\r\nprevent it, will have worn back to the lake, and then good-bye to\r\nthe falls, which will become a series of rapids.  Perhaps the\r\nfirst effect will be merely to reduce by a few feet the height of\r\nthe falls, in which case they will remain in practically the same\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nAbout the shores of this lake they saw rhinoceroses with long\r\nthick wool, and herds of creatures that much resembled buffaloes.\r\n\r\n"I do not see," said Bearwarden, "why the identical species\r\nshould not exist here that till recently, in a geological sense,\r\ninhabited the earth.  The climate and all other conditions are\r\npractically the same on both planets, except a trifling\r\ndifference in weight, to which terrestrials would soon adapt\r\nthemselves.   We know by spectroscopic analysis that hydrogen,\r\niron, magnesium, and all our best-known substances exist in the\r\nsun, and even the stars, while the earth contains everything we\r\nhave found in meteorites.  Then why make an exception of life,\r\ninstead of supposing that at corresponding periods of development\r\nthe same living forms inhabit all?  It would be assuming the\r\neternal sterilization of the functions of Nature to suppose that\r\nour earth is the only body that can produce them."\r\n\r\n"The world of organic life is so much more complex," replied\r\nCortlandt, "than that of the crystal, that it requires great\r\ncontinuity.  So far we certainly have seen no men, or anything\r\nlike them, not even so much as a monkey, though I suppose,\r\naccording to your reasoning, Jupiter has not advanced far enough\r\nto produce even that."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," replied Bearwarden, "for it will require vast periods;\r\nand, according to my belief, at least half the earth\'s time of\r\nhabitability had passed before man appeared.  But we see Jupiter\r\nis admirably suited for those who have been developed somewhere\r\nelse, and it would be an awful shame if we allowed it to lie\r\nunimproved till it produces appreciative inhabitants of its own,\r\nfor we find more to admire in one half-hour than its entire\r\npresent population during its lifetime.  Yet, how magnificent\r\nthis world is, and how superior in its natural state to ours!\r\nThe mountainous horns of these crescent-shaped continents protect\r\nthem and the ocean they enclose from the cold polar marine\r\ncurrents, and in a measure from the icy winds; while the elevated\r\ncountry on the horns near the equator might be a Garden of Eden,\r\nor ideal resort.  To be sure, the continents might support a\r\nlarger population, if more broken up, notwithstanding the\r\nadvantage resulting from the comparatively low mountains along\r\nthe coasts, and the useful winds.  A greater subdivision of land\r\nand water, more great islands connected by isthmuses, and more\r\nmediterraneans joined by straits, would be a further advantage to\r\ncommerce; but with the sources of power at hand, the resistless\r\nwinds and water-power, much increased in effectiveness by their\r\nweight, the great tides when several moons are on the same side,\r\nor opposite the sun, internal heat near the surface, and abundant\r\ncoal-supply doubtless already formed and also near the surface,\r\nsuch small alterations could be made very easily, and would serve\r\nmerely to prevent our becoming rusty.\r\n\r\n"As Jupiter\'s distance from the sun varies from 506,563,000 miles\r\nat aphelion to only 460,013,000 at perihelion, this difference,\r\nin connection with even the slight inclination of the axis, must\r\nmake a slight change in seasons, but as the inclination is\r\npractically nothing, almost the entire change results from the\r\ndifference in distance.  This means that the rise or fall in\r\ntemperature is general on every degree of latitude, all being\r\nwarmed simultaneously, more or less, as the planet approaches or\r\ndeparts from the sun.  It means also that about the same\r\nconditions that Secretary Deepwaters suggested as desirable for\r\nthe earth, prevail here, and that Jupiter represents, therefore,\r\nabout the acme of climate naturally provided.  On account of its\r\nrapid rotation and vast size, the winds have a tornado\'s\r\nstrength, but they are nothing at this distance from the sun to\r\nwhat they would be if a planet with its present rate of rotation\r\nand size were where Venus or even the earth is.  In either of\r\nthese positions no land life with which we are acquainted could\r\nlive on the surface; for the slope of the atmospheric isobars--i.\r\ne., the lines of equal barometric pressure that produce wind by\r\nbecoming tilted through unequal expansion, after which the air,\r\nas it were, flows down-hill--would be too great.  The ascending\r\ncurrents about the equator would also, of course, be vastly\r\nstrengthened; so that we see a wise dispensation of Providence in\r\nplacing the large planets, which also rotate so rapidly, at a\r\ngreat distance from the sun, which is the father of all winds,\r\nrotation alone, however rapid, being unable to produce them."\r\n\r\nThey found this lake was about six times the size of Lake\r\nSuperior, and that several large and small streams ran into its\r\nupper end.  These had their sources in smaller lakes that were at\r\nslightly higher elevations.  Though the air was cool, the sun\r\nshone brightly, while the ground was covered with flowers\r\nresembling those of the northern climes on earth, of all shapes\r\nand lines.  Twice a day these sent up their song, and trees were\r\ncovered with buds, and the birds twittered gaily.  The streams\r\nmurmured and bubbled, and all things reminded the travellers of\r\nearly morning in spring.\r\n\r\n"If anything could reconcile me," said Bearwarden, "to exchange\r\nmy active utilitarian life for a rustic poetical existence, it\r\nwould be this place, for it is far more beautiful than anything I\r\nhave seen on earth.  It needs but a Maud Muller and a few cows to\r\ncomplete the picture, since Nature gives us a vision of eternal\r\npeace and repose."\r\n\r\nSomehow the mention of Maud Muller, and the delicate and refined\r\nflowers, whose perfume he inhaled, brought up thoughts that were\r\nnever far below the surface in Ayrault\'s mind.  "The place is\r\nheavenly enough," said he, "to make one wish to live and remain\r\nhere forever, but to me it would be Hamlet with Hamlet left out."\r\n\r\n"Ah! poor chap," said Cortlandt, "you are in love, but you are\r\nnot to be pitied, for though the thrusts at the heart are sharp,\r\nthey may be the sweetest that mortals know."\r\n\r\nThe following morning they reluctantly left the picturesque\r\nshores of Lake Serenity, with their beautiful tints and foliage,\r\nand resumed the journey, to explore a number of islands in the\r\nocean in the west, which were recorded on their negatives.\r\nAscending to rarefied air, they saw great chains of mountains,\r\nwhich they imagined ran parallel to the coast, rising to\r\nconsiderable altitudes in the east.  The tops of all glistened\r\nwith a mantle of snow in the sunlight, while between the ridges\r\nthey saw darker and evidently fertile valleys.  They passed,\r\nmoving northwest, over large and small lakes, all evidently part\r\nof the same great system, and continued to sweep along for\r\nseveral days with a beautiful panorama, as varying as a\r\nkaleidoscope, spread beneath their eyes.  They observed that the\r\ncharacter of the country gradually changed.  The symmetrically\r\nrounded mountains and hills began to show angles, while great\r\nslabs of rock were split from the faces.  The sides also became\r\nless vertical, and there was an accumulation of detrital\r\nfragments about their bases.  These heaps of fractured stone had\r\nin some cases begun to disintegrate and form soil, on which there\r\nwas a scant growth of vegetation; but the sides and summits,\r\nwhose jaggedness increased with their height, were absolutely\r\nbare.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Cortlandt, "we have unmistakable evidence of frost\r\nand ice action.  The next interesting question is, How recently\r\nhas denudation occurred?  The absence of plant life at the\r\nexposed places," he continued, as if lecturing to a class, "can\r\nbe accounted for here, as nearer the equator, by the violence of\r\nthe wind; but I greatly doubt whether water will now freeze in\r\nthis latitude at any season of the year, for, even should the\r\nNorthern hemisphere\'s very insignificant winter coincide with the\r\nplanet\'s aphelion, the necessary drop from the present\r\ntemperature would be too great to be at all probable.  If, then,\r\nit is granted that ice does not form here now, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that it has done so, the most plausible conclusion is\r\nthat the inclination of Jupiter\'s axis is automatically changing,\r\nas we know the earth\'s has often done.  There being nothing\r\nincompatible in this view with the evidence at hand, we can\r\nsafely assume it correct for the time being at least.  When\r\nfarther south, you remember, we found no trace of ice action,\r\nnotwithstanding the comparative slowness with which we decided\r\nthat the ridges in the crust had been upheaved on account of the\r\nresisting power of gravity, and, as I see now, also on account of\r\nJupiter\'s great mass, which must prevent its losing its heat\r\nanything like as fast as the earth has, in which I think also we\r\nhave the explanation of the comparatively low elevation of the\r\nmountains that we found we could not account for by the power of\r\ngravitation alone.[2]  From the fact that the exposed surface\r\nfarther south must be old, on account of the slow upheaval and\r\nthe slight wear to which it is exposed, about the only wearing\r\nagent being the wind, which would be powerless to erase\r\nice-scratches, especially since, on account of gravity\'s power,\r\nit cannot, like our desert winds, carry much sand--which, as we\r\nknow, has cut away the base of the Sphinx--I think it is logical\r\nto conclude that, though Jupiter\'s axis is changing naturally as\r\nthe earth\'s has been, it has never varied as much as twenty-three\r\nand a half degrees, and certainly to nothing like the extent to\r\nwhich we see Venus and Uranus tilted to-day."\r\n\r\n[2]  It is well known that mountain chains are but ridges or\r\nfoldings in the crust upheaved as the interior cools and shrinks.\r\nThis is proved by reason and by experiments with viscous clay or\r\nother material placed upon a sheet of stretched rubber, which is\r\nafterwards allowed to contract, whereupon the analogues of\r\nmountain ridges are thrown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I follow you," said Bearwarden, "and do not see how we could\r\narrive at anything else.  From Jupiter\'s low specific gravity,\r\nweighing but little more than an equal bulk of water, I should\r\nsay the interior must be very hot, or else is composed of light\r\nmaterial, for the crust\'s surface, or the part we see, is\r\nevidently about as dense as what we have on earth.  These things\r\nhave puzzled me a good deal, and I have been wondering if Jupiter\r\nmay not have been formed before the earth and the smaller\r\nplanets."\r\n\r\n"The discrepancies between even the best authorities," replied\r\nCortlandt, "show that as yet but little has been discovered from\r\nthe earth concerning Jupiter\'s real condition.  The two theories\r\nthat try to account for its genesis are the ring theory and the\r\nnebulous.  We know that the sun is constantly emitting vast\r\nvolumes of heat and light, and that, with the exception of the\r\nheat resulting from the impact of falling meteors, it receives\r\nnone from outside, the principal source being the tremendous\r\nfriction and pressure between the cooling and shrinking strata\r\nwithin the great mass of the sun itself.  A seeming paradox\r\ntherefore comes in here, which must be considered:  If the sun\r\nwere composed entirely of gas, it would for a time continue to\r\ngrow hotter; but the sun is incessantly radiating light and heat,\r\nand consequently becoming smaller.  Therefore the farther back we\r\ngo the hotter we find the sun, and also the larger, till, instead\r\nof having a diameter of eight hundred and eighty thousand miles,\r\nit filled the space now occupied by the entire solar system.\r\nHere is where the two theories start.  According to the first,\r\nthe revolving nebulous mass threw off a ring that became the\r\nplanet Neptune, afterwards another that contained the material\r\nfor Uranus, and so on, the lightest substance in the sun being\r\nthrown off first, by which they accounted for the lightness of\r\nthe four great planets, and finally Mars, the earth, and the\r\nsmall dense planets near the sun.  The advocates of this theory\r\npointed to Saturn\'s rings as an illustration of the birth of a\r\nplanet, or, rather, in that case a satellite.  According to this,\r\nthe major planets have had a far longer separate existence than\r\nthe minor, which would account for their being so advanced\r\nnotwithstanding their size.  This theory may again come into\r\ngeneral acceptance, but for the present it has been discredited\r\nby the nebulous.  According to this second theory, at the time\r\nthe sun filled all the space inside of Neptune\'s, orbit, or\r\nextended even farther, several centres of condensation were\r\nformed within the nebulous, gaseous mass.  The greatest centre\r\nbecame the sun, and the others, large and small, the planets,\r\nwhich--as a result of the spiral motion of the whole, such as is\r\nnow going on before our eyes in the great nebulae of fifty- one\r\nM. Canuin venaticorum, and many others--began to revolve about\r\nthe greatest central body of gas.  As the separate masses cooled,\r\nthey shrank, and their surfaces or extreme edges, which at first\r\nwere contiguous, began to recede, which recession is still going\r\non with some rapidity on the part of the sun, for we may be sure\r\nits diameter diminishes as its density increases.  According to\r\neither theory, as I see it, the major planets, on account of\r\ntheir distance from the central mass, have had longer separate\r\nexistences than the minor, and are therefore more advanced than\r\nthey would be had all been formed at the same time.\r\n\r\n"This theory explains the practical uniformity in the chemical\r\ncomposition of all members of this system by assuming that they\r\nwere all once a part of the same body, and you may say brothers\r\nand sisters of the sun, instead of its offspring.  It also makes\r\nsize the only factor determining temperature and density, but of\r\ncourse modified by age, since otherwise Jupiter would have a far\r\nless developed crust than that with which we find it.  I have\r\nalways considered the period from the molten condition to that\r\nwith a crust as comparatively short, which stands to reason, for\r\nradiation has then no check; and the period from the formation of\r\nthe crust, which acts as a blanket, to the death of a planet, as\r\nvery long.  I have not found this view clearly set forth in any\r\nof the books I have read, but it seems to me the simplest and\r\nmost natural explanation.  Now, granted that the solar system was\r\nonce a nebula, on which I think every one will agree--the same\r\nforces that changed it into a system of sun and planets must be\r\nat work on fifty-one M. Canum venaticorum, Andromeda, and ninety-\r\nnine M. Virginis, and must inevitably change them to suns, each\r\nwith doubtless a system of planets.\r\n\r\n"If, then, the condition of a nebula or star depends simply on\r\nits size, it is reasonable to suppose that Andromeda, Sirius, and\r\nall the vast bodies we see, were created at the same time as our\r\nsystem, which involves the necessity of one general and\r\nsimultaneous creation day.  But as Sirius, with its diameter of\r\ntwelve million miles, must be larger than some of the nebulae\r\nwill be when equally condensed, we must suppose rather that\r\nnebulae are forming and coming into the condition of bright and\r\ndead stars, much as apples or pears on a fruit tree are\r\nconstantly growing and developing, so that the Mosaic description\r\nof the creation would probably apply in point of time only to our\r\nsystem, or perhaps to our globe, though the rest will doubtless\r\npass through precisely the same stages.  This, I think, I will\r\npublish, on our return, as the Cortlandt astronomical doctrine,\r\nas the most rational I have seen devised, and one that I think we\r\nmay safely believe, until, perhaps, through increased knowledge,\r\nit can be disproved."\r\n\r\nAfter they crossed a line of hills that ran at right angles to\r\ntheir course they found the country more rolling.  All streams\r\nand water-courses flowed in their direction, while their aneroid\r\nshowed them that they were gradually descending.  When they were\r\nmoving along near the surface of the ground, a delicious and\r\nrefined perfume exhaled by the blue and white flowers, that had\r\nbeen growing smaller as they journeyed northward, frequently\r\nreached their nostrils.  To Cortlandt and Bearwarden it was\r\nmerely the scent of a flower, but to Ayrault it recalled mental\r\npictures of Sylvia wearing violets and lilies that he had given\r\nher.  He knew that the greatest telescopes on earth could not\r\nreveal the Callisto moving about in Jupiter\'s sunshine, as even a\r\npoint of light, at that distance, and, notwithstanding\r\nCortlandt\'s learning and Bearwarden\'s joviality, he felt at times\r\nextremely lonely.\r\n\r\nThey swept along steadily for fifty hours, having bright sunny\r\ndays and beautifully moonlit nights.  They passed over finely\r\nrounded hills and valleys and well- watered plains.  As they\r\napproached the ocean and its level the temperature rose, and\r\nthere was more moisture in the air.  The plants and flowers also\r\nincreased in size, again resembling somewhat the large species\r\nthey had seen near the equator.\r\n\r\n"This would be the place to live," said Bearwarden, looking at\r\niron mountains, silver, copper, and lead formations, primeval\r\nforests, rich prairies, and regions evidently underlaid with coal\r\nand petroleum, not to mention huge beds of aluminum clay, and\r\nother natural resources, that made his materialistic mouth water.\r\n"It would be joy and delight to develop industries here, with no\r\nsnow avalanches to clog your railroads, or icy blizzards to\r\nparalyze work, nor weather that blights you with sun-strokes and\r\nfevers.  On our return to the earth we must organize a company to\r\nrun regular interplanetary lines.  We could start on this globe\r\nall that is best on our own.  Think what boundless possibilities\r\nmay be before the human race on this planet, which on account of\r\nits vast size will be in its prime when our insignificant earth\r\nis cold and dead and no longer capable of supporting life!  Think\r\nalso of the indescribable blessing to the congested communities\r\nof Europe and America, to find an unlimited outlet here!  Mars is\r\nalready past its prime, and Venus scarcely habitable, but in\r\nJupiter we have a new promised land, compared with which our\r\nearth is a pygmy, or but little more than microscopic."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Ayrault, "that the possibilities here have no\r\nlimit; but I do not see how you can compare it to the promised\r\nland, since, till we undertook this journey, no one had even\r\nthought of Jupiter as a habitable place."\r\n\r\n "I trace the Divine promise," replied Bearwarden, "in what you\r\ndescribed to us on earth as man\'s innate longing and desire to\r\nrise, and in the fact that the Almighty has given the race\r\nunbounded expansiveness in very limited space.  This would look\r\nto me as the return of man to the garden of Eden through\r\nintellectual development, for here every man can sit under his\r\nown vine and fig-tree."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Cortlandt, "that no paradise or heaven\r\ndescribed in anything but the Bible compares with this.\r\nAccording to Virgil\'s description, the joys on the banks of his\r\nriver Lethe must have been most sad and dreary, the general\r\nidleness and monotony apparently being broken only by wrestling\r\nmatches between the children, while the rest strolled about with\r\nlaurel wreaths or rested in the shade.  The pilot Palinurus, who\r\nhad been drowned by falling overboard while asleep, but who\r\nbefore that had presumably done his duty, did not seem especially\r\nhappy; while the harsh, resentful disposition evidently remained\r\nunsoftened, for Dido became like a cliff of Marpesian marble when\r\nAEneas asked to be forgiven, though he had doubtless considered\r\nhimself in duty bound to leave her, having been twice commanded\r\nto do so by Mercury, the messenger of Jove.  She, like the rest,\r\nseems to have had no occupation, while the consciences of few\r\nappear to have been sufficiently clear to enable them to enjoy\r\nunbroken rest."\r\n\r\n"The idleness in the spirit-land of all profane writers," added\r\nBearwarden, "has often surprised me too.  Though I have always\r\nrecommended a certain amount of recreation for my staff--in fact,\r\nmore than I have generally had myself--an excess of it becomes a\r\nbore.  I think that all real progress comes through thorough\r\nwork.  Why should we assume that progress ceases at death?  I\r\nbelieve in the verse that says, \'We learn here on earth those\r\nthings the knowledge of which is perfected in heaven.\'"\r\n\r\n"According to that," said Cortlandt, "you will some day be\r\nsetting the axis of heaven right, for in order to do work there\r\nmust be work to be done--a necessary corollary to which is that\r\nheaven is still imperfect."\r\n\r\n"No," said Bearwarden, bristling up at the way Cortlandt\r\nsometimes received his speeches, "it means simply that its\r\ndevelopment, though perfect so far as it goes, may not be\r\nfinished, and that we may be the means, as on earth, of helping\r\nit along."\r\n\r\n"The conditions constituting heaven," said Ayrault, "may be as\r\nfixed as the laws of Nature, though the products of those\r\nconditions might, it seems to me, still be forming and subject to\r\nmodification thereby.  The reductio ad absurdu would of course\r\napply if we supposed the work of creation absolutely finished."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                    NORTH-POLAR DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on the western horizon, they beheld the ocean.\r\nMany of the streams whose sources they had seen when they crossed\r\nthe divide from the lake basin, and whose courses they had\r\nfollowed, were now rivers a mile wide, with the tide ebbing and\r\nrising within them many hundreds of miles from their mouths.\r\nWhen they reached the shore line they found the waves breaking,\r\nas on earth, upon the sands, but with this difference: they had\r\nbefore noted the smallness of the undulations compared with the\r\nstrength of the wind, the result of the water\'s weight.  These\r\nwaves now reminded them of the behaviour of mercury, or of melted\r\nlead when stirred on earth, by the rapidity with which the crests\r\ndropped.  Though the wind was blowing an on-shore gale, there was\r\nbut little combing, and when there was any it lasted but a\r\nsecond.  The one effort of the crests and waves seemed to be to\r\nremain at rest, or, if stirred in spite of themselves, to\r\nsubside.\r\n\r\nWhen over the surface of the ocean, the voyagers rose to a height\r\nof thirty thousand metres, and after twenty- four hours\'\r\ntravelling saw, at a distance of about two hundred miles, what\r\nlooked like another continent, but which they knew must be an\r\nisland.  On finding themselves above it, they rose still higher\r\nto obtain a view of its outlines and compare its shape with that\r\nof the islands in the photographs they had had time to develop.\r\nThe length ran from southeast to northwest.  Though crossed by\r\nlatitude forty, and notwithstanding Jupiter\'s distance from the\r\nsun, the southern side had a very luxuriant vegetation that was\r\nalmost semi-tropical.       This they accounted for by its total\r\nimmunity from cold, the density of the air at sea-level, and the\r\nwarm moist breezes it received from the tepid ocean.  The climate\r\nwas about the same as that of the Riviera or of Florida in\r\nwinter, and there was, of course, no parching summer.\r\n\r\n"This shows me," said Bearwarden, "that a country\'s climate\r\ndepends less on the amount of heat it receives from the sun than\r\non the amount it retains; proof of which we have in the tops of\r\nthe Himalayas perpetually covered with snow, and snow-capped\r\nmountains on the very equator, where they get the most direct\r\nrays, and where those rays have but little air to penetrate.  It\r\nshows that the presence of a substantial atmosphere is as\r\nnecessary a part of the calculation in practice as the sun\r\nitself.  I am inclined to think that, with the constant effect of\r\nthe internal heat on its oceans and atmosphere, Jupiter could get\r\nalong with a good deal less solar heat than it receives, in proof\r\nof which I expect to find the poles themselves quite comfortable.\r\nThe reason the internal heat is so little taken into account on\r\nearth is because, from the thickness of the crust, it cannot make\r\nitself felt; for if the earth were as chilled through as ice, the\r\npeople on the surface would not feel the difference."\r\n\r\nA Jovian week\'s explorations disclosed the fact that though the\r\nisland\'s general outlines were fairly regular, it had deep-water\r\nharbours, great rivers, and land-locked gulfs and bays, some of\r\nwhich penetrated many hundred miles into the interior.  It also\r\nshowed that the island\'s length was about six thousand miles, and\r\nits breadth about three thousand, and that it had therefore about\r\nthe superficial area of Asia.  They found no trace of the great\r\nmonsters that had been so numerous on the mainland, though there\r\nwere plenty of smaller and gentle-looking creatures, among them\r\nanimals whose build was much like that of the prehistoric horse,\r\nwith undeveloped toes on each side of the hoof, which in the\r\nmodern terrestrial horse have disappeared, the hoof being in\r\nreality but a rounded-off middle finger.\r\n\r\n   "It is wonderful," said Bearwarden, "how comparatively narrow\r\na body of water can keep different species entirely separate.\r\nThe island of Sumatra, for instance, is inhabited by marsupials\r\nbelonging to the distinct Australian type, in which the female,\r\nas in the kangaroo, carries the slightly developed young in a\r\npouch; while the Malay peninsula, joined to the mainland, has all\r\nthe highly developed animals of Asia and the connected land of\r\nthe Eastern hemisphere, the narrow Malacca Strait being all that\r\nhas kept marsupials and mammals apart, though the separating\r\npower has been increased by the rapid current setting through.\r\nThis has decreased the chance of creatures carried to sea on\r\ndrift-wood or uprooted trees getting safely over to such a degree\r\nthat apparently none have survived; for, had they done so, we may\r\nbe certain that the mammals, with the advantage their young have\r\nover the marsupials, would soon have run them out, the marsupials\r\nbeing the older and the less perfect form of life of the two."\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the beautiful sea-girt region beneath them,\r\nCortlandt proposed that it be named after their host, which\r\nBearwarden seconded, whereupon they entered it as Ayrault Island\r\non the charts.  After this they rose to a great height, and flew\r\nswiftly over three thousand miles of ocean till they came to\r\nanother island not quite as large as the first.  It was four\r\nthousand five hundred miles long by something less than three\r\nthousand wide, and was therefore about the size of Africa.  It\r\nhad several high ranges of mountains and a number of great rivers\r\nand fine harbours, while murmuring, bubbling brooks flowed\r\nthrough its forest glades.  There were active volcanoes along the\r\nnorthern coast, and the blue, crimson, and purple lines in the\r\nluxuriant foliage were the most beautiful they had ever seen.\r\n\r\n"I propose," said Bearwarden, "that we christen this Sylvialand."\r\nThis Cortlandt immediately seconded, and it was so entered on the\r\ncharts.\r\n\r\n"These two islands," said Bearwarden, "may become the centres of\r\ncivilization.  With flying machines and cables to carry\r\npassengers and information, and ships of great displacement for\r\nthe interchange of commodities, there is no limit to their\r\npossible development.  The absence of large waves will also be\r\nvery favourable to sea-spiders, which will be able to run at\r\ntremendous speeds.  The constancy in the eruptions of the\r\nvolcanoes will offer a great field to Jovian inventors, who will\r\nunquestionably be able to utilize their heat for the production\r\nof steam or electricity, to say nothing of an inexhaustible\r\nsupply of valuable chemicals.  They may contain the means of\r\nproducing some force entirely different from apergy, and as\r\nsuperior to electricity as that is to steam.  Our earthly\r\nvolcanoes have been put to slight account because of the long\r\nintervals between eruptions."\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Sylvialand they went westward to the eastern of the\r\ntwo crescent continents.  It was separated from the island by\r\nabout six thousand miles of ocean, and had less width than the\r\nwestern, having about the proportions of a three-day crescent,\r\nwhile the western had the shape of the moon when four or five\r\ndays old.  They found the height of the mountains and plateaus\r\nsomewhat less than on the eastern continent, but no great\r\ndifference in other respects, except that, as they went towards\r\nthe pole, the vegetation became more like that of Scotland or a\r\nnorth temperate region than any they had seen.  On reaching\r\nlatitude fifty they again came out over the ocean to investigate\r\nthe speckled condition they had observed there.  They found a\r\nvast archipelago covering as great an area as the whole Pacific\r\nOcean.  The islands varied from the size of Borneo and Madagascar\r\nto that of Sicily and Corsica, while some contained but a few\r\nsquare miles.  The surface of the archipelago was about equally\r\ndivided between land and water.\r\n\r\n"It would take good navigation or an elaborate system of\r\nlight-houses," said Bearwarden, "for a captain to find the\r\nshortest course through these groups."\r\n\r\nThe islands were covered with shade trees much resembling those\r\non earth, and the leaves on many were turning yellow and red, for\r\nthis hemisphere\'s autumn had already begun.\r\n\r\n"The Jovian trees," said Cortlandt, "can never cease to bear,\r\nthough the change of seasons is evidently able to turn their\r\ncolour, perhaps by merely ripening them.  When a ripe leaf falls\r\noff, its place is doubtless soon taken by a bud, for germination\r\nand fructification go on side by side."\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, they decided to name this Twentieth Century\r\nArchipelago, since so much of the knowledge appertaining to it\r\nhad been acquired in their own day.  At latitude sixty the\r\nnorthern arms of the two continents came within fifteen hundred\r\nmiles of each other.  The eastern extension was split like the\r\ntail of a fish, the great bay formed thereby being filled with\r\nislands, which also extended about half of the distance across.\r\nThe western extremity shelved very gradually, the sand-bars\r\nrunning out for miles just below the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nAfter this the travellers flew northward at great speed in the\r\nupper regions of the air, for they were anxious to hasten their\r\njourney.  They found nothing but unbroken sea, and not till they\r\nreached latitude eighty-seven was there a sign of ice.  They then\r\nsaw some small bergs and field ice, but in no great quantities.\r\nAs their outside thermometer, when just above the placid\r\nwater--for there were no waves here--registered twenty- one\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, they accounted for this scarcity of ice by\r\nthe absence of land on which fresh water could freeze, and by the\r\nfact that it was not cold enough to congeal the very salt\r\nsea-water.\r\n\r\nFinally they reached another archipelago a few hundred miles in\r\nextent, the larger islands of which were covered with a sheet of\r\nice, at the edges of which small icebergs were being formed by\r\nbreaking off and slowly floating.  Finding a small island on\r\nwhich the coating was thin, they grounded the Callisto, and\r\nstepped out for the first time in several days.  The air was so\r\nstill that a small piece of paper released at a height of six\r\nfeet sank slowly and went as straight as the string of a\r\nplumb-line.  The sun was bisected by the line of the horizon, and\r\nappeared to be moving about them in a circle, with only its upper\r\nhalf visible.  As Jupiter\'s northern hemisphere was passing\r\nthrough its autumnal equinox, they concluded they had landed\r\nexactly at the pole.\r\n\r\n"Now to work on our experiment," said Cortlandt. "I wonder how we\r\nmay best get below the frozen surface?"\r\n\r\n"We can explode a small quantity of dynamite," replied\r\nBearwarden, "after which the digging will be comparatively easy."\r\n\r\nWhile Cortlandt and Bearwarden prepared the mine, Ayrault brought\r\nout a pickaxe, two shovels, and the battery and wires with which\r\nto ignite the explosive.  They made their preparations within one\r\nhundred feet of the Callisto, or much nearer than an equivalent\r\namount of gunpowder could have been discharged.\r\n\r\n"This recalls an old laboratory experiment, or rather lecture,"\r\nsaid Cortlandt, as they completed the arrangements, "for the\r\nillustration is not as a rule carried out.  Explode two pounds of\r\npowder on an iron safe in a room with the windows closed, and the\r\nwindows will be blown out, while the safe remains uninjured.\r\nExplode an equivalent amount of dynamite on top of the safe, and\r\nit will be destroyed, while the glass panes are not even cracked.\r\nThis illustrates the difference in rapidity with which the\r\nexplosions take place.  To the intensely rapid action of dynamite\r\nthe air affords as much resistance as a solid substance, while\r\nthe explosion of the powder is so slow that the air has time to\r\nmove away; hence the destruction of the windows in the first\r\ncase, and the safe in the second."\r\n\r\nWhen they had moved beyond the danger line, Bearwarden, as the\r\nparty\'s practising engineer, pressed the button, and the\r\nexplosion did the rest.  They found that the ground was frozen to\r\na depth of but little more than a foot, below which it became\r\nperceptibly warm.  Plying their shovels vigorously, they had soon\r\ndug the hole so deep that its edges were above their heads.  When\r\nthe floor was ten feet below the surrounding level the\r\nthermometer registered sixty.\r\n\r\n"This is scarcely a fair test," said Cortlandt, "since the heat\r\nrises and is lost as fast as given off.  Let us therefore close\r\nthe opening and see in what time it will melt a number of cubic\r\nfeet of ice."\r\n\r\nAccordingly they climbed out, threw in about a cart-load of ice,\r\nand covered the opening with two of the Callisto\'s thick rugs.\r\nIn half an hour all the ice had melted, and in another half hour\r\nthe water was hot.\r\n\r\n"No arctic expedition need freeze to death here," said\r\nBearwarden, "since all a man would have to do would be to burrow\r\na few feet to be as warm as toast."\r\n\r\nAs the island on which they had landed was at one side of the\r\narchipelago, but was itself at the exact pole, it followed that\r\nthe centre of the archipelago was not the part farthest north.\r\nThis in a measure accounted for the slight thickness of ice and\r\nsnow, for the isobaric lines would slope, and consequently what\r\nwind there was would flow towards the interior of the\r\narchipelago, whose surface was colder than the surrounding ocean.\r\nThe moist air, however, coming almost entirely from the south,\r\nwould lose most of its moisture by condensation in passing over\r\nthe ice-laden land, and so, like the clouds over the region east\r\nof the Andes, would have but little left to let fall on this\r\nextreme northern part.  The blanketing effect of a great\r\nthickness of snow would also cause, the lower strata of ice to\r\nmelt, by keeping in the heat constantly given off by the warm\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n"I think there can be no question," said Cortlandt, "that, as a\r\nresult of Jupiter\'s great flattening at the poles and the drawing\r\nof the crust, which moves faster in Jupiter\'s rotation than any\r\nother part, towards the equator, the crust must be particularly\r\nthin here; for, were it as thin all over, there would be no space\r\nfor the coal-beds, which, judging from the purity of the\r\natmosphere, must be very extensive.  Further, we can recall that\r\nthe water in the hot spring near which we alighted, which\r\nevidently came from a far greater depth than we have here, was\r\nnot as hot as this.  The conclusion is clear that elsewhere the\r\ninternal heat is not as near the surface as here."\r\n\r\n"The more I see of Jupiter," exclaimed Bearwarden\r\nenthusiastically, "the more charmed I become.  It almost exactly\r\nsupplies what I have been conjuring up as my idea of a perfect\r\nplanet.  Its compensations of high land near the equator, and low\r\nwith effective internal heat at the poles, are ideal. The gradual\r\nslope of its continental elevations, on account of their extent,\r\nwill ease the work of operating railways, and the atmosphere\'s\r\ndensity will be just the thing for our flying machines, while\r\nNature has supplied all sources of power so lavishly that no\r\nundertaking will be too great.  Though land as yet, to judge by\r\nour photographs, occupies only about one eighth of the surface,\r\nwe know, from the experience of the other planets, that this is\r\nbound to increase; so that, if the human race can perpetuate\r\nitself on Jupiter long enough, it will undoubtedly have one\r\nfourth or a larger proportion for occupation, though the land\r\nalready upheaved comprises fully forty times the area of our\r\nentire globe, which, as we know, is still three-fourths water."\r\n\r\n"Since we have reached what we might call the end of Jupiter, and\r\nstill have time, continued Ayrault, "let us proceed to Saturn,\r\nwhere we may find even stranger things than here.  I hoped we\r\ncould investigate the great red spot, but am convinced we have\r\nseen the beginning of one in Twentieth Century Archipelago, and\r\nwhat, under favourable conditions, will be recognized as such on\r\nearth."\r\n\r\nIt was just six terrestrial weeks since they had set out, and\r\ntherefore February 2d on earth.\r\n\r\n"It would be best, in any case, to start from Jupiter\'s equator,"\r\nsaid Cortlandt, "for the straight line we should make from the\r\nsurface here would be at right angles to Saturn.  We shall\r\nprobably, in spite of ourselves, swing a few degrees beyond the\r\nline, and so can get a bird\'s-eye view of some portion of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere."\r\n\r\n"All aboard for Saturn!" cried Bearwarden enthusiastically, in\r\nhis jovial way.  "This will be a journey."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                        THE SCENE SHIFTS.\r\n\r\nHaving returned the rugs to the Callisto, they applied the\r\nmaximum power of the batteries to rising, closed all openings\r\nwhen the barometer registered thirty, and moved off into space.\r\nWhen Several thousand miles above the pole, they diverted part of\r\nthe power to attracting the nearest moon that was in the plane of\r\nJupiter\'s equator, and by the time their upward motion had ceased\r\nwere moving well in its direction.  Their rapid motion aided the\r\nwork of resisting gravity, since their car had in fact become a\r\nsmall moon, revolving, like those of Uranus or that of Neptune,\r\nin an orbit varying greatly from the plane of the ecliptic.  As\r\nthey flew south at a height ranging from two thousand to three\r\nthousand miles, the planet revolved before them, and they had a\r\nchance of obtaining a thorough view.  There were but a few\r\nscattered islands on the side of the Northern hemisphere opposite\r\nto that over which they had reached the pole, and in the varying\r\ncolours of the water, which they attributed to temperature or to\r\nsome substance in solution, they recognized what they had always\r\nheard described on earth as the bands of Jupiter, encircling the\r\nplanet with great belts, the colour varying with the latitude.\r\nAt about latitude forty-five these bands were purple, farther\r\nsouth light olive green, and at the equator a brown orange.\r\nShortly after they swung across the equator the ocean again\r\nbecame purple, and at the same time a well-defined and very\r\nbrilliant white spot came into view.  Its brightness showed\r\nslight variations in intensity, though its general shape remained\r\nunchanged.  It had another peculiarity, in that it possessed a\r\nfairly rapid motion of its own, as it moved eastward across the\r\nsurface of the ocean.  It exhibited all the phenomena of the\r\nstorm they had watched in crossing Secretary Deepwaters Bay, but\r\ncovered a larger area, and was far more violent.  Their glasses\r\nshowed them vast sheets of spray driven along at tremendous\r\nspeed, while the surface was milky white.\r\n\r\n"This," said Bearwarden, picking up a book, "solves to my mind\r\nthe mystery of the white spot described by the English writer\r\nChambers, in 1889, as follows:\r\n\r\n"\'During the last few years a brilliant white spot has been\r\nvisible on the equatorial border of the great southern belt.  A\r\ncurious fact in connection with this spot is, that it moves with\r\na velocity of some two hundred and sixty miles per hour greater\r\nthan the red spot.  Denning obtained one hundred and sixty-nine\r\nobservations of this bright marking during the years 1880-1883,\r\nand determined the period as nine hours, fifty minutes, eight and\r\nseven tenths seconds (five and a half minutes less than that of\r\nthe red spot).  Although the latter is now somewhat faint, the\r\nwhite spot gives promise of remaining visible for many years.\r\nDuring the year 1886 a large number of observations of Jupiter\r\nwere made at the Dearborn Observatory, Chicago, U. S., by Prof.\r\nG. W. Hough, using the eighteen-and-a-half-inch refractor of the\r\nobservatory.  Inasmuch as these observations are not only of high\r\nintrinsic interest, but are in conflict, to some extent, with\r\nprevious records, a somewhat full abstract of them will be\r\nuseful:  The object of general interest was the great red spot.\r\nThe outline, shape, and size of this remarkable object has\r\nremained without material change from the year 1879, when it  was\r\nfirst observed here, until the present time.  According to our\r\nobservations, during the whole of this period it has shown a\r\nsharp and well-defined outline, and at no time has it coalesced\r\nor been joined to any belt in its proximity, as has been alleged\r\nby some observers.  During the year 1885 the middle of the spot\r\nwas very much paler in colour than the margins, causing it to\r\nappear as an elliptical ring.  The ring form has continued up to\r\nthe present time.  While the outline of the spot has remained\r\nvery constant, the colour has changed materially from year to\r\nyear.  During the past three years (1884- \'86) it has at times\r\nbeen very faint, so as barely to be visible.  The persistence of\r\nthis object for so many years leads me to infer that the formerly\r\naccepted theory, that the phenomena seen on the surface of the\r\nplanet are atmospheric, is no longer tenable.  The statement so\r\noften made in text-books, that in the course of a few days or\r\nmonths the whole aspect of the planet may be changed, is\r\nobviously erroneous.  The oval white spots on the southern\r\nhemisphere of the planet, nine degrees south of the equator, have\r\nbeen systematically observed at every opposition during the past\r\neight years.  They are generally found in groups of three or\r\nmore, but are rather difficult to observe.  The rotation period\r\ndeduced from them is nearly the same as from the great red spot.\r\nThese spots usually have a slow drift in longitude of about five\r\nseconds daily in the direction of the planet\'s rotation, when\r\nreferred to the great red spot; corresponding to a rotation\r\nperiod of twenty seconds less than the latter.\'\r\n\r\n"This shows," continued Bearwarden, "that as long ago as towards\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century the old idea that we saw\r\nnothing but the clouds in Jupiter\'s atmosphere was beginning to\r\nchange; and also how closely the two English writers and Prof.\r\nHough were studying the subject, though their views did not\r\nentirely agree.  A white spot is merely a storm-centre passing\r\nround and round the planet, the wind running a little ahead of\r\nthe surface, which accounts for its rapid rotation compared with\r\nthe red spot, which is a fixture.  A critic may say we have no\r\nsuch winds on earth; to which I reply, that winds on a planet of\r\nJupiter\'s size, with its rate of rotation--though it is\r\n480,000,000 miles from the sun and the internal heat is so near\r\nthe surface--and with land and water arranged as they are, may\r\nand indeed must be very different from those prevailing on earth,\r\nthe conditions producing and affecting them being so changed.\r\nThough the storm-centre moves two hundred and sixty miles an\r\nhour, the wind need not blow at that rate."\r\n\r\nLater they saw several smaller spots drifting eastward, but\r\nconcluded that any seaworthy ship might pass safely through them,\r\nfor, though they were hurricanes of great violence, the waves\r\nwere small.\r\n\r\n"There would be less danger," said Bearwarden, "of shipping seas\r\nhere than there is on earth; the principal risk to travellers\r\nwould be that of being blown from the deck.  On account of the\r\nair\'s weight in connection with its velocity, this would\r\nnecessitate some precaution."\r\n\r\nThe next object of interest was the great red spot.  It proved,\r\nas Cortlandt had predicted, to be a continent, with at that time\r\nno special colour, though they easily recognized it by comparing\r\nits outlines with those of the spot in the map.  Its length, as\r\nthey already knew, was twenty-seven thousand miles, and its\r\nbreadth about eight thousand miles, so that it contained more\r\nsquare miles than the entire surface of the earth, land and water\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n"It is clear," said Cortlandt, "that at some season of Jupiter\'s\r\nlong year a change takes place that affects the colour of the\r\nleaves--some drought or prolonged norther; for it is obvious that\r\nthat is the simplest explanation.  In like manner we may expect\r\nthat at some times more white spots will move across the ocean\r\nthan at others."\r\n\r\n"On account of the size of these continents and oceans," said\r\nBearwarden, "it is easy to believe that many climatic conditions\r\nmay prevail here that can scarcely exist on earth.  But what a\r\nmagnificent world to develop, with its great rivers, lakes, and\r\nmountains showing at even this distance, and what natural\r\nresources must be lying there dormant, awaiting our call!  This\r\nconstantly recurs to my mind.  The subjugation and thorough\r\nopening up of this red spot continent will probably supply more\r\ninteresting problems than straightening the axis of the earth."\r\n\r\n"At our next visit," replied Ayrault, "when we have established\r\nregular interplanetary lines of travel, we may have an\r\nopportunity to examine it more closely."  Then they again\r\nattracted the nearest moon beyond which they had swung, increased\r\nthe repulsion on Jupiter, and soared away towards Saturn.\r\n\r\n"We have a striking illustration of Jupiter\'s enormous mass,"\r\nsaid Cortlandt, as the apparent diameter of the mighty planet\r\nrapidly decreased, "in the fact that notwithstanding its numerous\r\nmoons, it still rotates so rapidly.  We know that the earth\'s\r\ndays were formerly but half or a quarter as long as now, having\r\nlasted but six or eight hours.  The explanation of the elongation\r\nis simple: the earth rotates in about twenty-four hours, while\r\nthe moon encircles it but once in nearly twenty- eight days, so\r\nthat our satellite is continually drawing the oceans backward\r\nagainst its motion.  These tidal brakes acting through the\r\nfriction of the water on the bottom, its unequal pressure, and\r\nthe impact of the waves on the shore, are continually retarding\r\nits rotation, so that the day is a fraction of a second longer\r\nnow than it was in the time of Caesar.  This same action is of\r\ncourse taking place in Jupiter and the great planets, in this\r\ncase there being five moons at work.  Our moon, we know, rotates\r\non its axis but once while it revolves about the earth, this\r\nbeing no doubt due to its own comparative smallness and the great\r\nattraction of the earth, which must have produced tremendous\r\ntides before the lunar oceans disappeared from its surface."\r\n\r\nIn crossing the orbits of the satellites, they passed near\r\nGanymede, Jupiter\'s largest moon.\r\n\r\n"This," said Cortlandt, "was discovered by Galileo in\r\n1610.  It is three thousand four hundred and eighty miles\r\nin diameter, while our moon is but two thousand one\r\nhundred and sixty, revolves at a distance of six hundred\r\nand seventy-eight thousand three hundred miles from\r\nJupiter, completes its revolution in seven days and four\r\nhours, and has a specific gravity of 1.87."\r\n\r\nIn passing, they observed that Ganymede possessed an atmosphere,\r\nand continents and oceans of large area.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Bearwarden, "we have a body with a diameter about\r\nfive hundred miles greater than the planet Mercury.  Its size,\r\nlight specific gravity, atmosphere, and oceans seem to indicate\r\nthat it is less advanced than that planet, yet you think Jupiter\r\nhas had a longer separate existence than the planets nearer the\r\nsun?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," said Cortlandt.  "Jupiter was condensed while in\r\nthe solar-system nebula, and began its individual existence and\r\nits evolutionary career long before Mercury was formed.  The\r\nmatter now in Ganymede, however, doubtless remained part of the\r\nJupiter-system nebula till after Mercury\'s creation, and, being\r\npart of so great a mass, did not cool very rapidly.  I should say\r\nthat this satellite has about the same relation to Jupiter that\r\nJupiter has to the sun, and is therefore younger in point of time\r\nas well as of development than the most distant Callisto, and\r\nolder, at all events in years, than Europa and Io, both of which\r\nare nearer.  This supposition is corroborated by the fact that\r\nEuropa, the smallest of these four, is also the densest, having a\r\nspecific gravity of 2.14, its smallness having enabled it to\r\novertake Ganymede in development, notwithstanding the latter\'s\r\nstart.  In the face of the evidence before us we must believe\r\nthis, or else that, perhaps, as in the case of the asteroid\r\nHilda, something like a collision has rejuvenated it.  This might\r\naccount for its size, and for the Nautical Almanac\'s statement\r\nthat there is a \'small and variable\' inclination to its orbit,\r\nwhile Io and Europa revolve exactly in the plane of Jupiter\'s\r\nequator."\r\n\r\nThey had about as long a journey before them as they had already\r\nmade in going from the earth to Jupiter.  The great planet soon\r\nappeared as a huge crescent, since it was between them and the\r\nsun; its moons became as fifth- and sixth-magnitude stars, and in\r\nthe evening of the next day Jupiter\'s disk became invisible to\r\nthe unaided eye.  Since there were no way stations, in the shape\r\nof planets or asteroids, between Jupiter and Saturn, they kept\r\nthe maximum repulsion on Jupiter as long as possible, and moved\r\nat tremendous speed.  Saturn was somewhat in advance of Jupiter\r\nin its orbit, so that their course from the earth had been along\r\ntwo sides of a triangle with an obtuse angle between.  During the\r\nnext four terrestrial days they sighted several small comets, but\r\nspent most of their time writing out their Jovian experiences.\r\nDuring the sixth day Saturn\'s rings, although not as much tilted\r\nas they would be later in the planet\'s season, presented a most\r\nsuperb sight, while they spun in the sun\'s rays.  Soon after this\r\nthe eight moons became visible, and, while slightly reducing the\r\nCallisto\'s speed, they crossed the orbits of Iapetus, Hyperion,\r\nand Titan, when they knew they were but seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand miles from Saturn.\r\n\r\n"I am anxious to ascertain," said Cortlandt, "whether the\r\ncomposition of yonder rings is similar to that of the comet\r\nthrough which we passed.  I am sure they shine with more than\r\nreflected light."\r\n\r\n"We have been in the habit," said Ayrault, "of associating heat\r\nwith light, but it is obvious there is something far more subtle\r\nabout cometary light and that of Saturn\'s rings, both of which\r\nseem to have their birth in the intense cold of interplanetary\r\nspace."\r\n\r\nPassing close to Mimas, Saturn\'s nearest moon, they supplemented\r\nits attraction, after swinging by, by their own strong pull,\r\nbringing their speed down to dead slow as they entered the\r\noutside ring.  At distances often of half a mile they found\r\nmeteoric masses, sometimes lumps the size of a house, often no\r\nlarger than apples, while small particles like grains of sand\r\nmoved between them.  There were two motions.  The ring revolved\r\nabout Saturn, and the particles vibrated among themselves,\r\nevidently kept apart by a mutual repulsion, which seemed both to\r\nincrease and decrease faster than gravitation; for on approaching\r\none another they were more strongly repelled than attracted, but\r\nwhen they separated the repulsion decreased faster than the\r\nattraction, so that after a time divergence ceased, and they\r\nremained at fixed distances.\r\n\r\nThe Callisto soon became imbued with motion also, but nothing\r\never struck it.  When any large mass came unusually near, both it\r\nand their car emitted light, and they rapidly separated.  The\r\nsunlight was not as strong here as it had been when they entered\r\nthe comet, and as they penetrated farther they were better able\r\nto observe the omnipresent luminosity.  They were somewhat\r\npuzzled by the approach of certain light-centres, which seemed to\r\ncontain nothing but this concentrated brightness.  Occasionally\r\none of these centres would glow very brightly near them, and\r\nsimultaneously recede.  At such times the Callisto also glowed,\r\nand itself recoiled slightly.  At first the travellers could not\r\naccount for this, but finally they concluded that the centres\r\nmust be meteoric masses consisting entirely of gases, possessing\r\nweight though invisible.\r\n\r\n"We have again to face," said Cortlandt, "that singular law that\r\ntill recently we did not suppose existed on earth.  All kinds of\r\nsuppositions have been advanced in explanation of these rings.\r\nSome writers have their thickness, looked at from the thin edge,\r\nas four hundred miles, some one hundred, and some but forty.  One\r\nastronomer of the nineteenth century, a man of considerable\r\neminence, was convinced that they consisted of sheets of liquid.\r\nNow, it should be obvious that no liquid could maintain itself\r\nhere for a minute, for it would either fall upon the planet as a\r\ncrushing hail, or, if dependent for its shape on its own\r\ntenacity, it would break if formed of the toughest steel, on\r\naccount of the tremendous weight.  Any number of theories have\r\nbeen advanced by any number of men, but in weight we have the\r\nrub.  No one has ever shown how these innumerable fragments\r\nmaintain themselves at a height of but a few thousand miles above\r\nSaturn, withstanding the giant\'s gravitation-pull.  Their rate of\r\nrevolution, though rapid, does not seem fast enough to sustain\r\nthem.  Neither have I ever seen it explained why the small\r\nfragments do not fall upon the large ones, though many\r\nastronomers have pictured the composition of these rings as we\r\nfind they exist.  Nor do we know why the molecules of a gas are\r\ndriven farther apart by heat, while their activity is also\r\nincreased, though if this activity were revolution about one\r\nanother to develop the centrifugal, it would not need to be as\r\nstrong then as when they are cold and nearer together.  There may\r\nbe explanations, but I have found none in any of the literature I\r\nhave read.  It seems to me that all this leads to but one\r\nconclusion, viz.: apergy is the constant and visible companion of\r\ngravitation, on these great planets Jupiter and Saturn, perhaps\r\non account of some peculiar influence they possess, and also in\r\ncomets, in the case of large masses, while on earth it appears\r\nnaturally only among molecules--those of gases and every other\r\nsubstance."\r\n\r\n"I should go a step further," said Bearwarden, "and say our earth\r\nhas the peculiarity, since it does not possess the influence\r\nnecessary to generate naturally a great or even considerable\r\ndevelopment of apergy.  The electricity of thunderstorms,\r\nnorthern lights, and other forces seems to be produced freely,\r\nbut as regards apergy our planet\'s natural productiveness appears\r\nto be small."\r\n\r\nThe omnipresent luminosity continued, but the glow was scarcely\r\nbright enough to be perceived from the earth.\r\n\r\n"I believe, however," said Bearwarden, referring to this, "that\r\nwhenever a satellite passes near these fragments, preferably when\r\nit enters the planet\'s shadow, since that will remove its own\r\nlight, it will create such activity among them as to make the\r\nluminosity visible to the large telescopes or gelatine plates on\r\nearth."\r\n\r\n"Now," said Ayrault, "that we have evolved enough theories to\r\nkeep astronomers busy for some time, if they attempt to discuss\r\nthem, I suggest that we alight and leave the abstract for the\r\nconcrete."\r\n\r\nWhereupon they passed through the inner ring and rapidly sank to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BOOK III.\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                             SATURN.\r\n\r\nLanding on a place about ten degrees north of the equator, so\r\nthat they might obtain a good view of the great rings--since ON\r\nthe line only the thin edge would be visible--they opened a\r\nport-hole with the same caution they had exercised on Jupiter.\r\nAgain there was a rush of air, showing that the pressure without\r\nwas greater than that within; but on this occasion the barometer\r\nstopped at thirty-eight, from which they calculated that the\r\npressure was nineteen pounds to the square inch on their bodies,\r\ninstead of fifteen as at sea-level on earth.  This difference was\r\nso slight that they scarcely felt it.  They also discarded the\r\napergetic outfits that had been so useful on Jupiter, as\r\nunnecessary here.  The air was an icy blast, and though they\r\nquickly closed the opening, the interior of the Callisto was\r\nconsiderably chilled.\r\n\r\n"We shall want our winter clothes," said Bearwarden; "it might be\r\nmore comfortable for us exactly on the equator, though the scene\r\nat night will be far finer here, if we can stand the climate.\r\nDoubtless it will also be warmer soon, for the sun has but just\r\nrisen."\r\n\r\n"I suspect this is merely one of the cold waves that rush towards\r\nthe equator at this season, which corresponds to about the 10th\r\nof our September," replied Cortlandt.  "The poles of Saturn must\r\nbe intensely cold during its long winter of fourteen and three\r\nquarter years, for, the axis being inclined twenty-seven degrees\r\nfrom the perpendicular of its orbit, the pole turned from the sun\r\nis more shut off from its heat than ours, and in addition to this\r\nthe mean distance--more than eight hundred and eighty million\r\nmiles--is very great.  Since the chemical composition of the air\r\nwe have inhaled has not troubled our lungs, it is fair to suppose\r\nwe shall have no difficulty in breathing."\r\n\r\nHaving dressed themselves more warmly, and seen by a thermometer\r\nthey had placed outside that the temperature was thirty-eight\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, which had seemed very cold compared with the\r\nwarmth inside the Callisto, they again opened the port-hole, this\r\ntime leaving it open longer.  What they had felt before was\r\nevidently merely a sudden gust, for the air was now comparatively\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nFinding that the doctor\'s prediction as to the suitability of the\r\nair to their lungs was correct, they ventured out, closing the\r\ndoor as they went.\r\n\r\nExpecting, as on Jupiter, to find principally vertebrates of the\r\nreptile and bird order, they carried guns and cartridges loaded\r\nwith buckshot and No. 1, trusting for solid-ball projectiles to\r\ntheir revolvers, which they shoved into their belts.  They also\r\ntook test- tubes for experiments on the Saturnian bacilli.\r\nHanging a bucket under the pipe leading from the roof, to catch\r\nany rain that might fall--for they remembered the scarcity of\r\ndrinking-water on Jupiter--they set out in a southwesterly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWalking along, they noticed on all sides tall lilies immaculately\r\npure in their whiteness, and mushrooms and toadstools nearly a\r\nfoot high, the former having a delicious flavour and extreme\r\nfreshness, as though only an hour old.  They had seen no animal\r\nlife, or even sign of it, and were wondering at its dearth, when\r\nsuddenly two large white birds rose directly in front of them.\r\nLike thought, Bearwarden and Ayrault had their guns up, snapping\r\nthe thumb-pieces over "safe" and pulling the triggers almost\r\nsimultaneously.  Bearwarden, having double buckshot, killed his\r\nbird at the first fire; but Ayrault, having only No. 1, had to\r\ngive his the second barrel, almost all damage in both cases being\r\nin the head.  On coming close to their victims they found them to\r\nmeasure twelve feet from tip to tip, and to have a tremendous\r\nthickness of feathers and down.\r\n\r\n"From the looks of these beauties," said Bearwarden, "I should\r\nsay they probably inhabited a pretty cold place."\r\n\r\n"They are doubtless northern birds," said Cortlandt, "that have\r\njust come south.  It is easy to believe that the depth to which\r\nthe temperature may fall in the upper air of this planet must be\r\nsomething startling."\r\n\r\nAs they turned from the cranes, to which species the birds seemed\r\nto belong, they became mute with astonishment.  Every mushroom\r\nhad disappeared, but the toadstools still remained.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible we did not see them?" gasped Ayrault.\r\n\r\n"We must inadvertently have walked some distance since we saw\r\nthem," said Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"They were what I looked forward to for lunch," exclaimed\r\nBearwarden.\r\n\r\nThey were greatly perplexed.  The mushrooms were all about them\r\nwhen they shot the birds, which still lay where they had fallen.\r\n\r\n"We must be very absent-minded," said the doctor,  "or perchance\r\nour brains are affected by the air.  We must analyze it to see if\r\nit contains our own proportion of oxygen and nitrogen.  There was\r\na good deal of carbonic-acid gas on Jupiter, but that would\r\nhardly confuse our senses.  The strange thing is, that we all\r\nseem to have been impressed the same way."\r\n\r\nConcluding that they must have been mistaken, they continued on\r\ntheir journey.\r\n\r\nAll about they heard a curious humming, as that of bees, or like\r\nthe murmuring of prayers in a resonant cathedral.  Thinking it\r\nwas the wind in the great trees that grew singly around them,\r\nthey paid no attention to it until, emerging on an open plain and\r\nfinding that the sound continued, they stopped.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Bearwarden, "this is more curious than anything we\r\nfound on Jupiter.  Here we have an incessant and rather pleasant\r\nsound, with no visible cause."\r\n\r\n"It may possibly be some peculiarity of the grass," replied\r\nCortlandt, "though, should it continue when we reach sandy or\r\nbare soil, I shall believe we need a dose of quinine."\r\n\r\n"I FEEL perfectly well," said Ayrault; "how is it with you?"\r\n\r\nEach finding that he was in a normal state, they proceeded,\r\ndetermined, if possible, to discover the source from which the\r\nsounds came.  Suddenly Bearwarden raised his gun to bring down a\r\nlong-beaked hawk; but the bird flew off, and he did not shoot.\r\n"Plague the luck!" said he; "I went blind just as I was about to\r\npull.  A haze seemed to cover both barrels, and completely\r\nscreened the bird."\r\n\r\n"The Callisto will soon be hidden by those trees," said\r\nCortlandt.  "I think we had better take our bearings, for, if our\r\ncrack shot is going to miss like that, we may want canned\r\nprovisions."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he got out his sextant, took the altitude of the\r\nsun, got cross-bearings and a few angles, and began to make a\r\nrough calculation.  For several minutes he worked industriously,\r\nused the rubber at the end of his pencil, tried again, and then\r\nscratched out.  "That humming confuses me so that I cannot work\r\ncorrectly," said he, "while the most irrelevant things enter my\r\nmind in spite of me, and mix up my figures."\r\n\r\n"I found the same thing," said Bearwarden, "but said nothing, for\r\nfear I should not be believed.  In addition to going blind, for a\r\nmoment I almost forgot what I was trying to do."\r\n\r\nChanging their course slightly, they went towards a range of\r\nhills, in the hope of finding rocky or sandy soil, in order to\r\ntest the sounds, and ascertain if they would cease or vary.\r\n\r\nHaving ascended a few hundred feet, they sat down near some trees\r\nto rest, the musical hum continuing meanwhile unchanged.  The\r\nground was strewn with large coloured crystals, apparently\r\nrubies, sapphires, and emeralds, about the size of hens\' eggs,\r\nand also large sheets of isinglass.  Picking up one of the\r\nlatter, Ayrault examined it.  Points of light and shade kept\r\nforming on its surface, from which rings radiated like the\r\ncircles spreading in all directions from a place in still water\r\nat which a pebble is thrown.  He called his companions, and the\r\nthree examined it.  The isinglass was about ten inches long by\r\neight across, and contained but few impurities.  In addition to\r\nthe spreading rings, curious forms were continually taking shape\r\nand dissolving.\r\n\r\n"This is more interesting," said Bearwarden, "than sounding\r\nshells at the sea-shore.  We must make a note of it as another\r\nthing to study."\r\n\r\nThey then spread their handkerchiefs on a mound of earth, so as\r\nto make a table, and began examining the gems.\r\n\r\n"Does it not seem to you," asked Ayrault, a few minutes later,\r\naddressing his companions, "as though we were not alone?  I have\r\nthought many times there was some one--or perhaps several\r\npersons--here besides ourselves."\r\n\r\n"The same idea has occurred to me," replied Cortlandt.  "I was\r\nconvinced, a moment ago, that a shadow crossed the page on which\r\nI was taking notes.  Can it be there are objects about us we\r\ncannot see?  We know there are vibrations of both light and sound\r\nthat do not affect our senses.  I wish we had brought the\r\nmagnetic eye; perchance that might tell us."\r\n\r\n"Anything sufficiently dense to cast a shadow," said Ayrault,\r\n"should be seen, since it would also be able to make an image on\r\nour retinas.  I believe any impressions we are receiving are\r\nproduced through our minds, as if some one were thinking very\r\nintently about us, and that neither the magnetic eye nor a\r\nsensitive plate could reveal anything."\r\n\r\nThey then returned to the study of the isinglass, which they were\r\nable to split into extremely thin sheets.  Suddenly a cloud\r\npassed over the table, and almost immediately disappeared, and\r\nthen a sharpened pencil with which Ayrault had been writing began\r\nto trace on a sheet of paper, in an even hand, and with a slight\r\nfrictional sound.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said Bearwarden; "let us each for himself describe in\r\nwriting what he has seen."\r\n\r\nIn a moment they had done this, and then compared notes.  In each\r\ncase the vision was the same.  Then they looked at the writing\r\nmade by the invisible hand.  "Absorpta est mors in Victoria," it\r\nran.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, began Bearwarden, as if addressing a meeting, "this\r\ncannot be coincidence; we are undoubtedly and unquestionably in\r\nthe presence of a spirit or of several spirits.  That they\r\nunderstand Latin, we see; and, from what they say, they may have\r\nknown death.  Time may show whether they have been terrestrials\r\nlike ourselves.  Though the conditions of life here might make us\r\ndelirious, it is scarcely possible that different temperaments\r\nlike ours should be affected in so precisely the same way;\r\nbesides, in this writing we have tangible proof."\r\n\r\n"It is perfectly reasonable," said Ayrault, "to conclude it was a\r\nspirit, if we may assume that spirits have the power to move the\r\npencil, which is a material object.  Nobody doubts nowadays that\r\nafter death we live again; that being the case, we must admit\r\nthat we live somewhere.  Space, as I take it, can be no obstacle\r\nto a spirit; therefore, why suppose they remain on earth?"\r\n\r\n"This is a wonderful place," said Cortlandt.  "We have already\r\nseen enough to convince us of the existence of many unknown laws.\r\nI wish the spirit would reveal itself in some other way."\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking, the rays of the distant and cold-looking\r\nsun were split, and the colours of the spectrum danced upon the\r\nlinen cloth, as if obtained by a prism.  In astonishment, they\r\nrose and looked closely at the table, when suddenly a shadow that\r\nno one recognized as his own appeared upon the cover.  Tracing it\r\nto its source, their eyes met those of an old man with a white\r\nrobe and beard and a look of great intelligence on his calm face.\r\nThey knew he had not been in the little grove thirty seconds\r\nbefore, and as this was surrounded by open country there was no\r\nplace from which he could have come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                    THE SPIRIT\'S FIRST VISIT.\r\n\r\n"Greetings and congratulations," he said.  "Man has\r\nsteadfastly striven to rise, and we see the results in\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I have always believed in the existence of spirits," said\r\nCortlandt, "but never expected to see one with my natural eyes."\r\n\r\n"And you never will, in its spiritual state," replied the shade,\r\n"unless you supplement sight with reason.  A spirit has merely\r\nexistence, entity, and will, and is entirely invisible to your\r\neyes."\r\n\r\n"How is it, then, that we see and hear you?" asked Cortlandt.\r\n"Are you a man, or a spectre that is able to affect our senses?"\r\n\r\n"I WAS a man," replied the spirit, "and I have given myself\r\nvisible and tangible form to warn you of danger.  My colleagues\r\nand I watched you when you left the cylinder and when you shot\r\nthe birds, and, seeing your doom in the air, have been trying to\r\ncommunicate with you."\r\n\r\n"What were the strange shadows and prismatic colours that kept\r\npassing across our table?" asked Bearwarden.\r\n\r\n"They were the obstructions and refractions of light caused by\r\nspirits trying to take shape," replied the shade.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind our asking you questions?" said Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"No," replied their visitor.  "If I can, I will answer them."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Cortlandt, "how is it that, of the several spirits\r\nthat tried to become embodied, we see but one, namely, you?"\r\n\r\n"That," said the shade, "is because no natural law is broken.  On\r\nearth one man can learn a handicraft better in a few days than\r\nanother in a month, while some can solve with ease a mathematical\r\nproblem that others could never grasp.  So it is here.  Perhaps I\r\nwas in a favourable frame of mind on dying, for the so-called\r\nsupernatural always interested me on earth, or I had a natural\r\naptitude for these things; for soon after death I was able to\r\naffect the senses of the friends I had left."\r\n\r\n"Are we to understand, then," asked Cortlandt, "that the reason\r\nmore of our departed do not reappear to us is because they\r\ncannot?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely," replied the shade.  "But though the percentage of\r\nthose that can return and reappear on earth is small, their\r\nnumber is fairly large.  History has many cases.  We know that\r\nthe prophet Samuel raised the witch of Endor at the behest of\r\nSaul; that Moses and Elias became visible in the transfiguration;\r\nand that after his crucifixion and burial Christ returned to his\r\ndisciples, and was seen and heard by many others."\r\n\r\n"How," asked Bearwarden deferentially, "do you occupy your time?"\r\n\r\n"Time, replied the spirit, "has not the same significance to us\r\nthat it has to you.  You know that while the earth rotates in\r\ntwenty-four hours, this planet takes but about ten; and the sun\r\nturns on its own axis but once in a terrestrial month; while the\r\nyears of the planets vary from less than three months for Mercury\r\nto Neptune\'s one hundred and sixty-four years.  Being insensible\r\nto heat and cold, darkness and light, we have no more changing\r\nseasons, neither is there any night.  When a man dies," he\r\ncontinued with solemnity, "he comes at once into the enjoyment of\r\nsenses vastly keener than any be possessed before.  Our eyes--if\r\nsuch they can be called--are both microscopes and telescopes, the\r\nchange in focus being effected as instantaneously as thought,\r\nenabling us to perceive the smallest microbe or disease-germ, and\r\nto see the planets that revolve about the stars.  The step of a\r\nfly is to us as audible as the tramp of a regiment, while we hear\r\nthe mechanical and chemical action of a snake\'s poison on the\r\nblood of any poor creature bitten, as plainly as the waves on the\r\nshore.  We also have a chemical and electrical sense, showing us\r\nwhat effect different substances will have on one another, and\r\nwhat changes to expect in the weather.  The most complex and\r\nsubtle of our senses, however, is a sort of second sight that we\r\ncall intuition or prescience, which we are still studying to\r\nperfect and understand.  With our eyes closed it reveals to us\r\napproaching astronomical and other bodies, or what is happening\r\non the other side of the planet, and enables us to view the\r\nfuture as you do the past.  The eyes of all but the highest\r\nangels require some light, and can be dazzled by an excess; but\r\nthis attribute of divinity nothing can obscure, and it is the\r\nsense that will first enable us to know God.  By means of these\r\nnew and sharpened faculties, which, like children, we are\r\ncontinually learning to use to better advantage, we constantly\r\nincrease our knowledge, and this is next to our greatest\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"Is there any limit," asked Bearwarden, "to human progress on the\r\nearth?"\r\n\r\n"Practically none," replied the spirit.  "Progress depends\r\nlargely on your command of the forces of Nature.  At present your\r\nprincipal sources of power are food, fuel, electricity, the heat\r\nof the interior of the earth, wind, and tide.  From the first two\r\nyou cannot expect much more than now, but from the internal heat\r\neverywhere available, tradewinds, and falling water, as at\r\nNiagara, and from tides, you can obtain power almost without\r\nlimit.  Were this all, however, your progress would be slow; but\r\nthe Eternal, realizing the shortness of your lives, has given you\r\npower with which to rend the globe.  You have the action of all\r\nuncombined chemicals, atmospheric electricity, the excess or\r\nfroth of which you now see in thunderstorms, and the electricity\r\nand magnetism of your own bodies.  There is also molecular and\r\nsympathetic vibration, by which Joshua not understandingly\r\nlevelled the walls of Jericho; and the power of your minds over\r\nmatter, but little more developed now than when I moved in the\r\nflesh upon the earth.  By lowering large quantities of\r\nhigh-powered explosives to the deepest parts of the ocean bed,\r\nand exploding them there, you can produce chasms through which\r\nsome water will be forced towards the heated interior by the\r\nenormous pressure of its own weight.  At a comparatively slight\r\ndepth it will be converted into steam and produce an earthquake.\r\nThis will so enlarge your chasm, that a great volume of water\r\nwill rush into the red-hot interior, which will cause a series of\r\nsuch terrific eruptions that large islands will be upheaved.  By\r\nthe reduction of the heat of that part of the interior there will\r\nalso be a shrinkage, which, in connection with the explosions,\r\nwill cause the earth\'s solid crust to be thrown up in folds till\r\nwhole continents appear.  Some of the water displaced by the new\r\nland will also, as a result of the cooling, be able permanently\r\nto penetrate farther, thereby decreasing by that much the amount\r\nof water in the oceans, so that the tide-level in your existing\r\nseaports will be but slightly changed.  By persevering in this\r\nwork, you will become so skilled that it will be possible to\r\nevoke land of whatever kind you wish, at any place; and by having\r\nhigh table-land at the equator, sloping off into low plains\r\ntowards north and south, and maintaining volcanoes in eruption at\r\nthe poles to throw out heat and start warm ocean currents, it\r\nwill be possible, in connection with the change you are now\r\nmaking in the axis, to render the conditions of life so easy that\r\nthe earth will support a far larger number of souls.\r\n\r\n"With the powers at your disposal you can also alter and improve\r\nexisting continents, and thereby still further increase the\r\nnumber of the children of men.  Perhaps with mild climate,\r\nfertile soil, and decreased struggle for existence, man will\r\ndevelop his spiritual side.\r\n\r\n"Finally, you have apergy, one of the highest forces, for it puts\r\nyou almost on a plane with angels, and with it you have already\r\nvisited Jupiter and Saturn.  It was impossible that man should\r\nremain chained to the earth during the entire life of his race,\r\nlike an inferior animal or a mineral, lower even in freedom of\r\nbody than birds.  Heretofore you have, as I have said, seen but\r\none side in many workings of Nature, as if you had discovered\r\neither negative or positive electricity, but not both; for\r\ngravitation and apergy are as inseparably combined in the rest of\r\nthe universe as those two, separated temporarily on earth that\r\nthe discovery of the utilization of one with the other might\r\nserve as an incentive to your minds.  You saw it in Nature on\r\nJupiter in the case of several creatures, suspecting it in the\r\nboa-constrictor and Will-o\'-the-wisp and jelly-fish, and have\r\nstanding illustrations of it in all tailed comets-- luminosity in\r\nthe case of large bodies being one manifestation--in the rings of\r\nthis planet, and in the molecular motion and porosity of all\r\ngases, liquids, and solids on earth; since what else is it that\r\nkeeps the molecules apart, heat serving merely to increase its\r\npower?  God made man in his own image; does it not stand to\r\nreason that he will allow him to continue to become more and more\r\nlike himself?  Would he begrudge him the power to move mountains\r\nthrough the intelligent application of Nature\'s laws, when he\r\nhimself said they might be moved by faith?  So far you have been\r\ncontent to use the mechanical power of water, its momentum or\r\ndead weight merely; to attain a much higher civilization, you\r\nmust break it up chemically and use its constituent gases."\r\n\r\n"How," asked Bearwarden, "can this be done?"\r\n\r\n"Force superheated steam," replied the spirit, "through an\r\nintensely heated substance, as you now do in making\r\nwater-gas--preferably platinum heated by electricity--apply an\r\napergetic shock, and the oxygen and hydrogen will separate like\r\noil and water, the oxygen being so much the heavier.  Lead them\r\nin different directions as fast as the water is decomposed--since\r\notherwise they would reunite--and your supply of power will be\r\ninexhaustible."\r\n\r\n"Will you not stay and dine with us?" asked Ayrault.  "While in\r\nthe flesh you must be subject to its laws, and must need food to\r\nmaintain your strength, like ourselves."\r\n\r\n"It will give me great pleasure," replied the spirit, "to tarry\r\nwith you, and once more to taste earthly food, but most of all to\r\nhave the blessed joy of being of service to you.  Here, all being\r\nimmaterial spirits, no physical injury can befall any of us; and\r\nsince no one wants anything that any one else can give, we have\r\nno opportunity of doing anything for each other.  You see we\r\nneither eat nor sleep, neither can any of us again know physical\r\npain or death, nor can we comfort one another, for every one\r\nknows the truth about himself and every one else, and we read one\r\nanother\'s thoughts as an open book."\r\n\r\n"Do you," asked Bearwarden, "not eat at all?\r\n\r\n"We absorb vitality in a sense," replied the spirit.  "As the sun\r\ncombines certain substances into food for mortals, it also\r\nproduces molecular vibration and charges the air with magnetism\r\nand electricity, which we absorb without effort.  In fact, there\r\nis a faint pleasure in the absorption of this strength, when, in\r\nmagnetic disturbances, there is an unusual amount of immortal\r\nfood.  Should we try to resist it, there would eventually be a\r\ngreater pressure without than within, and we should assimilate\r\ninvoluntarily.  We are part of the intangible universe, and can\r\nfeel no hunger that is not instantly appeased, neither can we\r\never more know thirst."\r\n\r\n"Why," asked Cortlandt reverently, " did the angel with the sword\r\nof flame drive Adam from the Tree of Life, since with his soul he\r\nhad received that which could never die?"\r\n\r\n"That was part of the mercy of God," the shade replied; "for\r\nimmortality could be enjoyed but meagrely on earth, where natural\r\nlimitations are so abrupt.  And know this, ye who are something\r\nof chemists, that had Adam eaten of that substance called fruit,\r\nhe would have lived in the flesh to this day, and would have been\r\nof all men the most unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Will the Fountain of Youth ever be discovered?" asked Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"That substances exist," replied the spirit, "that render it\r\nimpossible for the germs of old age and decay to lodge in the\r\nbody, I know; in fact, it would be a break in the continuity and\r\nbalance of Nature did they not; but I believe their discovery\r\nwill be coincident with Christ\'s second visible advent on earth.\r\nYou are, however, only on the shore of the ocean of knowledge,\r\nand, by continuing to advance in geometric ratio, will soon be\r\nable to retain your mortal bodies till the average longevity\r\nexceeds Methuselah\'s; but, except for more opportunities of doing\r\ngood, or setting a longer example to your fellows by your lives,\r\nwhere would be the gain?\r\n\r\n"I now see how what appeared to me while I lived on earth\r\ninsignificant incidents, were the acts of God, and that what I\r\nthought injustice or misfortune was but evidence of his wisdom\r\nand love; for we know that not a sparrow falleth without God, and\r\nthat the hairs of our heads are numbered.  Every act of kindness\r\nor unselfishness on my part, also, stands out like a golden\r\nletter or a white stone, and gives me unspeakable comfort.  At\r\nthe last judgment, and in eternity following, we shall have very\r\ndifferent but just as real bodies as those that we possessed in\r\nthe flesh.  The dead at the last trump will rise clothed in them,\r\nand at that time the souls in paradise will receive them also."\r\n\r\n"I wonder," thought Ayrault, "on which hand we shall be placed in\r\nthat last day."\r\n\r\n"The classification is now going on," said the spirit, answering\r\nhis thought, "and I know that in the final judgment each\r\nindividual will range himself automatically on his proper side."\r\n\r\n"Do tell me," said Ayrault, "how you were able to answer my\r\nthought."\r\n\r\n"I see the vibrations of the grey matter of your brain as plainly\r\nas the movements of your lips"; in fact, I see the thoughts in\r\nthe embryonic state taking shape."\r\n\r\nWhen their meal was ready they sat down, Ayrault placing the\r\nspirit on his right, with Cortlandt on his left, and having\r\nBearwarden opposite.  On this occasion their chief had given them\r\na particularly good dinner, but the spirit took only a slice of\r\nmeat and a glass of claret.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you tell us the story of your life," said Ayrault to the\r\nspirit, "and your experiences since your death?  They would be of\r\ntremendous interest to us."\r\n\r\n"I was a bishop in one of the Atlantic States," replied the\r\nspirit gravely, "and died shortly before the civil war.  People\r\ncame from other cities to hear my sermons, and the biographical\r\nwriters have honoured my memory by saying that I was a great man.\r\nI was contemporaneous with Daniel Webster and Henry Clay.\r\nShortly after I reached threescore and ten, according to earthly\r\nyears, I caught what I considered only a slight cold, for I had\r\nalways had good health, but it became pneumonia.  My friends,\r\nchildren, and grandchildren came to see me, and all seemed going\r\nwell, when, without warning, my physician told me I had but a few\r\nhours to live.  I could scarcely believe my ears; and though, as\r\na Churchman, I had ministered to others and had always tried to\r\nlead a good life, I was greatly shocked.  I suddenly remembered\r\nall the things I had left undone and all the things I intended to\r\ndo, and the old saying, \'Hell is paved with good intentions,\'\r\ncrossed my mind very forcibly.  In less than an hour I saw the\r\nphysician was right; I grew weaker and my pulse fluttered, but my\r\nmind remained clear.  I prayed to my Creator with all my soul, \'O\r\nspare me a little, that I may recover my strength, before I go\r\nhence, and be no more seen.\'  As if for an answer, the thought\r\ncrossed my brain, \'Set thine house in order, for thou shalt not\r\nlive, but die.\'  I then called my children and made disposition\r\nof such of my property and personal effects as were not covered\r\nby my will.  I also gave to each the advice that my experience\r\nhad shown me he or she needed.  Then came another wave of remorse\r\nand regret, and again an intense longing to pray; but along with\r\nthe thought of sins and neglected duties came also the memory of\r\nthe honest efforts I had made to obey my conscience, and these\r\nwere like rifts of sunshine during a storm.  These thoughts, and\r\nthe blessed promises of religion I had so often preached in the\r\nchurches of my diocese, were an indescribable comfort, and saved\r\nme from the depths of blank despair.  Finally my breathing became\r\nlaboured, I had sharp spasms of pain, and my pulse almost\r\nstopped.  I felt that I was dying, and my sight grew dim.  The\r\ncrisis and climax of life were at hand.  \'Oh!\' I thought, with\r\nthe philosophers and sages, \'is it to this end I lived?  The\r\nflower appears, briefly blooms amid troublous toil, and is gone;\r\nmy body returns to its primordial dust, and my works are buried\r\nin oblivion.  The paths of life and glory lead but to the grave.\'\r\nMy soul was filled with conflicting thoughts, and for a moment\r\neven my faith seemed at a low ebb.  I could hear my children\'s\r\nstifled sobs, and my darling wife shed silent tears.  The thought\r\nof parting from them gave me the bitterest wrench.  With my\r\nfleeting breath I gasped these words, \'That mercy I showed\r\nothers, that show thou me.\'  The darkened room grew darker, and\r\nafter that I died.  In my sleep I seemed to dream.  All about\r\nwere refined and heavenly flowers, while the most delightful\r\nsounds and perfumes filled the air.  Gradually the vision became\r\nmore distinct, and I experienced an indescribable feeling of\r\npeace and repose.  I passed through fields and scenes I had never\r\nseen before, while every place was filled with an all-pervading\r\nlight.  Sometimes I seemed to be miles in air; countless suns and\r\ntheir planets shone, and dazzled my eyes, while no\r\nbird-of-paradise was as happy or free as I.  Gradually it came to\r\nme that I was awake, and that it was no dream.  Then I remembered\r\nmy last moments, and perceived that I had died.  Death had\r\nbrought freedom, my work in the flesh was ended, I was indeed\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n"\'O Death, where is thy sting?  O Grave, where is thy victory?\'\r\nIn my dying moments I had forgotten what I had so often\r\npreached--\'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened\r\nexcept it die.\'  In a moment my life lay before me like a valley\r\nor an open page.  All along its paths and waysides I saw the\r\nlittle seeds of word and deed that I had sown extending and\r\nbearing fruit forever for good or evil.  I then saw things as\r\nthey were, and realized the faultiness of my former conclusions,\r\nbased as they had been on the incomplete knowledge obtained\r\nthrough embryonic senses.  I also saw the Divine purpose in life\r\nas the design in a piece of tapestry, whereas before I had seen\r\nbut the wrong side.  It is not till we have lost the life in the\r\nflesh that we realize its dignity and value, for every hour gives\r\nus opportunities of helping or elevating some human being-- it\r\nmay be ourselves--of doing something in His service.\r\n\r\n"Now that time is past, the books are closed, and we can do\r\nnothing further ourselves to alter our status for eternity,\r\nhowever much we may wish to.  It is on this account, and not\r\nmerely to save you from death, which in itself is nothing, that I\r\nnow tell you to run to the Callisto, seal the doors hermetically,\r\nand come not forth till a sudden rush of air that you will see on\r\nthe trees has passed.  A gust in which even birds drop dead, if\r\nthey are unable to escape, will be here when you reach safety.\r\nDo not delay to take this food, and eat none of it when you\r\nreturn, for it will be filled with poisonous germs."\r\n\r\n"How can we find you? " asked Ayrault, grasping his hand.  "You\r\nmust not leave us till we know how we can see you again."\r\n\r\n"Think hard and steadfastly of me, you three," replied the\r\nspirit, "if you want me, and I shall feel your thought"; saying\r\nwhich, he vanished before their eyes, and the three friends ran\r\nto the Callisto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                     DOUBTS AND PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nOn reaching it, they climbed the ladder leading to the\r\nsecond-story opening, and entering through this, they closed the\r\ndoor, screwing it tightly in place.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Cortlandt, "we can see what changes, if any, this\r\nwonderful gust will effect."\r\n\r\n"He made no strictures on our senses, such as they are," said\r\nBearwarden, "but implied that evolution would be carried much\r\nfurther in us, from which I suppose we may infer that it has not\r\nyet gone far.  I wish we had recorked those brandy peaches, for\r\nnow they will be filled with poisonous germs.  I wonder if our\r\nshady friend could not tell us of an antiseptic with which they\r\nmight be treated?"\r\n\r\n"Those fellows," thought Ayrault, who had climbed to the dome,\r\nfrom which he had an extended view, "would jeer at an angel,\r\nwhile the deference they showed the spirit seems, as usual, to\r\nhave been merely superficial."\r\n\r\n"Let us note," said Cortlandt, "that the spirit thermometer\r\noutside has fallen several degrees since we entered, though, from\r\nthe time taken, I should not say that the sudden change would be\r\none of temperature."\r\n\r\nJust then they saw a number of birds, which had been resting in a\r\nclump of trees, take flight suddenly; but they fell to the ground\r\nbefore they had risen far, and were dashed to pieces.  In another\r\nmoment the trees began to bend and sway before the storm; and as\r\nthey gazed, the colour of the leaves turned from green and purple\r\nto orange and red.  The wind blew off many of these, and they\r\nwere carried along by the gusts, or fluttered to the ground,\r\nwhich was soon strewed with them.  It was a typical autumnal\r\nscene.  Presently the wind shifted, and this was followed by a\r\ncold shower of rain.\r\n\r\n"I think the worst is over," said Bearwarden.  "The Sailor\'s\r\nGuide says:\r\n\r\n           \'When the rain\'s before the wind,\r\n            Halliards, sheets, and braces mind;\r\n            When the wind\'s before the rain,\r\n            Soon you can make sail again.\'\r\n\r\nDoubtless that will hold good here."\r\n\r\nThis proved to be correct; and, after a repetition of the\r\nprecautions they had taken on their arrival on the planet in\r\nregard to the inhalability of the air, they again sallied forth.\r\nThey left their magazine shot-guns, taking instead the\r\ndouble-barrelled kind, on account of the rapidity with which this\r\nenabled them to fire the second barrel after the first, and threw\r\naway the water that had collected in the bucket, out of respect\r\nto the spirit\'s warning.  They noticed a pungent odour, and\r\ndecided to remain on high ground, since they had observed that\r\nthe birds, in their effort to escape, had flown almost vertically\r\ninto the air.  On reaching the grove in which they had seen the\r\nstorm, they found their table and everything on it exactly as\r\nthey had left it.  Bearwarden threw out the brandy peaches on the\r\nground, exclaiming that it was a shame to lose such good\r\npreserves, and they proceeded on their walk.  They passed\r\nhundreds of dead birds, and on reaching the edge of the toadstool\r\nvalley were not a little surprised to find that every toadstool\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said the doctor, "if there can be any connection\r\nbetween the phenomenon of the disappearance of those toadstools\r\nand the death of the birds?  We could easily discover it if they\r\nhad eaten them, or if in any other way the plants could have\r\nentered their bodies; but I see no way in which that can have\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\nResolving to investigate carefully any other fungi they might\r\nsee, they resumed their march.  The cold, distant-looking sun,\r\napparently about the size of an orange, was near the horizon.\r\nSaturn\'s rotation on its axis occupying only ten hours and\r\nfourteen minutes, being but a few minutes longer than Jupiter\'s,\r\nthey knew it would soon be night.  Finding a place on a range of\r\nhills sheltered by rocks and a clump of trees of the evergreen\r\nspecies, they arranged themselves as comfortably as possible, ate\r\nsome of the sandwiches they had brought, lighted their pipes, and\r\nwatched the dying day.  Here were no fire-flies to light the\r\ndarkening minutes, nor singing flowers to lull them to sleep with\r\ntheir song but six of the eight moons, each at a different phase,\r\nand with varied brightness, bathed the landscape in their pale,\r\ncold rays; while far above them, like a huge rainbow, stretched\r\nthe great rings in effulgent sheets, reaching thousands of miles\r\ninto space, and flooded everything with their silvery light.\r\n\r\n"How poor a place compared with this," they thought to\r\nthemselves, "is our world!" and Ayrault wished that his soul was\r\nalready free; while the dead leaves rustling in the gentle\r\nbreeze, and the nightwinds, sighing among the trees, seemed to\r\necho his thought.  Far above their heads, and in the vastness of\r\nspace, the well-known stars and constellations, notwithstanding\r\nthe enormous distance they had now come, looked absolutely\r\nunchanged, and seemed to them emblematic of tranquillity and\r\neternal repose.  The days were changed by their shortness, and by\r\nthe apparent loss of power in the sun; and the nights, as if in\r\ncompensation, were magnificently illuminated by the numerous\r\nmoons and splendid rings, though neither rings nor satellites\r\nshone with as strong a light as the terrestrial moon.  But in\r\nnothing outside of the solar system was there any change; and\r\ncould AEneas\'s Palinurus, or one of Philip of Macedon\'s\r\nshepherds, be brought to life here, he would see exactly the same\r\nstars in the same positions; and, did he not know of his own\r\ndeath or of the lapse of time, he might suppose, so far as the\r\nheavens were affected, that he had but fallen asleep, or had just\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I have always regretted," said Cortlandt, "that I was not born a\r\nthousand years later."\r\n\r\n"Were it not," added Ayrault, "that our earth is the vestibule to\r\nspace, and for the opportunities it opens, I should rather never\r\nhave lived, for life in itself is unsatisfying."\r\n\r\n"You fellows are too indefinite and abstract for me," said\r\nBearwarden.  "I like something tangible and concrete.  The\r\nutilitarianism of the twentieth century, by which I live,\r\nparadoxical though it may seem, would be out of place in space,\r\nunless we can colonize the other planets, and improve their\r\narrangements and axes."\r\n\r\nMixed with Ayrault\'s philosophical and metaphysical thoughts were\r\nthe memories of his sweetheart at Vassar, and he longed, more\r\nthan his companions, for the spirit\'s return, that he might ask\r\nhim if perchance he could tell him aught of her, and whether her\r\nthoughts were then of him.\r\n\r\nFinally, worn out by the fatigue and excitement of the day, they\r\nset the protection-wires, more from force of habit than because\r\nthey feared molestation and, rolling themselves in their\r\nblankets--for the night was cold--were soon fast asleep;\r\nAyrault\'s last thought having been of his fiancee, Cortlandt\'s of\r\nthe question he wished to ask the spirit, and Bearwarden\'s of the\r\nprogress of his Company in the work of straightening the\r\nterrestrial axis.  Thus they slept seven hundred and ninety\r\nmillion miles beyond their earth\'s orbit, and more than eight\r\nhundred million from the place where the earth was then.  While\r\nthey lay unconscious, the clouds above them froze, and before\r\nmorning there was a fall of snow that covered the ground and them\r\nas they lay upon it.  Soon three white mounds were all that\r\nmarked their presence, and the cranes and eagles, rising from\r\ntheir roosts in response to the coming day, looked unconcernedly\r\nat all that was human that they had ever seen.  Finally, wakened\r\nby the resounding cries of these birds, Bearwarden and Cortlandt\r\narose, and meeting Ayrault, who had already risen, mistook the\r\nsnowy form before them for the spirit, and thinking the dead\r\nbishop had revisited them, they were preparing to welcome him,\r\nand to propound the questions they had formulated, when Ayrault\'s\r\nfamiliar voice showed them their mistake.\r\n\r\n"Seeing your white figures," said he, "rise apparently in\r\nresponse to those loud calls, reminded me of what the spirit told\r\nus of the last day, and of the awakening and resurrection of the\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nThe scene was indeed weird.  The east, already streaked with the\r\nrays of the rising far-away sun, and the pale moons nearing the\r\nhorizon in the west, seemed connected by the huge bow of light.\r\nThe snow on the dark evergreens produced a contrast of colour,\r\nwhile the other trees raised their almost bare and whitened\r\nbranches against the sky, as though in supplication to the\r\nmysterious rings, which cast their light upon them and on the\r\nground.  As they gazed, however, the rings became grey, the moons\r\ndisappeared, and another day began.  Feeling sure the snow must\r\nhave cleared the air of any deleterious substances it contained\r\nthe day before, they descended into the neighbouring valley,\r\nwhich, having a southerly exposure, was warm in comparison with\r\nthe hills.  As they walked they disturbed a number of small\r\nrodents, which quickly ran away and disappeared in their holes.\r\n\r\n"Though we have seen none of the huge creatures here," said\r\nCortlandt, "that were so plentiful on Jupiter, these burrowers\r\nbelong to a distinctly higher scale than those we found there,\r\nfrom which I take it we may infer that the evolution of the\r\nanimal kingdom has advanced further on this planet than on\r\nJupiter, which is just what we have a right to expect; for\r\nSaturn, in addition to being the smaller and therefore more\r\nmatured of the two, has doubtless had a longer individual\r\nexistence, being the farther from the sun."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the cold of the night, the flowers, especially\r\nthe lilies, were as beautiful as ever, which surprised them not a\r\nlittle, until, on examining them closely, they found that the\r\nstems and veins in the leaves were fluted, and therefore elastic,\r\nso that, should the sap freeze, it could expand without bursting\r\nthe cells, thereby enabling the flowers to withstand a short\r\nfrost.  They noticed that many of the curiously shaped birds they\r\nsaw at a distance from time to time were able to move with great\r\nrapidity along the ground, and had about concluded that they must\r\nhave four legs, being similar to winged squirrels, when a long,\r\nlow quadruped, about twenty-five feet from nostrils to tail,\r\nwhich they were endeavouring to stalk, suddenly spread two pairs\r\nof wings, flapping the four at once, and then soared off at great\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n"I hope we can get one of those, or at least his photograph,"\r\nsaid Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"If they go in pairs," said Bearwarden, "we may find the\r\ncompanion near."\r\n\r\nAt that moment another great winged lizard, considerably larger\r\nthan the first, rose with a snort, not twenty yards on their\r\nleft.  Cortlandt, who was a good shot with a gun at short range,\r\nimmediately raised his twelve-bore and fired both barrels at the\r\nmonster; but the double-B shots had no more disabling effect than\r\nif they had been number eights.  They, however, excited the\r\ncreature\'s ire; for, sweeping around quickly, it made straight\r\nfor Cortlandt, breathing at him when near, and almost\r\noverpowering the three men with the malodorous, poisonous cloud\r\nit exhaled.  Instantly Bearwarden fired several revolver bullets\r\ndown its throat, while Ayrault pulled both barrels almost\r\nsimultaneously, with the muzzles but a few inches from its side.\r\nIn this case the initial velocity of the heavy buckshot was so\r\ngreat, and they were still so close together, that they\r\npenetrated the leathery hide, tearing a large hole.  With a roar\r\nthe wounded monster beat a retreat, first almost prostrating them\r\nwith another blast of its awful breath.\r\n\r\n"It would take a stronger light than we get here," said\r\nBearwarden, "to impress a negative through that haze.  I think,"\r\nhe continued, "I know a trick that will do the business, if we\r\nsee any more of these dragons."  Saying which, he withdrew the\r\ncartridges from his gun, and with his hunting-knife cut the tough\r\npaper shell nearly through between the wads separating the powder\r\nfrom the shot, drawing his knife entirely around.\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, "when I fire those, the entire forward end of the\r\ncartridge will go out, keeping the fifteen buckshot together like\r\na slug, and with such penetration that it will go through a\r\ntwo-inch plank.  It is a trick I learned from hunters, and,\r\nunless your guns are choke-bore, in which case it might burst the\r\nbarrel, I advise you to follow suit."\r\n\r\nFinding they had brought straight-bored guns, they arranged their\r\ncartridges similarly, and set out in the direction in which the\r\nwinged lizards or dragons had gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                  A PROVIDENTIAL INTERVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe valley narrowed as they advanced, the banks rising gently on\r\nboth sides.  Both dragons had flown straight to a grove of tall,\r\nspreading trees.  On coming near to this, they noticed a faint\r\nsmell like that of the dragon, and also like the trace they found\r\nin the air on leaving the Callisto the day before, after they had\r\nsought safety within it.  Soon it almost knocked them down.\r\n\r\n"We must get to windward," said Cortlandt.  "I already feel\r\nfaint, and believe those dragons could kill a man by breathing on\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they skirted around the grove, and having made a\r\nquarter circle--for they did not wish the dragons to wind\r\nthem--again drew nearer.  Tree after tree was passed, and finally\r\nthey saw an open space twelve or fifteen acres in area at the\r\ncentre of the grove, when they were arrested by a curious sound\r\nof munching.  Peering among the trunks of the huge trees, they\r\nadvanced cautiously, but stopped aghast.  In the opening were at\r\nleast a hundred dragons devouring the toadstools with which the\r\nground was covered.  Many of them were thirty to forty feet long,\r\nwith huge and terribly long, sharp claws, and jaws armed with\r\ngleaming batteries of teeth.  Though they had evidently lungs,\r\nand the claws and mouth of an animal, they reminded the observers\r\nin many respects of insects enormously exaggerated, for their\r\nwings, composed of a sort of transparent scale, were small, and\r\nmoved, as they had already seen, at far greater speed than those\r\nof a bird.  Their projecting eyes were also set rigidly in their\r\nheads instead of turning, and consisted of a number of flat\r\nsurfaces or facets, like a fly\'s eye, so that they could see\r\nbackward and all around, each facet seeing anything the rays from\r\nwhich came at right angles to its surface.  This beautiful grove\r\nwas doubtless their feeding-ground, and, as such, was likely to\r\nbe visited by many more.  Concluding it would be wise to let\r\ntheir wounded game escape, the three men were about to retreat,\r\nhaving found it difficult to breathe the air even at that\r\ndistance from the monsters, when the wounded dragon that they had\r\nobserved moving about in a very restless manner, and evidently\r\nsuffering a good deal from the effect of its wounds, espied them,\r\nand, with a roar that made the echoes ring, started towards them\r\nslowly along the ground, followed by the entire herd, the nearer\r\nof which now also saw them.  Seeing that their lives were in\r\ndanger, the hunters quickly regained the open, and then stretched\r\ntheir legs against the wind.  The dragons came through the trees\r\non the ground, and then, raising themselves by their wings, the\r\nwhole swarm, snorting, and darkening the air with their deadly\r\nbreath, made straight for the men, who by comparison looked like\r\nLilliputians.  With the slug from his right barrel Bearwarden\r\nended the wounded dragon\'s career by shooting him through the\r\nhead, and with his left laid low the one following.  Ayrault also\r\nkilled two huge monsters, and Cortlandt killed one and wounded\r\nanother.  Their supply of prepared cartridges was then exhausted,\r\nand they fell back on their revolvers and ineffective spreading\r\nshot.  Resolved to sell their lives dearly, they retreated,\r\nkeeping their backs to the wind, with the poisonous dragons in\r\nfront.  But the breeze was very slight, and they were being\r\nrapidly blinded and asphyxiated by the loathsome fumes, and\r\ndeafened by the hideous roaring and snapping of the dragons\'\r\njaws.  Realizing that they could not much longer reply to the\r\ndiabolical host with lead, they believed their last hour had\r\ncome, when the ground on which they were making their last stand\r\nshook, there was a rending of rocks and a rush of imprisoned\r\nsteam that drowned even the dragons\' roar, and they were\r\nseparated from them by a long fissure and a wall of smoke and\r\nvapour.  Struggling back from the edge of the chasm, they fell\r\nupon the ground, and then for the first time fully realized that\r\nthe earthquake had saved them, for the dragons could not come\r\nacross the opening, and would not venture to fly through the\r\nsmoke and steam.  When they recovered somewhat from the shock,\r\nthey cut a number of cartridges in the same way that they had\r\nprepared those that had done them such good service, and kept one\r\nbarrel of each gun loaded with that kind.\r\n\r\n"We may thank Providence," said Bearwarden, "for that escape.  I\r\nhope we shall have no more such close calls."\r\n\r\nWith a parting glance at the chasm that had saved their lives,\r\nand from which a cloud still arose, they turned slightly to the\r\nright of their former course and climbed the gently rising bank.\r\nWhen near the top, being tired of their exciting experiences,\r\nthey sat down to rest.  The ground all about them was covered\r\nwith mushrooms, white on top and pink underneath.\r\n\r\n"This is a wonderful place for fungi," said Ayrault.  "Here,\r\ndoubtless, we shall be safe from the dragons, for they seemed to\r\nprefer the toadstools."  As he lay on the ground he watched one\r\nparticular mushroom that seemed to grow before his eyes.\r\nSuddenly, as he looked, it vanished.  Dumfounded at this\r\nunmistakable manifestation of the phenomenon they thought they\r\nhad seen on landing, he called his companions, and, choosing\r\nanother mushroom, the three watched it closely.  Presently,\r\nwithout the least noise or commotion, that also disappeared,\r\nleaving no trace, and the same fate befell a number of others.\r\nAt a certain point of their development they vanished as\r\ncompletely as a bubble of air coming to the surface of water,\r\nexcept that they caused no ripple, leaving merely a small\r\ndepression where they had stood.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bearwarden, "in all my travels I never have seen\r\nanything like this.  If I were at a sleight-of-hand performance,\r\nand the prestidigitateur, after doing that, asked for my theory,\r\nI should say, \'I give it up.\'  How is it with you, doctor?" he\r\nasked, addressing Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"There must be an explanation," replied Cortlandt, "only we do\r\nnot know the natural law to which the phenomenon is subject,\r\nhaving had no experience with it on earth.  We know that all\r\nsubstances can be converted into gases, and that all gases can be\r\nreduced to liquids, and even solids, by the application of\r\npressure and cold.  If there is any way by which the visible\r\nsubstance of these fungi can be converted into its invisible\r\ngases, as water into oxygen and hydrogen, what we have seen can\r\nbe logically explained.  Perhaps, favoured by some affinity of\r\nthe atmosphere, its constituent parts are broken up and become\r\ngases at this barometric pressure and temperature.  We must ask\r\nthe spirit, if he visits us again."\r\n\r\n"I wish he would," said Ayrault; "there are lots of things I\r\nshould like to ask him."\r\n\r\n"Presidents of corporations and other chairmen," said Bearwarden,\r\n"are not usually superstitious, and I, of course, take no stock\r\nin the supernatural; but somehow I have a well-formed idea that\r\nour friend the bishop, with the great power of his mind over\r\nmatter, had a hand in that earthquake.  He seems to have an\r\nexalted idea of our importance, and may be exerting himself to\r\nmake things pleasant."\r\n\r\nAt this point the sun sank below the horizon, and they found\r\nthemselves confronted with night.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" said Bearwarden, "and we haven\'t a crumb to eat.\r\nI\'ll stand the drinks and the pipes," he continued, passing\r\naround his ubiquitous flask and tobacco-pouch.\r\n\r\n"If I played such pranks with my interior on earth," said\r\nCortlandt, helping himself to both, "as I do on this planet, it\r\nwould give me no end of trouble, but here I seem to have the\r\ndigestion of an ostrich."\r\n\r\nSo they sat and smoked for an hour, till the stars twinkled and\r\nthe rings shone in their glory.\r\n\r\n "Well," said Ayrault, finally, "since we have nothing but\r\nmotions to lay on the table, I move we adjourn."\r\n\r\n"The only motion I shall make," said Cortlandt, who was already\r\nundressed, "will be that of getting into bed," saying which, he\r\nrolled himself in his blanket and soon was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHaving decided that, on account of the proximity of the dragons,\r\na man must in any event be on the watch, they did not set the\r\nprotection-wires.  From the shortness of the nights, they divided\r\nthem into only two watches of from two hours to two and a half\r\neach, so that, even when constant watch duty was necessary, each\r\nman had one full night\'s sleep in three.  On this occasion\r\nAyrault and Cortlandt were the watchers, Cortlandt having the\r\nmorning and Ayrault the evening watch.  Many curious quadruped\r\nbirds, about the size of large bears, and similar in shape,\r\nhaving bear-shaped heads, and several creatures that looked like\r\nthe dragons, flew about them in the moonlight; but neither\r\nwatcher fired a shot, as the creatures showed no desire to make\r\nan attack.  All these species seemed to belong to the owl or bat\r\ntribe, for they roamed abroad at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                        AYRAULT\'S VISION.\r\n\r\nWhen Ayrault\'s watch was ended, he roused Cortlandt, who took his\r\nplace, and feeling a desire for solitude and for a last long look\r\nat the earth, he crossed the top of the ridge on the slope of\r\nwhich they had camped, and lay down on the farther side.  The\r\nSouth wind in the upper air rushed along in the mighty whirl,\r\noccasionally carrying filmy clouds across the faces of the moons;\r\nbut about Ayrault all was still, and he felt a quiet and serene\r\nrepose.  He had every intention of remaining awake, and was\r\npondering on the steadfastness of the human heart and the\r\nconstancy of love, when his meditations began to wander, and,\r\nwith his last thoughts on Sylvia, he fell asleep.  Not a branch\r\nmoved, nor did a leaf fall, yet before Ayrault\'s, sleeping eyes a\r\nstrange scene was enacted.  A figure in white came near and stood\r\nbefore him, and he recognized in it one Violet Slade, a very\r\nattractive girl to whom he had been attentive in his college\r\ndays.  She was at that time just eighteen, and people believed\r\nthat she loved him, but for some reason, he knew not why, he had\r\nnot proposed.\r\n\r\n"I thought you had died," he said, as she gazed at him, "but you\r\nare now looking better than ever."\r\n\r\n"From the world\'s point of view I AM dead," she replied.  "I died\r\nand was buried.  It is therefore permissible that I should show\r\nyou the truth.  You never believed I loved you.  I have wished\r\nearnestly to see you, and to have you know that I did."\r\n\r\n"I did you an injustice," Ayrault answered, perceiving all that\r\nwas in her heart.  "Could mortals but see as spirits do, there\r\nwould be no misunderstandings."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see you," she continued, "and to know you are\r\nwell.  Had you not come here, we could probably not have met\r\nuntil after your death; for I shall not be sufficiently advanced\r\nto return to earth for a long time, though my greatest solace\r\nwhile there was my religion, which is all that brought me here.\r\nWe, however, know that as our capacity for true happiness\r\nincreases we shall be happier, and that after the resurrection\r\nthere will be no more tears.  Farewell," she whispered, while her\r\neyes were filled with love.\r\n\r\nAyrault\'s sleep was then undisturbed for some time, when suddenly\r\nan angel, wreathed in light, appeared before him and spoke these\r\nwords:  "He that walked with Adam and talked with Moses has sent\r\nme to guard you while you sleep.  No plague or fever, wild beast\r\nor earthquake, can molest you, for you are equally protected from\r\nthe most powerful monster and the most insidious disease-germ.\r\n\'Blessed is the man whose offences are covered and whose sins are\r\nforgiven.\'  Sleep on, therefore, and be refreshed, for the body\r\nmust have rest."\r\n\r\n"A man may rest indeed," replied Ayrault, "when he has a guardian\r\nangel.  I had the most unbounded faith in your existence before I\r\nsaw you, and believe and know that you or others have often\r\nshielded me from danger and saved my life.  Why am I worthy of so\r\nmuch care?"\r\n\r\n"\'Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Most High shall abide\r\nunder the shadow of the Almighty,\'" answered the angel, and\r\nthereupon he became invisible, a diffused light taking his place.\r\nShortly afterwards this paled and completely vanished.\r\n\r\n"Not only am I in paradise," thought Ayrault; "I believe I am\r\nalso in the seventh heaven.  Would I might hear such words\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\nA group of lilies then appeared before the sleeper\'s eyes.  In\r\nthe midst was one lily far larger than the rest, and of a\r\ndazzling white.  This spoke in a gentle voice, but with the tones\r\nof a trombone:\r\n\r\n"Thy thoughts and acts are a pleasure to me.  Thou hast raised no\r\nidols within thy heart, and thy faith is as incense before me.\r\nThy name is now in the Book of Life.  Continue as thou hast\r\nbegun, and thou shalt live and reign forever."\r\n\r\nHereupon the earth shook, and Ayrault was awakened.  Great\r\nboulders were rolling and crashing down the slope about him,\r\nwhile the dawn was already in the east.\r\n\r\n"My mortal eyes and senses are keener here while I sleep than\r\nwhen I wake," he thought, as he looked about him, "for spirits,\r\nunable to affect me while waking, have made themselves felt in my\r\nmore sensitive state while I was asleep.  Nevertheless, this is\r\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\r\n\r\n"The boulders were still in motion when I opened my eyes," he\r\nmused; "can it be that there is hereabouts such a flower as in my\r\ndreams I seemed to see?" and looking beyond where his head had\r\nlain, he beheld the identical lily surrounded by the group that\r\nhis closed eyes had already seen.  Thereupon he uncovered his\r\nhead and departed quickly.  Crossing the divide, he descended to\r\ncamp, where he found Cortlandt in deep thought.\r\n\r\n"I cannot get over the dreams," said the doctor, "I had in the\r\nfirst part of the night.  Notwithstanding yesterday\'s excitement\r\nand fatigue, my sleep was most disturbed, and I was visited by\r\nvisions of my wife, who died long ago.  She warned me against\r\nskepticism, and seemed much distressed at my present spiritual\r\nstate."\r\n\r\n"I," said Bearwarden, who had been out early, and had succeeded\r\nin bringing in half a dozen birds, "was so disturbed I could not\r\nsleep.  It seemed to me as though half the men I have ever known\r\ncame and warned me against agnosticism and my materialistic\r\ntendencies.  They kept repeating, \'You are losing the reality for\r\nthe shadow.\'"\r\n\r\n"I am convinced," said Ayrault, "that they were not altogether\r\ndreams, or, if dreams indeed, that they were superinduced by a\r\nhigher will.  We know that angels have often appeared to men in\r\nthe past.  May it not be that, as our appreciativeness increases,\r\nthese communications will recur?"  Thereupon he related his own\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n"The thing that surprised me," said Cortlandt, as they finished\r\nbreakfast, "was the extraordinary realism of the scene.  We must\r\nsee if our visions return on anything but an empty stomach."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                A GREAT VOID AND A GREAT LONGING.\r\n\r\nResuming their march, the travellers proceeded along the\r\ncircumference of a circle having a radius of about three miles,\r\nwith the Callisto in the centre.  In crossing soft places they\r\nobserved foot-prints forming in the earth all around them.  The\r\nimpressions were of all sizes, and ceased when they reached\r\nrising or hard ground, only to reappear in the swamps, regulating\r\ntheir speed by that of the travellers. The three men were greatly\r\nsurprised at this.\r\n\r\n"You may observe," said Cortlandt, "that the surface of the\r\nimpression is depressed as you watch it, as though by a weight,\r\nand you can see, and even hear, the water being squeezed out,\r\nthough whatever is doing it is entirely invisible.  They must be\r\nmade by spirits sufficiently advanced to have weight, but not\r\nadvanced enough to make themselves visible."\r\n\r\nMoved by a species of vandalism, Bearwarden raised his\r\ntwelve-bore, and fired an ordinary cartridge that he had not\r\nprepared for the dragons, at the space directly over the nearest\r\nforming prints.  There was a brilliant display of prismatic\r\ncolours, as in a rainbow, and though the impressions already made\r\nremained, no new ones were formed.\r\n\r\n"Now you have done it!" said Cortlandt.  "I hoped to be able to\r\ninvestigate this further."\r\n\r\n"We shall doubtless see other and perhaps more wonderful things,"\r\nreplied Bearwarden.  "I must say this gives me an uncanny\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\nWhen they had completed a little over half their circle, they\r\ncame upon another of the groves with which Saturn seemed to\r\nabound, at the edge of which, in a side-hill, was a cave, the\r\nentrance of which was composed of rocky masses that had\r\napparently fallen together, the floor being but little higher\r\nthan the surface outside.  The arched roof of the vestibule was\r\nrendered watertight by the soil that had formed upon it, which\r\nagain was overgrown by vines and bushes.\r\n\r\n"This," said Bearwarden, "will be a good place to camp, for the\r\ncave will protect us from dragons, unless they should take a\r\nnotion to breathe at us from the outside, and it will keep us dry\r\nin case of rain.  To-morrow we can start with this as a centre,\r\nand make another circuit."\r\n\r\n"We can explore Saturn on foot," said Cortlandt, "and far more\r\nthoroughly than Jupiter, on account of its comparative freedom\r\nfrom monsters.  Not even the dragons can trouble us, unless we\r\nmeet them in large numbers."\r\n\r\nThereupon they set about getting fuel for their fire.  Besides\r\ncollecting some of the dead wood that was lying all about, they\r\nsplit up a number of resinous pine and fir trees with explosive\r\nbullets from their revolvers, so that soon they not only had a\r\nroaring fire, but filled the back part of the cave with logs to\r\ndry, in case they should camp there again at some later day.\r\nNeither Cortlandt nor Bearwarden felt much like sleeping, and so,\r\nafter finishing the birds the president had brought down that\r\nmorning, they persuaded Ayrault to sit up and smoke with them.\r\nWrapping themselves in their blankets--for there was a chill in\r\nthe air--they sat about the camp-fire they had built in the mouth\r\nof the cave.  Two moons that were at the full rose rapidly in the\r\nclear, cold sky.  On account of their distance from the sun, they\r\nwere less bright than the terrestrial moon, but they shone with a\r\nmarvellously pure pale light.  The larger contained the exact\r\nfeatures of a man.  There was the somewhat aquiline nose, a\r\nclear-cut and expressive mouth, and large, handsome eyes, which\r\nwere shaded by well- marked eyebrows.  The whole face was very\r\nstriking, but was a personification of the most intense grief.\r\nThe expression was indeed sadder than that of any face they had\r\never seen.  The other contained the profile of a surpassingly\r\nbeautiful young woman.  The handsome eyes, shaded by lashes,\r\nlooked straight ahead.  The nose was perfect, and the ear small,\r\nwhile the hair was artistically arranged at the top and back of\r\nthe head.  This moon also reflected a pure white ray.  The former\r\nappeared about once and a quarter, the latter but three quarters,\r\nthe size of the terrestrial moon, and the travellers immediately\r\nrecognized them by their sizes and relative positions as Tethys\r\nand Dione, discovered by J. D. Cassini in March, 1684.  The sad\r\nface was turned slightly towards that of its companion, and it\r\nlooked as if some tale of the human heart, some romance, had been\r\nengraved and preserved for all time on the features of these dead\r\nbodies, as they silently swung in their orbits forever and anon\r\nwere side by side.\r\n\r\n"In all the ages," said Cortlandt, "that these moons have\r\nwandered with Saturn about the sun, and with the solar system in\r\nits journey through space, they can never have gazed upon the\r\nscene they now behold, for we may be convinced that no mortal man\r\nhas been here before."\r\n\r\n"We may say," said Ayrault, "that they see in our bodies a type\r\nof the source from which come all the spiritual beings that are\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"If, as the writers of mythology supposed," replied Cortlandt,\r\n"inanimate objects were endowed with senses, these moons would\r\ndoubtless be unable to perceive the spiritual beings here; for\r\nthe satellites, being material, should, to be consistent, have\r\nonly those senses possessed by ourselves, so that to them this\r\nplanet would ordinarily appear deserted."\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad," said Bearwarden, gloomily, "when those moons\r\nwane and are succeeded by their fellows, for one would give me an\r\nattack of the blues, while the other would subject me to the\r\ninconvenience of falling in love."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the upper branches of the trees in the grove began\r\nto sway as a cold gust from the north sighed among them.  "Lose\r\nno more opportunities," it seemed to cry, "for life is short and\r\nuncertain.  Soon you will all be colder than I, and your future,\r\nstill as easily moulded as clay, will be set as Marpesian marble,\r\nmore fixed than the hardest rock."\r\n\r\n"Paradise," said Cortlandt, "contains sights and sounds that\r\nmight, I should think, arouse sad reminiscences without the aid\r\nof the waters of Lethe, unless the joy of its souls in their new\r\nresources and the sense of forgiveness outweigh all else."\r\n\r\nWith a parting look at the refined, silvery moon, and its\r\nsorrow-laden companion, they retired to the sheltering cave,\r\npiled up the fire, and talked on for an hour.\r\n\r\n"I do not see how it is," said Bearwarden, "that these moons,\r\nconsidering their distance from the sun, and the consequently\r\nsmall amount of light they receive, are so bright."\r\n\r\n"A body\'s brightness in reflecting light," replied Cortlandt,\r\n"depends as much on the colour and composition of its own surface\r\nas on the amount it receives.  It is conceivable that these\r\nmoons, if placed at the earth\'s distance from the sun, would be\r\nfar brighter than our moon, and that our familiar satellite, if\r\nremoved to Saturn, would seem very dim.  We know how much more\r\nbrilliant a mountain in the sunlight is when clad in snow than\r\nwhen its sides are bare.  These moons evidently reflect a large\r\nproportion of the light they receive."\r\n\r\nWhen they came out shortly after midnight the girl\'s-face moon\r\nhad already set, leaving a dark and dreary void in the part of\r\nthe sky it had so ideally filled.  The inexpressibly sad\r\nsatellite (on account of its shorter distance and more rapid rate\r\nof revolution) was still above the horizon, and, being slightly\r\ntilted, had a more melancholy, heart-broken look than before.\r\nWhile they gazed sadly at the emptiness left by Dione, Cortlandt\r\nsaw Ayrault\'s expression change, and, not clearly perceiving its\r\ncause, said, wishing to cheer him:  "Never mind, Dick; to-morrow\r\nnight we shall see it again."\r\n\r\n"Ah, prosaic reasoner," retorted Bearwarden, who saw that this,\r\nlike so many other things, had reminded Ayrault of Sylvia, "that\r\nis but small consolation for having lost it now, though I suppose\r\nour lot is not so hard as if we were never to see it again.  In\r\nthat moon\'s face I find the realization of my fancied ideal\r\nwoman; while that sad one yonder seems as though some celestial\r\nlover, in search of his fate, had become enamoured of her, and\r\ntried in vain to win her, and the grief in his mind had impressed\r\nitself on the then molten face of a satellite to be the monument\r\nthroughout eternity of love and a broken heart.  If the spirits\r\nand souls of the departed have any command of matter, why may not\r\ntheir intensest thoughts engrave themselves on a moon that, when\r\ndead and frozen, may reflect and shine as they did, while\r\nimmersed in the depths of space?  At first Dione bored me; now I\r\nshould greatly like to see her again."\r\n\r\n"History repeats itself," replied Cortlandt, "and the same phases\r\nof life recur.  It is we that are in a changed receptive mood.\r\nThe change that seems to be in them is in reality in us.  Remain\r\nas you are now, and Dione will give you the same pleasure\r\ntomorrow that she gave to-day."\r\n\r\nTo Ayrault this meant more than the mere setting to rise again of\r\na heavenly body.  The perfume of a flower, the sighing of the\r\nwind, suggesting some harmony or song, a full or crescent moon,\r\nrecalled thoughts and associations of Sylvia.  Everything seemed\r\nto bring out memory, and he realized the utter inability of\r\nabsence to cure the heart of love.  "If Sylvia should pass from\r\nmy life as that moon has left my vision," his thoughts continued,\r\n"existence would be but sadness and memory would be its cause,\r\nfor the most beautiful sounds entail sorrow; the most beautiful\r\nsights, intense pain.  "Ah," he went on with a trace of\r\nbitterness,  while his friends fell asleep in the cave, "I might\r\nbetter have remained in love with science; for whose studies\r\nNature, which is but a form of God, in the right spirit, is not\r\ndependent for his joy or despair on the whims of a girl.  She, of\r\ncourse, sees many others, and, being only twenty, may forget me.\r\nMust I content myself with philosophical rules and mathematical\r\nformulae, when she, whose changefulness I may find greater than\r\nthe winds that sigh over me, now loves me no longer?  O love,\r\nwhich makes us miserable when we feel it, and more miserable\r\nstill when it is gone!"\r\n\r\nHe strung a number of copper wires at different degrees of\r\ntension between two trees, and listened to the wind as it ranged\r\nup and down on this improvised AEolian harp.  It gradually ran\r\ninto a regular refrain, which became more and more like words.\r\nAyrault was puzzled, and then amazed.  There could be no doubt\r\nabout it.  "You should be happy," it kept repeating--"you should\r\nbe happy," in soft musical tones.\r\n\r\n"I know I should," replied Ayrault, finally recognizing the voice\r\nof Violet Slade in the song of the wind, "and I cannot understand\r\nwhy I am not.  Tell me, is this paradise, Violet, or is it not\r\nrather purgatory?"\r\n\r\nThe notes ranged up and down again, and he perceived that she was\r\ncausing the wind to blow as she desired--in other words, she was\r\nmaking it play upon his harp.\r\n\r\n"That depends on the individual," she replied. "It is rather\r\nsheol, the place of departed spirits.  Those whose consciences\r\nmade them happy on earth are in paradise here; while those good\r\nenough to reach heaven at last, but in whom some dross remains,\r\nare further refined in spirit, and to them it is purgatory.\r\nThose who are in love can be happy in but one way while their\r\nlove lasts.  What IS happiness, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"It is the state in which desires are satisfied, my fair Violet,"\r\nanswered Ayrault.\r\n\r\n"Say, rather, the state in which desire coincides with duty,"\r\nreplied the song.  "Self-sacrifice for others gives the truest\r\njoy; being with the object of one\'s love, the next.  You never\r\nbelieved that I loved you.  I dissembled well; but you will see\r\nfor yourself some day, as clearly as I see your love for another\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Ayrault, sadly, "I am in love.  I have no reason\r\nto believe there is cause for my unrest, and, considering every\r\nthing, I should be happy as man can be; yet, mirabile dictu, I am\r\nin--hades, in the very depths!"\r\n\r\n"Your beloved is beyond my vision; your heart is all I can see.\r\nYet I am convinced she will not forget you.  I am sure she loves\r\nyou still."\r\n\r\n"I have always believed in homoeopathy to the extent of the\r\nsimilia similibus curantur, Violet, and it is certain that where\r\nnothing else will cure a man of love for one woman, his love for\r\nanother will.  You can see how I love Sylvia, but you have never\r\nseemed so sweet to me as to-day."\r\n\r\n"It is a sacrilege, my friend, to speak so to me now.  You are\r\ndone with me forever.  I am but a disembodied spirit, and escaped\r\nhades by the grace of the Omnipotent, rather than by virtue of\r\nany good I did on earth.  So far as any elasticity is left in my\r\nopportunities, I am dead as yon moon.  You have still the gift\r\nthat but one can give.  Within your animal body you hold an\r\nimmortal soul.  It is pliable as wax; you can mould it by your\r\nwill.  As you shape that soul, so will your future be.  It is the\r\nark that can traverse the flood.  Raise it, and it will raise\r\nyou.  It is all there is in yourself.  Preserve that gift, and\r\nwhen you die you will, I hope, start on a plane many thousands of\r\nyears in advance of me.  There should be no more comparison\r\nbetween us than between a person with all his senses and one that\r\nis deaf and blind.  Though you are a layman, you should, with\r\nyour faith and frame of mind, soon be but little behind our\r\nspiritual bishop."\r\n\r\n"I supposed after death a man had rest.  Is he, then, a bishop\r\nstill?"\r\n\r\n"The progress, as he told you, is largely on the old lines.  As\r\nhe stirred men\'s hearts on earth, he will stir their souls in\r\nheaven; and this is no irksome or unwelcome work."\r\n\r\n"You say he WILL do this in heaven.  Is he, then, not there yet?"\r\n\r\n"He was not far from heaven on earth, yet technically none of us\r\ncan be in heaven till after the general resurrection.  Then, as\r\nwe knew on earth, we shall receive bodies, though, as yet,\r\nconcerning their exact nature we know but little more than then.\r\nWe are all in sheol--the just in purgatory and paradise, the\r\nunjust in hell."\r\n\r\n"Since you are still in purgatory, are you unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"No, our state is very happy.  All physical pain is past, and can\r\nnever be felt again.  We know that our evil desires are overcome,\r\nand that their imprints are being gradually erased.  I\r\noccasionally shed an intangible tear, yet for most of those who\r\nstrove to obey their consciences, purgatory, when essential,\r\nthough occasionally giving us a bitter twinge, is a joy-producing\r\nstate.  Not all the glories imaginable or unimaginable could make\r\nus happy, were our consciences ill at ease.  I have advanced\r\nslowly, yet some things are given us at once.  After I realized I\r\nhad irrevocably lost your love, though for a time I had hoped to\r\nregain it, I became very restless; earth seemed a prison, and I\r\nlooked forward to death as my deliverer.  I bore you no malice;\r\nyou had never especially tried to win me; the infatuation--that\r\nof a girl of eighteen--had been all on my side.  I lived five sad\r\nand lonely years, although, as you know, I had much attention.\r\nPeople thought me cold and heartless.  How could I have a heart,\r\nhaving failed to win yours, and mine being broken?  Having lost\r\nthe only man I loved, I knew no one else could replace him, and I\r\nwas not the kind to marry for pique.  People thought me handsome,\r\nbut I felt myself aged when you ceased to call.  Perhaps when you\r\nand she who holds all your love come to sheol, she may spare you\r\nto me a little, for as a spirit my every thought is known; or\r\nperhaps after the resurrection, when I, too, can leave this\r\nplanet, we shall all soar through space together, and we can\r\nstudy the stars as of old."\r\n\r\n"Your voice is a symphony, sweetest Violet, and I love to hear\r\nyour words.  Ah, would you could once more return to earth, or\r\nthat I were an ethereal spirit, that we might commune face to\r\nface!  I would follow you from one end of Shadowland to the\r\nother.  Of what use is life to me, with distractions that draw my\r\nthoughts to earth as gravitation drew my body?  I wish I were a\r\nshade."\r\n\r\n"You are talking for effect, Dick--which is useless here, for I\r\nsee how utterly you are in love."\r\n\r\n"I AM in love, Violet; and though, as I said, I have no reason to\r\ndoubt Sylvia\'s steadfastness and constancy, I am very unhappy.  I\r\nhave always heard that time is a balsam that cures all ills, yet\r\nI become more wretched every day."\r\n\r\n"Do all you can to preserve that love, and it will bring you joy\r\nall your life.  Your happiness is my happiness.  What distresses\r\nyou, distresses me."\r\n\r\nThe tones here grew fainter and seemed about to cease.\r\n\r\n"Before you leave me," cried Ayrault, "tell me how and when I may\r\nsee or hear you again."\r\n\r\n"While you remain on this planet, I shall be near; but beyond\r\nSaturn I cannot go."\r\n\r\n"Yet tell me, Violet, how I may see you?  My love unattained, you\r\nperceive, makes me wretched, while you always gave me calm and\r\npeace.  If I may not kiss the hand I almost asked might be mine,\r\nlet me have but a glance from your sweet eyes, which will comfort\r\nme so much now."\r\n\r\n"If you break the ice in the pool behind you, you shall see me\r\ntill the frame melts."\r\n\r\nAfter this the silence was broken only by the sighing of the wind\r\nin the trees.  The pool had suddenly become covered with ice\r\nseveral inches thick.  Taking an axe, Ayrault hewed out a\r\nparallelogram about three feet by four and set it on end against\r\nthe bank.  The cold grey of morning was already colouring the\r\neast, and in the growing light Ayrault beheld a vision of Violet\r\nwithin the ice.  The face was at about three fourths, and had a\r\ncontemplative air.  The hair was arranged as he had formerly seen\r\nit, and the thoughtful look was strongest in the beautiful grey\r\neyes, which were more serious than of yore.  Ayrault stood\r\nriveted to the spot and gazed.  "I could have been happy with\r\nher," he mused, and to think she is no more!"\r\n\r\nAs drops fell from the ice, tears rose to his eyes.\r\n\r\n      .      .      .      .      .      .      .\r\n\r\n"What a pretty girl!" said Bearwarden to Cortlandt, as they came\r\nupon it later in the day.  "The face seems etched or imprinted by\r\nsome peculiar form of freezing far within the ice."\r\n\r\nThe next morning they again set out, and so tramped, hunted, and\r\ninvestigated with varying success for ten Saturnian days.  They\r\nfound that in the animal and plant forms of life Nature had\r\noften, by some seeming accident, struck out in a course very\r\ndifferent from any on the earth.  Many of the animals were bipeds\r\nand tripeds, the latter arranged in tandem, the last leg being\r\nevidently an enormously developed tail, by which the creature\r\npropelled itself as with a spring.  The quadrupeds had also\r\nsometimes wings, and their bones were hollow, like those of\r\nbirds.  Whether this great motive and lifting power was the\r\nresult of the planet\'s size and the power of gravitation, or\r\nwhether some creatures had in addition the power of developing a\r\ndegree of apergetic repulsion to offset it, as they suspected in\r\nthe case of the boa-constrictor that fell upon Cortlandt on\r\nJupiter, they could not absolutely ascertain.  Life was far less\r\nprolific on Saturn than on Jupiter, doubtless as a result of its\r\ngreater distance from the sun, and of its extremes of climate,\r\nalmost all organic life being driven to the latitudes near the\r\nequator.  There were, as on Jupiter, many variations from the\r\nforms of life to which they were accustomed, and adaptations to\r\nthe conditions in which they found themselves; but, with the\r\nexception of the strange manifestations of spirit life, they\r\nfound the workings of the fundamental laws the same.  Often when\r\nthey woke at night the air was luminous, and they were convinced\r\nthat if they remained there long enough it would be easy to\r\ndevise some telegraphic code of light-flashes by which they could\r\ncommunicate with the spirit world, and so get ideas from the host\r\nof spirits that had already solved the problem of life and death,\r\nbut who were not as yet sufficiently developed to be able to\r\nreturn to the earth.  One day they stopped to investigate what\r\nthey had supposed to be an optical illusion.  They observed that\r\nleaves and other light substances floated several inches above\r\nthe surface of the water in the pools.  On coming to the edge and\r\nmaking tests, they found a light liquid, as invisible as air,\r\nsuperimposed upon the water, with sufficient buoyancy to sustain\r\ndry wood and also some forms of life.  They also observed that\r\ninsects coming close to the surface and apparently inhaling it,\r\nrapidly increased in size and weight, from which they concluded\r\nit must throw off nitrogen, carbon, or some other nourishment in\r\nthe form of gas.  The depth upon the water was unaffected by\r\nrain, which passed through it, but depended rather on the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, from which it was evidently\r\ncondensed.  There seemed also to be a relation between the amount\r\nof this liquid and the activity of the spirits.  Finally, when\r\ntheir ammunition showed signs of running low, they decided to\r\nreturn to the Callisto, go in it to the other side of the planet,\r\nand resume their investigations there.  Accordingly, they set out\r\nto retrace their steps, returning by a course a few miles to one\r\nside of the way they had come, and making the cave their\r\nobjective point.  Arriving there one evening about sunset, they\r\npitched their camp.  The cave was sheltered and comfortable, and\r\nthey made preparation for passing the night.\r\n\r\n"I shall be sorry," said Ayrault, as they sat near their fire,\r\n"to leave this place without again seeing the bishop.  He said we\r\ncould impress him anywhere, but it may be more difficult to do\r\nthat at the antipodes than here."\r\n\r\n"It does seem," said Bearwarden, "as though we should be missing\r\nit in not seeing him again, if that is possible.  Nothing but a\r\npoison-storm brought him the first time, and it is not certain\r\nthat even in such an emergency would he come again uncalled."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Ayrault, "as none of the spirits here are\r\nmalevolent, they would warn us of danger if they could.  The\r\nbishop\'s spirit seems to have been the only one with sufficiently\r\ndeveloped power to reappear as a man.  I therefore suggest that\r\nto-morrow we try to make him feel our thought and bring him to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                   THE SPIRIT\'S SECOND VISIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next morning they concentrated their minds\r\nsimultaneously on the spirit, wishing with all their strength\r\nthat he should reappear.\r\n\r\n"Whether he be far or near," said Ayrault, "he must feel that,\r\nfor we are using the entire force of our\r\nminds."\r\n\r\nShadows began to form, and dancing prismatic colours appeared,\r\nbut as yet there was no sign of the deceased bishop, when\r\nsuddenly he took shape among them, his appearance and\r\ndisappearance being much like that of stereopticon views on the\r\nsheet before a lantern.  He held himself erect, and his\r\nthoughtful, dignified face had the same calm expression it had\r\nworn before.\r\n\r\n"We attracted your attention," said Ayrault, "in the way you said\r\nwe might, because we longed so to see you."\r\n\r\n"Yes," added Bearwarden and Cortlandt, "we felt we MUST see you\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I am always at your service," replied the spirit, "and will\r\nanswer your questions.  With regard to my visibility and\r\ninvisibility"--he continued, with a smile, "for I will not wait\r\nfor you to ask the explanation of what is in your minds--it is\r\nvery simple.  A man\'s soul can never die; a manifestation of the\r\nsoul is the spirit; this has entity, consciousness, and will, and\r\nthese also live forever.  As in the natural or material life, as\r\nI shall call it, will affects the material first.  Thus, a child\r\nhas power to move its hand or a material object, as a toy, before\r\nit can become the medium in a psychological seance.  So it is\r\nhere.  Before becoming visible to your eyes, I, by my will, draw\r\ncertain material substances in the form of gases from the ground,\r\nwater, or air around me.  These take any shape I wish--not\r\nnecessarily that of man, though it is more natural to appear as\r\nwe did on earth--and may absorb a portion of light, and so be\r\nable to cast a shadow or break up the white rays into prismatic\r\ncolours, or they may be wholly invisible.  By an effort of the\r\nwill, then, I combine and condense these gases--which consist\r\nprincipally of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon--into\r\nflesh, blood, water, or anything else.  You have already learned\r\non earth that, by the application of heat, every solid and every\r\nliquid substance, which is solid or liquid simply because of the\r\ntemperature at which you find it, can be expanded into gas or\r\ngases; and that by cold and pressure every gas can be reduced to\r\na liquid or a solid.  On earth the state of a substance, whether\r\nsolid, liquid, or gaseous, depends simply upon those two\r\nconditions.  Here neither thermal nor barometric changes are\r\nrequired, for, by mastering the new natural laws that at death\r\nbecome patent to our senses, we have all the necessary control.\r\nIt requires but an effort of my will to be almost instantly\r\nclothed in human form, and but another effort to rearrange the\r\nmolecules in such a way as to make the envelope visible.  Some\r\nwho have been dead longer, or had a greater natural aptitude than\r\nI, have advanced further, and all are learning; but the\r\ndifference in the rate at which spirits acquire control of\r\npreviously unknown natural laws varies far more than among\r\nindividuals on earth.\r\n\r\n"These forms of organic life do not disintegrate till after\r\ndeath; here in the natural state they break down and dissolve\r\ninto their structural elements in full bloom, as was done by the\r\nfungi.  The poisonous element in the deadly gust, against which I\r\nwarned you, came from the gaseous ingredients of toadstools,\r\nwhich but seldom, and then only when the atmosphere has the\r\ngreatest affinity for them, dissolve automatically, producing a\r\ndeath-spreading wave, against which your meteorological\r\ninstruments in future can warn you.  The slight fall you noticed\r\nin temperature was because the specific heat of these gases is\r\nhigh, and to become gas while in the solid state they had to\r\nwithdraw some warmth from the air.  The fatal breath of the\r\nwinged lizards--or dragons, as you call them--results from the\r\nsame cause, the action of their digestion breaking up the fungus,\r\nwhich does not kill them, because they exhale the poisonous part\r\nin gaseous form with their breath.  The mushrooms dissolve more\r\neasily; the natural separation that takes place as they reach a\r\ncertain stage in their development being precipitated by\r\nconcussion or shock.\r\n\r\n"Having seen that, as on earth, we gain control of the material\r\nfirst, our acquisitiveness then extends to a better understanding\r\nand appreciation of our new senses, and we are continually\r\nfinding new objects of beauty, and new beauties in things we\r\nsupposed we already understood.  We were accustomed on earth to\r\nthe marvellous variety that Nature produced from apparently\r\nsimple means and presented to our very limited senses; here there\r\nis an indescribably greater variety to be examined by vastly\r\nkeener senses.  The souls in hell have an equally keen but\r\ndistorted counterpart of our senses, so that they see in a\r\nmagnified form everything vile in themselves and in each other.\r\nTo their senses only the ugly and hateful side is visible, so\r\nthat the beauty and perfume of a flower are to them as loathsome\r\nas the appearance and fumes of a toadstool.  As evolution and the\r\ntendency of everything to perpetuate itself and intensify its\r\npeculiarities are invariable throughout the universe, these\r\nunhappy souls and ourselves seem destined to diverge more and\r\nmore as time goes on; and while we constantly become happier as\r\nour capacity for happiness increases, their sharpening senses\r\nwill give them a worse and worse idea of each other, till their\r\nmutual repugnance will know no bounds, and of everything\r\nconcerning which they obtain knowledge through their senses.\r\nThus these poor creatures seem to be the victims of circumstances\r\nand the unalterable laws of fate, and were there such a thing as\r\ndeath, their misery would unquestionably finally break their\r\nhearts.  That there will be final forgiveness for the condemned,\r\nhas long been a human hope; but as yet they have experienced\r\nnone, and there is no analogy for it in Nature.\r\n\r\n"But while you have still your earthly bodies and the\r\nopportunities they give you of serving God, you need not be\r\nconcerned about hell; no one on earth, knowing how things really\r\nare, would ever again forsake His ways.  The earthly state is the\r\nmost precious opportunity of securing that for which a man would\r\ngive his all.  Even from the most worldly point of view, a man is\r\nan unspeakable fool not to improve his talents and do good.  What\r\nwould those in sheol not give now for but one day in the flesh on\r\nearth, of which you unappreciatives may still have so many?  The\r\nwell-used opportunities of even one hour might bring joy to those\r\nin paradise forever, and greatly ease the lot of those in hell.\r\nIn doing acts of philanthropy, however, you must remember the\r\ntext of the sermon the doctor of divinity preached to Craniner\r\nand Ridley just before they perished at the stake:  \'Though I\r\ngive my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me\r\nnothing\'--which shows that even good deeds must be performed in\r\nthe proper spirit.\r\n\r\n"A new era is soon to dawn on earth.  Notwithstanding your great\r\nmaterial progress, the future will exceed all the past.  Man will\r\nfind every substance\'s maximum use, thereby vastly increasing his\r\ncomfort.  Then, when advanced in science and reason, with the\r\npower of his senses increased by the delicate instruments that\r\nyou, as the forerunners of the coming man, are already learning\r\nto make, may he cease to be a groveller, like our progenitors the\r\nquadrupeds, and may his thoughts rise to his Creator, who has\r\nbrought him to such heights through all the intricacies of the\r\nway.  Your preparation for the life to come can also be greatly\r\naided by intercourse with those who have already died.  When you\r\nreally want to associate spiritually with us, you can do so; for,\r\nthough perhaps only one in a hundred million can, like me, so\r\nclothe himself as to be again visible to mortal eyes, many of us\r\ncould affect gelatine or extremely sensitive plates that would\r\nshow interruptions in the ultra-violet chemical rays that, like\r\nthe thermal red beyond the visible spectroscope, you know exist\r\nthough you can neither see nor feel them.  Spirits could not\r\naffect the magnetic eye, because magnetism, though immaterial\r\nitself, is induced and affected only by a material substance.\r\nThe impression on the plate, however, like the prismatic colours\r\nyou have already noticed, can be produced by a slight rarefaction\r\nof the hydrogen in the air, so that, though no spirit could be\r\nphotographed as such, a code and language might be established by\r\nmeans of the effect produced on the air by the spirit\'s mind.  I\r\nam so interested in the subject of my disquisition that I had\r\nalmost forgotten that your spirits are still subject to the\r\nrequirements of the body.  Last time I dined with you; let me now\r\nplay the host."\r\n\r\n"We shall be charmed to dine with you," said Ayrault, "and shall\r\nbe only too glad of anything that will keep you with us."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the spirit, "as the tablecloth is laid, we need only\r\nto have something on it.  Let each please hold a corner," he\r\ncontinued, taking one himself with his left hand, while he passed\r\nhis right to his brow.  Soon flakes as of snow began to form in\r\nthe air above, and slowly descended upon the cloth; and, glancing\r\nup, the three men saw that for a considerable height this process\r\nwas going on, the flakes increasing in size as they fell till\r\nthey attained a length of several inches.  When there was enough\r\nfor them all on the table-cloth the shower ceased.  Sitting down\r\non the ground, they began to eat this manna, which had a\r\ndelicious flavour and marvellous purity and freshness.\r\n\r\n"As you doubtless have already suspected," said the spirit, "the\r\nbasis of this in every case is carbon, combined with nitrogen in\r\nits solid form, and with the other gases the atmosphere here\r\ncontains.  You may notice that the flakes vary in colour as well\r\nas in taste, both of which are of course governed by the gas with\r\nwhich the carbon, also in its visible form, is combined.  It is\r\nalmost the same process as that performed by every plant in\r\nwithdrawing carbon from the air and storing it in its trunk in\r\nthe form of wood, which, as charcoal, is again almost pure\r\ncarbon, only in this case the metamorphosis is far more rapid.\r\nThis is perhaps the natural law that Elijah, by God\'s aid,\r\ninvoked in the miracle of the widow\'s cruse, and that produced\r\nthe manna that fed the Israelites in the desert; while apergy\r\ncame in play in the case of the stream that Moses called from the\r\nrock in the wilderness, which followed the descendants of Abraham\r\nover the rough country through which they passed.  In examining\r\nmiracles with the utmost deference, as we have a right to, we see\r\none law running through all.  Even in Christ\'s miracle of\r\nchanging the water to wine, there was a natural law, though only\r\none has dwelt on earth who could make that change, which, from a\r\nchemist\'s standpoint, was peculiarly difficult on account of the\r\nrequired fermentation, which is the result of a developed and\r\nmatured germ.  Many of His miracles, however, are as far beyond\r\nmy small power as heaven is above the earth.  Much of the\r\nsubstance of the loaves and fishes with which He fed the\r\nmultitude--the carbon and nitrogenous products--also came from\r\nthe air, though He could have taken them from many other sources.\r\nThe combination and building up of these in the ordinary way\r\nwould have taken weeks or months, but was performed\r\ninstantaneously by His mighty power."\r\n\r\n"What natural laws are known to you," asked Bearwarden, "that we\r\ndo not understand, or concerning the existence of which we are\r\nignorant?"\r\n\r\n"Most of the laws in the invisible world," said the spirit, "are\r\nthe counterpart or extension of laws that appear on earth, though\r\nyou as yet understand but a small part of those, many not having\r\ncome to your notice.  You, for instance, know that light, heat,\r\nand motion are analogous, and either of the last two can be\r\nconverted into the other; but in practice you produce motion of\r\nthe water molecules by the application of heat, and seldom\r\nreverse it.  One of the first things we master here is the power\r\nto freeze or boil water, by checking the motion of the molecules\r\nin one case, and by increasing it, and their mutual repulsion, in\r\nthe other.  This is by virtue of a simple law, though in this\r\ncase there is no natural manifestation of it on earth with which\r\nto compare it. While knowledge must be acquired here through\r\nstudy, as on earth, the new senses we receive with the awakening\r\nfrom death render the doing so easy, though with only the senses\r\nwe had before it would have been next to impossible.\r\n\r\n"At this moment snow is falling on the Callisto; but this you\r\ncould not know by seeing, and scarcely any degree of evolution\r\ncould develop your sight sufficiently, unassisted by death.  With\r\nyour instruments, however, you could already perceive it,\r\nnotwithstanding the intervening rocks.\r\n\r\n"Your research on earth is the best and most thorough in the\r\nhistory of the race; and could we but give you suggestions as to\r\nthe direction in which to push it, the difference between\r\nyourselves and angels might be but little more than that between\r\nthe number and intensity of the senses and the composition of the\r\nbody.  By the combination of natural laws you have rid yourselves\r\nof the impediment of material weight, and can roam through space\r\nlike spirits, or as Columbus, by virtue of the confidence that\r\ncame with the discovery of the mariner\'s compass, roamed upon and\r\nexplored the sea.  You have made a good beginning, and were not\r\nyour lives so short, and their requirements so peremptory, you\r\nmight visit the distant stars.\r\n\r\n"I will show you the working of evolution.  Life sleeps in\r\nminerals, dreams in plants, and wakes in you.  The rock worn by\r\nfrost and age crumbles to earth and soil.   This enters the\r\nsubstance of the primordial plant, which, slowly rising; produces\r\nthe animal germ.  After that the way is clear, and man is evolved\r\nfrom protoplasm through the vertebrate and the ape.  Here we have\r\nthe epitome of the struggle for life in the ages past, and the\r\nanalogue of the journey in the years to come.  Does not the\r\nAlmighty Himself make this clear where He says through his\r\nservant Isaiah, \'Behold of these stones will I raise up\r\nchildren\'?--and the name Adam means red earth.  God, having\r\nbrought man so far, will not let evolution cease, and the next\r\nstage of life must be the spiritual."\r\n\r\n"Can you tell us anything," asked Ayrault, "concerning the bodies\r\nthat those surviving the final judgment will receive?"\r\n\r\n"Notwithstanding the unfolding of knowledge that has come to us\r\nhere," replied the spirit, "there are still some subjects\r\nconcerning which we must look for information to the inspired\r\nwriters in the Bible, and every gain or discovery goes to prove\r\ntheir veracity.    We know that there are celestial bodies and\r\nbodies  terrestrial, and that the spiritual bodies we shall\r\nreceive in the resurrection will have power and will be\r\nincorruptible and immortal.  We also know by analogy and reason\r\nthat they will be unaffected by the cold and void of space, so\r\nthat their possessors can range through the universe for\r\nnon-nillions and decillions of miles, that they will have\r\nmarvellous capacities for enjoying what they find, and that no\r\nundertaking or journey will be too difficult, though it be to the\r\ncentre of the sun.  Though many of us can already visit the\r\nremote regions of space as spirits, none can as yet see God; but\r\nwe know that as the sight we are to receive with our new bodies\r\nsharpens, the pure in heart will see Him, though He is still as\r\ninvisible to the eyes of the most developed here as the ether of\r\nspace is to yours."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                    CASSANDRA AND COSMOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe water-jug being empty, Ayrault took it up, and, crossing the\r\nridge of a small hill, descended to a running-brook.  He had\r\nfilled it, and was straightening himself, when the stone on which\r\nhe stood turned, and he might have fallen, had not the bishop, of\r\nwhose presence he had been unaware, stretched out his hand and\r\nupheld him.\r\n\r\n"I thought you might need a little help," he said with a smile,\r\n"and so walked beside you, though you knew it not.  Water is\r\nheavy, and you may not yet have become accustomed to its\r\nSaturnian weight."\r\n\r\n"Many thanks, my master," replied Ayrault, retaining his hand.\r\n"Were it not that I am engaged to the girl I love, and am\r\nsometimes haunted by the thought that in my absence she may be\r\nforgetting me, I should wish to spend the rest of my natural life\r\nhere, unless I could persuade you to go with me to the earth."\r\n\r\n"By remaining here," replied the spirit, with a sad look, "you\r\nwould be losing the most priceless opportunities of doing good.\r\nNeither will I go with you; but, as your distress is real, I will\r\ntell you of anything happening on earth that you wish to know."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, then, what the person now in my thoughts is doing."\r\n\r\n"She is standing in a window facing west, watering some\r\nforget-me-nots with a small silver sprinkler which has a ruby in\r\nthe handle."\r\n\r\n"Can you see anything else?"\r\n\r\n"Beneath the jewel is an inscription that runs:\r\n\r\n           \'By those who in warm July are born\r\n            A single ruby should be worn;\r\n            Then will they be exempt and free\r\n            From love\'s doubts and anxiety.\'"\r\n\r\n"Marvellous! Had I any doubts as to your prescience and power,\r\nthey would be dispelled now.  One thing more let me ask, however:\r\nDoes she still love me?"\r\n\r\n"In her mind is but one thought, and in her heart is an\r\nimage--that of the man before me.  She loves you with all her\r\nsoul."\r\n\r\n"My most eager wish is satisfied, and for the moment my heart is\r\nat rest," replied Ayrault, as they turned their steps towards\r\ncamp.  "Yet, such is my weakness by nature, that, ere twenty-four\r\nhours have passed I shall long to have you tell me again."\r\n\r\n"I have been in love myself," replied the spirit, "and know the\r\nfeeling; yet to be of the smallest service to you gives me far\r\nmore happiness than it can give you.  The mutual love in paradise\r\nexceeds even the lover\'s love on earth, for it is only those that\r\nloved and can love that are blessed.\r\n\r\n"You can hardly realize," the bishop continued, as they rejoined\r\nBearwarden and Cortlandt, "the joy that a spirit in paradise\r\nexperiences when, on reopening his eyes after passing death,\r\nwhich is but the portal, he finds himself endowed with sight that\r\nenables him to see such distances and with such distinctness.\r\nThe solar system, with this ringed planet, its swarm of\r\nasteroids, and its intra-Mercurial planets--one of which, Vulcan,\r\nyou have already discovered--is a beautiful sight.  The planets\r\nnearest the sun receive such burning rays that their surfaces are\r\nred-hot, and at the equator at perihelion are molten.  These are\r\nnot seen from the earth, because, rising or setting almost\r\nsimultaneously with the sun, they are lost in its rays.  The\r\ngreat planet beyond Neptune\'s orbit is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting.  This we call Cassandra, because it would be a\r\nprophet of evil to any visitor from the stars who should judge\r\nthe solar system by it.  This planet is nearly as large as\r\nJupiter, being 80,000 miles in diameter, but has a specific\r\ngravity lighter than Saturn.  Bode\'s law, you know, says, Write\r\ndown 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96.  Add 4 to each, and get 4, 7, 10,\r\n16, 28, 52, 100; and this series of numbers represents very\r\nnearly the relative distances of the planets from the sun.\r\nAccording to this law, you would expect the planet next beyond\r\nNeptune to be about 5,000,000,000 miles from the sun.  But it is\r\nabout 9,500,000,000, so that there is a gap between Neptune and\r\nCassandra, as between Mars and Jupiter, except that in\r\nCassandra\'s case there are no asteroids to show where any planet\r\nwas; we must, then, suppose it is an exception to Bode\'s law, or\r\nthat there was a planet that has completely disappeared.  As\r\nCassandra would be within the law if there had been an\r\nintermediary planet, we have good prima facie reason for\r\nbelieving that it existed.  Cassandra takes, in round numbers, a\r\nthousand years to complete its orbit, and from it the sun, though\r\nbrighter, appears no larger than the earth\'s evening or morning\r\nstar.  Cassandra has also three large moons; but these, when\r\nfull, shine with a pale-grey light, like the old moon in the new\r\nmoon\'s arms, in that terrestrial phenomenon when the earth, by\r\nreflecting the crescent\'s light, and that of the sun, makes the\r\ndark part visible.  The temperature at Cassandra\'s surface is but\r\nlittle above the cold of space, and no water exists in the liquid\r\nstate, it being as much a solid as aluminum or glass.  There are\r\nrivers and lakes, but these consist of liquefied hydrogen and\r\nother gases, the heavier liquid collected in deep Places, and the\r\nlighter, with less than half the specific gravity of ether,\r\nfloating upon it without mixing, as oil on water.  When the\r\nheavier penetrates to a sufficient depth, the interior being\r\nstill warm, it is converted into gas and driven back to the\r\nsurface, only to be recondensed on reaching the upper air.  Thus\r\nit may happen that two rains composed of separate liquids may\r\nfall together.  There being but little of any other atmosphere,\r\nmuch of it consists of what you might call the vapour of\r\nhydrogen, and many of the well-known gases and liquids on earth\r\nexist only as liquids and solids; so that, were there mortal\r\ninhabitants on Cassandra, they might build their houses of blocks\r\nof oxygen or chlorine, as you do of limestone or marble, and use\r\nice that never melts, in place of glass, for transparence.  They\r\nwould also use mercury for bullets in their rifles, just as\r\ninhabitants of the intra-Vulcan planets at the other extreme\r\nmight, if their bodies consisted of asbestos, or were in any\r\nother way non-combustibly constituted, bathe in tin, lead, or\r\neven zinc, which ordinarily exist in the liquid state, as water\r\nand mercury do on the earth.\r\n\r\n"Though Cassandra\'s atmosphere, such as it is, is mostly clear,\r\nfor the evaporation from the rivers and icy mediterraneans is\r\nslight, the brightness of even the highest noon is less than an\r\nearthly twilight, and the stars never cease to shine.  The dark\r\nbase of the rocky cliffs is washed by the frigid tide, but there\r\nis scarcely a sound, for the pebbles cannot be moved by the\r\nweightless waves, and an occasional murmur is all that is heard.\r\nGreat rocks of ice reflect the light of the grey moons, and never\r\na leaf falls or a bird sings.  With the exception of the mournful\r\nripples, the planet is silent as the grave.  The animal and plant\r\nkingdoms do not exist; only the mineral and spiritual worlds.  I\r\nsay spiritual, because there are souls upon it; but it is the\r\nhome of the condemned in hell.  Here dwell the transgressors who\r\ndied unrepentant, and those who were not saved by faith.  This is\r\nthe one instance in which I do not enjoy my developed sight, for\r\nI sometimes glance in their direction, and the vision that meets\r\nme, as my eyes focus, distresses my soul.  Their senses are like\r\nan imperfect mirror, magnifying all that is bad in one another,\r\nand distorting anything still partially good when that exists.\r\nAll those things that might at least distract them are hollow,\r\ntheir misery being the inevitable result of the condition of mind\r\nto which they became accustomed on earth and which brought them\r\nto Cassandra.  But let us turn to something brighter.\r\n\r\n"Though the solar system may seem complex, the sun is but a star\r\namong the millions in the Milky Way, and, compared with the\r\nplanetary systems of Sirius, the stars of the Southern Cross, and\r\nthe motions of the nebula, it is simplicity itself.  Compared\r\nwith the splendour of Sirius, with its diameter of twelve million\r\nmiles, the sun, measuring but eight hundred and forty thousand,\r\nbecomes insignificant; and this giant\'s system includes groups\r\nand clusters of planets, many with three times the mass of\r\nJupiter, five and six together, each a different colour,\r\nrevolving about a common centre, while they swing about their\r\nprimary.  Their numerous moons have satellites encircling them,\r\nwith orbits in some cases at right angles to the plane of the\r\necliptic, so that they shine perpendicularly on what correspond\r\nto the arctic and antarctic regions, while their axes are so\r\ninclined that the satellites turn a complete somersault at each\r\nrevolution, producing glistening effects of ice and snow at the\r\npoles.  Some of the moons are at a red or white heat, and so\r\nprevent the chill of night on the planets, while they shine with\r\nmore than reflected light.  In addition to the five or six large\r\nplanets in each group, which, however, are many millions of miles\r\napart, there is in some clusters a small planet that swings\r\nbackward and forward across the common centre, like a pendulum,\r\nbut in nearly a straight line; and while this multiplicity of\r\nmotion goes on, the whole aggregation sweeps majestically around\r\nSirius, its mighty sun.  Our little solar system contains, as we\r\nknow, about one thousand planets, satellites, and asteroids large\r\nenough to be dignified by the name of heavenly bodies.  Vast\r\nnumbers of the stars have a hundred and even a thousand times the\r\nmass of our sun, and their systems being relatively as complex as\r\nours--in some cases even more so--they contain a hundred thousand\r\nor a million individual bodies.\r\n\r\n"Over sixty million bright or incandescent stars were visible to\r\nthe terrestrial telescopes a hundred years ago, the average size\r\nof which far exceeds our sun.  To the magnificent telescopes of\r\nto-day they are literally countless, and the number can be\r\nindefinitely extended as your optical resources grow.  Yet the\r\nnumber of stars you see is utterly insignificant compared with\r\nthe cold and dark ones you cannot see, but concerning which you\r\nare constantly learning more, by observing their effect on the\r\nbright ones, both by perturbing them and by obscuring their rays.\r\nOccasionally, as you know, a star of the twelfth or fifteenth\r\nmagnitude, or one that has been invisible, flares up for several\r\nmonths to the fourth or fifth, through a collision with some dark\r\ngiant, and then returns to what it was in the beginning, a\r\ngaseous, filmy nebula.  These innumerable hosts of dark monsters,\r\nthough dead, are centres of systems, like most of the stars you\r\ncan see.\r\n\r\n"A slight consideration of these figures will show that,\r\nnotwithstanding the number of souls the Creator has given life on\r\nearth, each one might in fact have a system to himself; and that,\r\nhowever long the little globe may remain, as it were, a mint, in\r\nwhich souls are tried by fire and moulded, and receive their\r\nfinal stamp, they will always have room to circulate, and will be\r\nprized according to the impress their faces or hearts must show.\r\nBut Sirius itself is moving many times faster than the swiftest\r\ncannon ball, carrying its system with it; and I see you asking,\r\n\'To what does all this motion tend?\'  I will show you.  Many\r\nquadrillions of miles away, so far that your most powerful\r\ntelescopes have not yet caught a glimmer, rests in its serene\r\ngrandeur a star that we call Cosmos, because it is the centre of\r\nthis universe.  Its diameter is as great as the diameter of\r\nCassandra\'s orbit, and notwithstanding its terrific heat, its\r\nspecific gravity, on account of the irresistible pressure at and\r\nnear the centre, is as great as that of the planet Mercury.  This\r\nholds all that your eyes or mine can see; and the so-called\r\nmotions of the stars--for we know that Sirius, among others, is\r\nreceding--is but the difference in the rate at which the\r\ndifferent systems and constellations swing around Cosmos, though\r\nin doing so they often revolve about other systems or swing round\r\ncommon centres, so that many are satellites of satellites many\r\ntimes repeated.  The orbits of some are circular, and of others\r\nelliptical, as those of comets, and some revolve about each\r\nother, or, as we have seen, about a common point while they\r\nperform their celestial journey.  A star, therefore, recedes or\r\nadvances, as Jupiter and Venus with relation to the earth.  The\r\nplanet in the smaller orbit moves faster than that in the larger,\r\nso that the intervening distances wax and wane, though all are\r\ngoing in the same general direction.  In the case of the members\r\nof the solar system, astronomical record can tell when even a\r\nmost distant known planet has been in opposition or conjunction;\r\nbut the earth has scarcely been habitable since the sun was last\r\nin its present position in its orbit around Cosmos.  The curve\r\nthat our system follows is of such radius that it would require\r\nthe most precise observations for centuries to show that it was\r\nnot a straight line.\r\n\r\n"We call this the universe because it is all that the clearest\r\neyes or telescopes have been able to see, but it is only a\r\nsubdivision--in fact, but a system on a vaster scale than that of\r\nthe sun or of Sirius.  Far beyond this visible universe, my\r\nintuition tells me, are other systems more gigantic than this,\r\nand entirely different in many respects.  Even the effects of\r\ngravitation are modified by the changed condition; for these\r\nsystems are spread out flat, like the rings of this planet, and\r\nthe ether of space is luminous instead of black, as here.  These\r\nsystems are but in a later stage of development than ours; and in\r\nthe course of evolution our visible universe will be changed in\r\nthe same way, as I can explain.\r\n\r\n"In incalculable ages, the forward motion of the planets and\r\ntheir satellites will be checked by the resistance of the ether\r\nof space and the meteorites and solid matter they encounter.\r\nMeteorites also overtake them, and, by striking them as it were\r\nin the rear, propel them, but more are encountered in front--an\r\nillustration of which you can have by walking rapidly or riding\r\non horseback on a rainy day, in which case more drops will strike\r\nyour chest than your back.  The same rule applies to bodies in\r\nspace, while the meteorites encountered have more effect than\r\nthose following, since in one case it is the speed of the meteor\r\nminus that of the planet, and in the other the sum of the two\r\nvelocities.  With this checking of the forward motion, the\r\ncentrifugal force decreases, and the attraction of the central\r\nbody has more effect.  When this takes place the planet or\r\nsatellite falls slightly towards the body around which it\r\nrevolves, thereby increasing its speed till the centrifugal force\r\nagain balances the centripetal.  This would seem to make it\r\ndescend by fits and starts, but in reality the approach is nearly\r\nconstant, so that the orbits are in fact slightly spiral.  What\r\nis true of the planets and satellites is also true of the stars\r\nwith reference to Cosmos; though many even of these have\r\nsubordinate motions in their great journey.  Though the\r\nsatellites of the moons revolve about the primaries in orbits\r\ninclined at all kinds of angles to the planes of the ecliptics,\r\nand even the moons vary in their paths about the planets, the\r\nplanets themselves revolve about the stars, like those of this\r\nsystem about the sun, in substantially the same plane; and what\r\nis true of the planets is even more true of the stars in their\r\norbits about Cosmos, so that when, after incalculable ages, they\r\ndo fall, they strike this monster sun at or near its equator, and\r\nnot falling perpendicularly, but in a line varying but slightly\r\nfrom a tangent, and at terrific speed, they cause the colossus to\r\nrotate more and more rapidly on its own axis, till it must become\r\ngreatly flattened at the poles, as the earth is slightly, and as\r\nJupiter and Saturn are a good deal.  Even though not all the\r\nstars are exactly in the plane of Cosmos\'s equator, as you can\r\nsee they are not there are as many above as below it, so that the\r\ngeneral average will be there; and as all are moving in the same\r\ndirection, it is not necessary for all to strike the same line,\r\nthose striking nearer the poles, where the circles are smaller,\r\nand where the surface is not being carried forward so fast by the\r\ngiant\'s rotation, will have even more effect in increasing its\r\nspeed, since it will be like attaching the driving-rods of a\r\nlocomotive near the axle instead of near the circumference, and\r\nwith enough power will produce even greater results.  As Cosmos\r\nwaxes greater from the result of these continual accretions, its\r\nattraction for the stars will increase, until those coming from\r\nthe outer regions of its universe will move at such terrific\r\nspeed in their spiral orbits that before coming in contact they\r\nwill be almost invisible, having already absorbed all solid\r\nmatter revolving about themselves.  These accessions of moving\r\nmatter, continually received at and near its equator, will cause\r\nCosmos to spread out like Saturn\'s rings till it becomes flat,\r\nthough the balance of forces will be so perfect that it is\r\ndoubtful whether an animal or a man placed there would feel much\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n"But these universes--or, more accurately, divisions of the\r\nuniverse--already planes, though the vast surfaces are not so\r\nflat as to preclude beautiful and gently rolling slopes, are\r\nspirit-lands, and will be inhabited only by spirits.  Then there\r\nare great phosphorescent areas, and the colour of the surface\r\nchanges with every hour of the day, from the most brilliant\r\ncrimson to the softest shade of blue, radiant with many colours\r\nthat your eyes cannot now see.  There are also myriads of scented\r\nstreams, consisting of hundreds of different and multi-coloured\r\nliquids, each with a perfume sweeter than the most delicate\r\nflower, and pouring forth the most heavenly music as they go on\r\ntheir way.  But be not surprised at the magnitude of the change,\r\nfor is it not written in Revelation, \'I saw a new heaven and a\r\nnew earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed\r\naway\'?  Nor can we be surprised at vastness, sublimity, and\r\nbeauty such as never was conceived of, for do we not find this in\r\nHis word, \'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered\r\ninto the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for\r\nthem that love Him\'?  In this blissful state, those that feared\r\nGod and obeyed their consciences will live on forever; but their\r\nrest can never become stagnation, for evolution is one of the\r\nmost constant laws, and never ceases, and they must always go\r\nonward and upward, unspeakably blessed by the consciences they\r\nmade their rule in life, till in purity and power they shall\r\nequal or exceed the angels of their Lord in heaven.\r\n\r\n"But you men of finite understanding will ask, as I myself should\r\nhave asked, How, by the law of hydrostatics, can liquids flow on\r\na plane?  Remember that, though these divisions are astronomical\r\nor geometrical planes, their surfaces undulate; but the moving\r\ncause is this:  At the centre of these planes is a pole, the\r\nanalogue, we will say, of the magnetic pole on earth, that has a\r\nmore effective attraction for a gas than for a liquid.  When\r\nliquids approach the periphery of the circle, the rapid rotation\r\nand decreased pressure cause them to break up, whereupon the\r\nelementary gases return to the centre in the atmosphere, if near\r\nthe surface, forming a gentle breeze.  On nearing the centre, the\r\ncause of the separation being removed, the gases reunite to form\r\na liquid, and the centrifugal force again sends this on its\r\njourney."\r\n\r\n"Is there no way," asked Bearwarden, "by which a man may retrieve\r\nhimself, if he has lost or misused his opportunities on earth?"\r\n\r\n"The way a man lays up treasures in heaven, when on earth,"\r\nreplied the spirit, "is by gladly doing something for some one\r\nelse, usually in some form sacrificing self.  In hell no one can\r\ndo anything for any one else, because every one can have the\r\nsemblance of anything he wishes by merely concentrating his mind\r\nupon it, though, when he has it, it is but a shadow and gives him\r\nno pleasure.  Thus no one can give any one else anything he\r\ncannot obtain himself; and if he could, since it would be no\r\nsacrifice on his part, he would derive no great moral comfort\r\nfrom it.  Neither can any one comfort any one else by putting his\r\nacts or offences in a new light, for every one knows the whole\r\ntruth about himself and everybody else, so that nothing can be\r\nmade to appear favourably or unfavourably.  All this, however, is\r\nsupposing there is the desire to be kind; but how can spirits\r\nthat were selfish and ill-disposed on earth, where there are so\r\nmany softening influences, have good inclinations in hell, where\r\nthey loathe one another with constantly increasing strength?\r\n\r\n"Inasmuch as both the good and the bad continue on the lines on\r\nwhich they started when on earth, we are continually drawing\r\nnearer to God, while they are departing.  The gulf may be only\r\none of feeling, but that is enough.  It follows, then, that with\r\nGod as our limit, which we of course can never reach, their\r\nlimit, in the geometrical sense, must be total separation from\r\nHim.  Though all spirits, we are told, live forever, it occurs to\r\nme that in God\'s mercy there may be a gradual end; for though to\r\nthe happy souls in heaven a thousand years may seem as nothing,\r\nexistence in hell must drag along with leaden limbs, and a single\r\nhour seem like a lifetime of regret.  Since it is dreadful to\r\nthink that such unsoothed anguish should continue forever, I have\r\noften pondered whether it might not be that, by a form of\r\ninvolution and reversal of the past law, the spirit that came to\r\nlife evolved from the, mineral, plant, and animal worlds, may\r\nmercifully retrace its steps one by one, till finally the soul\r\nshall penetrate the solid rock and hide itself by becoming part\r\nof the planet.  Many people in my day believed that after death\r\ntheir souls would enter stately trees, and spread abroad great\r\nbranches, dropping dead leaves over the places on which they had\r\nstood while on earth.  This might be the last step in the awful\r\ntragedy of the fall and involution of a human soul.  In this way,\r\nthose who had wasted the priceless opportunities given them by\r\nGod might be mercifully obliterated, for it seems as if they\r\nwould not be needed in the economy of the universe.  The Bible,\r\nhowever, mentions no such end, and says unmistakably that hell\r\nwill last forever; so that in this supposition, as in many\r\nothers, the wish is probably father of the thought."\r\n\r\n"But," persisted Bearwarden, "how about death-bed repentances?"\r\n\r\n"Those," replied the spirit, "are few and far between.  The pains\r\nof death at the last hour leave but little room for aught but\r\nvain regret.  A man dies suddenly, or may be unconscious some\r\ntime before the end.  But they do occur.  The question is, How\r\nmuch credit is it to be good when you can do no more harm?  The\r\ntime to resist evil and do that which is right is while the\r\ntemptation is on and in its strength.  While life lasts there is\r\nhope, but the books are sealed by death.  The tree must fall to\r\none side or the  other-- there is no middle ground--and as the\r\ntree falleth, so it lieth.\r\n\r\n"This, however, is a gloomy subject, and one that in your heart\r\nof hearts you understand.  I would rather tell you more of the\r\nbeauties and splendours of space--of the orange, red, and blue\r\nstars, and of the tremendous cyclonic movements going on within\r\nthem, which are even more violent than the storms that rage in\r\nthe sun.  The clouds, as the spectroscope has already shown,\r\nconsist of iron, gold, and platinum in the form of vapour, while\r\nthe openings revealed by sun-spots, or rather star-spots, are so\r\ntremendous that a comparatively small one would contain many\r\ndozen such globes as the earth.  I could tell you also of the\r\nmysteries of the great dark companions of some of the stars, and\r\nof the stars that are themselves dark and cold, with naught but\r\nthe faraway constellations to cheer them, on which night reigns\r\neternally, and that far outnumber the stars you can see.  Also of\r\nthe multiplicity of sex and extraordinary forms of life that\r\nexist there, though on none of them are there mortal men like\r\nthose on the earth.\r\n\r\n"Nature, in the process of evolution, has in all these cases gone\r\noff on an entirely different course, the most intelligent and\r\nhighly developed species being in the form of marvellously\r\ncomplex reptiles, winged serpents that sing most beautifully, but\r\nwhose blood is cold, being prevented from freezing in the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere by the presence of salt and chemicals,\r\nand which are so intelligent that they have practically subdued\r\nmany of these dark stars to themselves.  On others, the most\r\nhighly developed species have hollow, bell-shaped tentacles, into\r\nwhich they inject two or more opposing gases from opposite sides\r\nof their bodies, which, in combination, produce a strong\r\nexplosion.  This provides them with an easy and rapid locomotion,\r\nsince the explosions find a sufficient resistance in the\r\nsurrounding air to propel the monsters much faster than birds.\r\nThese can at pleasure make their breath so poisonous that the\r\nlungs of any creatures except themselves inhaling it are at once\r\nturned to parchment.  Others can give their enemies or their prey\r\nan electric shock, sending a bolt through the heart, or can\r\nparalyze the mind physically by an effort of their wills, causing\r\nthe brain to decompose while the victim is still alive.  Others\r\nhave the same power that snakes have, though vastly intensified,\r\nmesmerizing their victims from afar.\r\n\r\n"Still others have such delicate senses that in a way they\r\ncommune with spirits, though they have no souls themselves; for\r\nin no part or corner of the universe except on earth are there\r\nanimals that have souls.  Yet they know the meaning of the word,\r\nand often bewail their hard lot in that no part of them can live\r\nwhen the heart has ceased to beat.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my friends, if we had no souls--if, like the aesthetic\r\nreptilia, we knew that when our dust dissolved our existence\r\nwould be over--we should realize the preciousness of what we hold\r\nso lightly now.  Man and the spirits and angels are the only\r\nbeings with souls, and in no place except on earth are new souls\r\nbeing created.  This gives you the greatest and grandest idea of\r\nthe dignity of life and its inestimable value.  But it is as\r\ndifficult to describe the higher wonders of the stellar worlds to\r\nyou as to picture the glories of sunset to a blind man, for you\r\nhave experienced nothing with which to compare them.  Instead of\r\nseeing all that really is, you see but a small part."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                DOCTOR CORTLANDT SEES HIS GRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Is it not distasteful to you," Cortlandt asked, "to live so near\r\nthese loathsome dragons?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least," replied the spirit.  "They affect us no more\r\nthan the smallest micro-organism, for we see both with equal\r\nclearness.  Since we are not obliged to breathe, they cannot\r\ninjure us; and, besides, they serve to illustrate the working of\r\nGod\'s laws, and there is beauty in everything for those that have\r\nthe senses required for perceiving it.  A feature of the\r\nspiritual world is, that it does not interfere with the natural,\r\nand the natural, except through faith, is not aware of its\r\npresence."\r\n\r\n"Then why," asked Cortlandt, "was it necessary for the Almighty\r\nto bring your souls to Saturn, since there would have been no\r\novercrowding if you had remained on the earth?"\r\n\r\n"That," replied the spirit, "was part of His wisdom; for the\r\nspirit, being able at once to look back into the natural world,\r\nif in it, would be troubled at the mistakes and tribulations of\r\nhis friends.  Now, as a rule, before a spirit can return to\r\nearth, his or her relatives and friends have also died; or, if he\r\ncan return before that happens, he is so advanced that he sees\r\nthe ulterior purpose, and therefore the wisdom of God\'s ways, and\r\nis not distressed thereby.  Lastly, as their expanding senses\r\ngrew, it would be painful for the blessed and condemned spirits\r\nto be together.  Therefore we are brought here, where God reveals\r\nHimself to us more and more, and the flight of the other\r\nsouls--those unhappy ones--does not cease till they reach\r\nCassandra."\r\n\r\n"Can the souls on Cassandra also leave it in time and roam at\r\nwill?" asked Cortlandt.\r\n\r\n"I have seen none of them myself in my journeys to other planets;\r\nbut as the sun shines upon the just and the unjust, and there is\r\nno exception to Nature\'s laws, I can reply that in time they do,\r\nand with equal powers their incentive to roam would be greater;\r\nfor we are drawn together by common sympathy and pure, requited\r\nlove, while they are mutually repelled.  Of course, some obtain a\r\nmeasure of freedom before the rest, and these naturally roam the\r\nfarthest, and the more they see and the farther they go, the\r\nstronger becomes their abhorrence for everything they meet."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you spirits help us, and the mortals now on earth, to\r\nescape this fate?"\r\n\r\n"The greatest hope for your bodies and souls lies in the\r\ncommunion with those that have passed through death; for the\r\nleast of them can tell you more than the wisest man on earth; and\r\ncould you all come or send representatives to the multitudes here\r\nwho cannot as yet return to you, but few on earth would be so\r\nquixotically sinful as to refuse our advice.  Since, however, the\r\ngreatest good comes to men from the learning that they make an\r\neffort to secure, it is for you to strive to reach us, who can\r\nact as go-betweens from God to you."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Bearwarden, "that people are better now\r\nthan formerly.  The sin of idolatry, for instance, has\r\ndisappeared--has it not?"\r\n\r\n"Men still set up idols of wealth, passion, or ambition in their\r\nhearts.  These they worship as in days gone by, only the form has\r\nchanged."\r\n\r\n"Could the souls on Cassandra do us bodily or mental injury, if\r\nwe could ever reach their planet?" asked Bearwarden.\r\n\r\n"They might oppress and distress you, but your faith would\r\nprotect you wherever you might go."\r\n\r\n"Can you give us a taste of your sense of prescience?" asked\r\nBearwarden again; "for, since it is not clear in what degree the\r\ncondemned receive this, and neither is it by any means sure that\r\nI shall be saved, I should like for once in my history to\r\nexperience this sense of divinity, before my entity ends in\r\nstone."\r\n\r\n"I will transfer to you my sense of prescience," replied the\r\nspirit, "that you may foresee as prophets have.  In so doing, I\r\nshall but anticipate, since you will yourselves in time obtain\r\nthis sense in a greater or less degree.  Is there any event in\r\nthe future you would like to see, in order that, when the vision\r\nis fulfilled, it may tend to stablish your faith?"\r\n\r\n"Since I am the oldest," replied the doctor, "and shall probably\r\ndie before my friends, reveal to us, I pray you, the manner of my\r\ndeath and the events immediately following.  This may prove an\r\nobject-lesson to them, and will greatly interest me."\r\n\r\n"Your death will be caused by blood-poisoning, brought on by an\r\naccident," began the spirit.  "Some daybreak will find you weak,\r\nafter a troubled night, with your bodily resources at a low ebb.\r\nSunset will see you weaker, with your power of resistance almost\r\ngone.  Midnight will find you weaker still, and but little\r\nremoved from the point of death.  A few hours later a kind hand\r\nwill close the lids of your half-shut eyes, which never again\r\nwill behold the light.  The coffin will inclose your body, and\r\nthe last earthly journey begin.  Now," the spirit continued, "you\r\nshall all use my sight instead of your own."\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cave seemed to expand, till they resembled those\r\nof a great cathedral, while the stalactites appeared to be\r\nmetamorphosed into Gothic columns.  They found themselves among a\r\nlarge congregation that had come to attend the last sad rites,\r\nwhile the great organ played Chopin\'s "Funeral March."  The high\r\nvault and arches received the organ\'s tone, and a sombre light\r\npervaded the interior.  There was a slight flutter and a craning\r\nof necks among those in the pews, as the procession began to\r\nascend the aisle.  While the slow step of the pallbearers and\r\nthose carrying the coffin sounded on the stone floor, the clear\r\nvoice of the clergyman that headed the procession sounded these\r\nwords through the cathedral:  "I know that my Redeemer liveth,\r\nand that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth."  As\r\nthe bier advanced, Bearwarden and Ayrault recognized themselves\r\namong the pallbearers--the former with grey mustache and hair,\r\nthe latter considerably aged.  The hermetically sealed lead\r\ncoffin was inclosed in a wooden case, and the whole was draped\r\nand covered with flowers.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my faith!" cried Cortlandt, "I see my face within, yet it is\r\nbut a decomposing mass that I once described as I."\r\n\r\nThen again did the minister\'s voice proclaim, "I am the\r\nresurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in\r\nme, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth\r\nand believeth in me shall never die."\r\n\r\nThe bearers gently set down their burden; the minister read the\r\never-impressive chapter of St. Paul to the Corinthians; a bishop\r\nsolemnly and silently sprinkled earth on the coffin; and the\r\nchoir sang the 398th hymn, beginning with the words, "Hark, hark\r\nmy soul! angelic songs are swelling," which had always been\r\nCortlandt\'s favourite and the service was at an end.  The bearers\r\nagain shouldered all that was left of Henry Cortlandt, and his\r\nrelatives accompanied this to the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThen came a sweeping change of scene.  A host of monuments and\r\ngravestones reflected the sunlight, while a broad river ebbed and\r\nflowed between high banks.  A sexton and a watchman stood by a\r\ngranite vault, the heavy door of which they had opened with a\r\nlarge key.  Hard by were some gardeners and labourers, and also a\r\ncrowd of curiosity-seekers who had come to witness the last sad\r\nrites.  Presently a funeral procession appeared.  The hearse\r\nstopped near the open vault, over the door of which stood out the\r\nname of CORTLANDT, and the accompanying minister said a short\r\nprayer, while all present uncovered their heads.  After this the\r\ncoffin was borne within and set at rest upon a slab, among many\r\ngenerations of Cortlandts.  In the hearts of the relatives and\r\nfriends was genuine sorrow, but the curiosity-seekers went their\r\nway and gave little thought.  "To-morrow will be like to-day,"\r\nthey said, "and more great men will die."\r\n\r\nThen came another change of scene, though it was comparatively\r\nslight.  The sun slowly sank beyond the farther bank of the broad\r\nriver, and the moon and stars shone softly on the gravestones and\r\ncrosses.  Two gardeners smoked their short clay pipes on a bench\r\nbefore the Cortlandt vault, and talked in a slow manner.\r\n\r\n"He was a great man," said one, "and if his soul blooms like the\r\nflowers on his grave, he must be in paradise, which we know is a\r\nfiner park than this."\r\n\r\n"He was expert for the Government when the earth\'s axis was set\r\nright," said the second gardener, "and he must have been a\r\nscholar, for his calculations have all come true.  He was one of\r\nthe first three men to visit the other planets, while the\r\nobituaries in the papers say his history will be read hereafter\r\nlike the books of Caesar.  After burying all these great people,\r\nI sometimes wish I could do the same for myself, for the people I\r\nbury seem to be remembered."  After this they relapsed into their\r\nmeditations, the silence being broken only by an occasional\r\nmurmur from the river\'s steady flow.\r\n\r\nHereupon the voyagers found they were once more in the cave.  The\r\nfire had burned low, and the dawn was already in the east.\r\nCortlandt wiped his forehead, shivered, and looked extremely\r\npale.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven," he cried, "we cannot ordinarily foresee our end;\r\nfor but few would attain their predestined ending could they see\r\nit in advance.  May the veil not again be raised, lest I faint\r\nbefore it!  I looked in vain for my soul," he continued, "but\r\ncould see it nowhere."\r\n\r\n"The souls of those dying young," replied the spirit, "sometimes\r\nwish to hover near their ashes as if regretting an unfinished\r\nlife, or the opportunities that have departed; but those dying\r\nafter middle age are usually glad to be free from their bodies,\r\nand seldom think of them again."\r\n\r\n"I shall append the lines now in my head to my history," said\r\nCortlandt, "that where it goes they may go also.  They can\r\nscarcely fail to be instructive as the conclusions of a man who\r\nhas seen beyond his grave."  Whereupon be wrote a stanza in his\r\nnote-book, and closed it without showing his companions what he\r\nhad written.\r\n\r\n"May they do all the good you hope, and much more!" replied the\r\nspirit, "for the reward in the resurrection morning will vastly\r\nexceed all your labours now.\r\n\r\n"O, my friends," the spirit continued most earnestly, addressing\r\nthe three, "are you prepared for your death-beds?  When your eyes\r\nglaze in their last sleep, and you lose that temporal world and\r\nwhat you perhaps considered all, as in a haze, your dim vision\r\nwill then be displaced by the true creation that will be eternal.\r\nYour unattained ambitions, your hopes, and your ideals will be\r\nswallowed in the grave.  Your works will secure you a place in\r\nhistory, and many will remember your names until, in time,\r\noblivion covers your memory as the grass conceals your tombs.\r\nAre you prepared for the time when your eyes become blind, and\r\nyour trusted senses fail?  Your sorrowing friends will mourn, and\r\nthe flags of your clubs will fly at half-mast, but no earthly\r\nthing can help you then.  In what condition will the resurrection\r\nmorning find you, when your sins of neglect and commission plead\r\nfor vengeance, as Abel\'s blood from the ground?  After that there\r\ncan be no change.  The classification, as I have already told\r\nyou, is now going on; it will then be finished."\r\n\r\n"We are the most utterly wretched sinners!" cried Ayrault.  "Show\r\nus how we can be saved."\r\n\r\n"As an inhabitant of spirit-land, I will give you worldly\r\ncounsel," replied the bishop.  "During my earthly administration,\r\nas I told you, people came from far to hear me preach.  This was\r\nbecause I had eloquence and earnestness, both gifts of God.  But\r\nI was a miserably weak sinner myself.  That which I would, I did\r\nnot, and that which I would not that I did; and I often prayed my\r\ncongregation to follow my sermons rather than my ways.  I seemed\r\nto do my followers good, and Daniel thus commends my way in his\r\nlast chapter:  \'They that turn many to righteousness shall shine\r\nas the stars  forever and ever,\' and the explanation is clear.\r\nThere is no surer way of learning than trying to teach.  In\r\nteaching my several flocks I was also improved myself.  I was\r\nsown in weakness, but was raised in power, strength being made\r\nperfect in weakness.  Therefore improve your fellows, though\r\nyourself you cannot raise.  The knowledge that you have sent many\r\nsouls to heaven, though you are yourself a castaway, will give\r\nyou unspeakable joy, and place you in heaven wherever you may be.\r\nYet remember this: none of us can win heaven; salvation is the\r\ngift of God.  I have said as much now as you can remember.\r\nFarewell.  Improve time while you can.  Fear God and keep His\r\ncommandments.  This is the whole duty of man."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the spirit vanished in a cloud that for a\r\ntime emitted light.\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised," said Bearwarden, "that people took long\r\njourneys to hear him.  I would do so myself."\r\n\r\n"I have never had much fear of death," said Cortlandt, "but the\r\nmere thought of it now makes my knees shake, and fills my heart\r\nwith dread.  I thought I saw the most hateful forms about my\r\ncoffin, and imagined that they might be the personification of\r\ndoubt, coldness, and my other shortcomings, which had come\r\nperhaps from sympathy, in invisible form.  I was almost afraid to\r\nask the spirit for the explanation."\r\n\r\n"I saw them also," replied Bearwarden, "but took them to be\r\nswarms of microbes waiting to destroy your body, or perhaps\r\ntrying in vain to penetrate your hermetically sealed coffin."\r\n\r\nCortlandt seemed much upset, and spent the rest of the day in\r\nwriting out the facts and trying to assign a cause.  Towards\r\nevening Bearwarden, who had recovered his spirits, prepared\r\nsupper, after which they sat in the entrance to the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                            AYRAULT.\r\n\r\nAs the, night became darker they caught sight of the earth again,\r\nshining very faintly, and in his mind\'s eye Ayrault saw his\r\nsweetheart, and the old, old repining that, since reason and love\r\nbegan, has been in men\'s minds, came upon him and almost crushed\r\nhim.  Without saying anything to his companions, Ayrault left the\r\ncave, and, passing through the grove in which the spirit had paid\r\nthem his second visit, went slowly to the top of the hill about\r\nhalf a mile off, that he might the more easily gaze at the faint\r\nstar on which he could picture Sylvia.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said to himself, on reaching the summit, "I will stay\r\nhere till the earth rises higher, and when it is far above me I\r\nwill gaze at it as at heaven."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he lay down with his head on a mound of sod, and\r\nwatched the familiar planet.\r\n\r\n"We were born too soon," he soliloquized; "for had Sylvia and I\r\nbut lived in the spiritual age foretold by the bishop, we might\r\nhave held communion, while now our spirits, no matter how much in\r\nlove, are separated absolutely by a mere matter of distance.  It\r\nis a mockery to see Sylvia\'s dwelling-place, and feel that she is\r\nbeyond my vision.  O that, in the absence of something better, my\r\npoor imperfect eyes could be transformed into those of an eagle,\r\nbut with a million times the power! for though I know that with\r\nthese senses I shall see the resurrection, and hear the last\r\ntrump, that is but prospective, while now is the time I long for\r\nsight."\r\n\r\nOn the plain he had left he saw his friends\' camp-fire, while on\r\nthe other side of his elevation was a valley in which the insects\r\nchirped sharply, and through which ran a stream.  Feeling a\r\ndesire for solitude and to be as far removed as possible, he\r\narose and descended towards the water.  Though the autumn, where\r\nthey found themselves, was well advanced, this night was warm,\r\nand the rings formed a great arch above his head.  Near the\r\nstream the frogs croaked happily, as if unmindful of the long\r\nvery long Saturnian winter; for though they were removed but\r\nabout ten degrees from the equator, the sun was so remote and the\r\naxis of the planet so inclined that it was unlikely these\r\nindividual frogs would see another summer, though they might live\r\nagain, in a sense, in their descendants.  The insects also would\r\nsoon be frozen and stiff, and the tall, graceful lilies that\r\nstill clung to life would be withered and dead.  The trees, as if\r\nweeping at the evanescence of the life around them, shed their\r\nleaves at the faintest breeze.  These fluttered to the ground,\r\nor, falling into the tranquil stream, were carried away by it,\r\nand passed from sight.  Ayrault stood musing and regretting the\r\nnecessity of such general death.  "But," he thought, "I would\r\nrather die than lose my love; for then I should have had the\r\ntaste of bliss without its fulfilment, and should be worse off\r\nthan dead.  Love gilds the commonplace, and deifies all it\r\ntouches.  Love survives the winter, and in my present frame of\r\nmind I should prefer earth and cold with it to heaven and spring.\r\nOh, why is my soul so clogged by my body?"\r\n\r\nA pillar of stone standing near him was suddenly shattered, and\r\nthe bishop stood where it had been.\r\n\r\n "Because," said the spirit, answering his thought, "it has not\r\nyet power to be free."\r\n\r\n"Can a man\'s soul not rise till his body is dead? asked Ayrault.\r\n\r\nThe spirit hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me," pleaded Ayrault.  "If I could see the girl to whom\r\nI am engaged, for but a moment, could be convinced that she loves\r\nme still, my mind would be at rest.  Free my soul or spirit, or\r\nwhatever it is, from this body, that I may traverse intervening\r\nspace and be with her."\r\n\r\n"You will discover the way for yourself in time," said the spirit.\r\n\r\n"I know I shall at the last day, in the resurrection, when I am\r\nno longer in the flesh.  Then I shall have no need of your aid;\r\nfor we, know that in the resurrection they neither marry nor are\r\ngiven in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.  It\r\nis while I am mortal, and love as mortals do, that I wish to see\r\nmy promised bride.  A spirit may have other joys, and perhaps\r\nhigher; but you who have lived in the world and loved, show me\r\nthat which is now my heart\'s desire.  You have shown us the tomb\r\nin which Cortlandt will lie buried; now help me to go to one who\r\nis still alive."\r\n\r\n"I pray that God will grant you this," said the spirit, "and make\r\nme His instrument, for I see the depth of your distress."  Saying\r\nwhich, he vanished, leaving no trace in his departure except that\r\nthe pillar of stone returned to its place.\r\n\r\nWith this rather vague hope, Ayrault set off to rejoin his\r\ncompanions, for he felt the need of human sympathy.  Saturn\'s\r\nrapid rotation had brought the earth almost to the zenith, the\r\nlittle point shining with the unmistakably steady ray of a\r\nplanet.  Huge bats fluttered about him, and the great\r\ncloud-masses swept across the sky, being part of Saturn\'s\r\nceaseless whirl.  He found he was in a hypnotic or spiritualistic\r\nstate, for it was not necessary for him to have his eyes open to\r\nknow where he was.  In passing one of the pools they had noticed,\r\nhe observed that the upper and previously invisible liquid had\r\nthe bright colour of gold, and about it rested a group of figures\r\nenveloped in light.\r\n\r\n"Why do you look so sad?" they asked.  "You are in that abode of\r\ndeparted spirits known as paradise, and should be happy."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I should be happy, were I here as you are, as the\r\nreward of merit," he replied.  "But I am still in the flesh, and\r\nas such am subject to its cares."\r\n\r\n"You are about to have an experience," said another speaker.\r\n"This day your doubts will be at rest, for before another sunset\r\nyou will know more of the woman you love."\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the spiritualistic influence here somewhat\r\nweakened, for he partially lost sight of the luminous figures,\r\nand could no longer hear what they said.  His heart was in his\r\nmouth as he walked, and he felt like a man about to set out on\r\nhis honeymoon, or like a bride who knows not whether to laugh or\r\nto cry.  An indescribable exhilaration was constantly present.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," thought he, "if a caterpillar has these sensations\r\nbefore becoming a butterfly?  Though I return to the rock from\r\nwhich I sprang, I believe I shall be with Sylvia to-day."\r\n\r\nFootprints formed in the soft ground all around him, and the air\r\nwas filled with spots of phosphorescent light that coincided with\r\nthe relative positions of the brains, hearts, and eyes of human\r\nbeings.  These surrounded and often preceded him, as though\r\nleading him on, while the most heavenly anthems filled the air\r\nand the vault of the sky.\r\n\r\n"I believe," he thought, with bounding heart, "that I shall be\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of space this night."\r\n\r\nAt times he could hear even the words of the choruses ringing in\r\nhis ears, though at others he thought the effect was altogether\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, for a proof," he prayed, "that no sane man can doubt!  My\r\nfaith is implicit in the bishop and the vision, and I feel that\r\nin some way I shall return to earth ere the close of another day,\r\nfor I know I am awake, and that this is no dream."\r\n\r\nA fire burned in the mouth of the cave, within which Bearwarden\r\nand Cortlandt lay sleeping.  The specks of mica in the rocks\r\nreflected its light, but in addition to this a diffused\r\nphosphorescence filled the place, and the large sod-covered\r\nstones they used for pillows emitted purple and dark red flames.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Dick?" asked Bearwarden, awaking and groping about.\r\n"We built up the fire so that you should find the camp, but it\r\nseems to have gone down."  Saying which, he struck a match,\r\nwhereupon Ayrault ceased to see the phosphorescence or bluish\r\nlight.  At that moment a peal of thunder awakened Cortlandt, who\r\nsat up and rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Ayrault, "I will go to the Callisto and get our\r\nmackintoshes before the rain sets in."  Whereupon he left his\r\ncompanions, who were soon again fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe sky had suddenly become filled with clouds, and Ayrault\r\nhastened towards the Callisto, intending to remain there, if\r\nnecessary, until the storm was over.  For about twenty minutes he\r\nhurried on through the growing darkness, stopping once on high\r\nground to make sure of his bearings, and he had covered more than\r\nhalf the distance when the rain came on in a flood, accompanied\r\nby brilliant lightning.  Seeing the huge, hollow trunk of a\r\nfallen tree near, and not wishing to be wet through, Ayrault\r\nfired several solid shots from his revolver into the cavity, to\r\ndrive out any wild animals there might be inside, and then\r\nhurriedly crawled in, feet first.  He next drew in his head, and\r\nwas congratulating himself on his snug retreat, when the sky\r\nbecame lurid with a flash of lightning, then his head dropped\r\nforward, and he was unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                    DREAMLAND TO SHADOWLAND.\r\n\r\nAs Ayrault\'s consciousness returned, he fancied he heard music.\r\nThough distant, it was distinct, and seemed to ring from the\r\nether of space.  Occasionally it sounded even more remote, but it\r\nwas rhythmical and continuous, inspiring and stirring him as\r\nnothing that he had ever heard before.  Finally, it was overcome\r\nby the more vivid impressions upon his other senses, and he found\r\nhimself walking in the streets of his native city.  It was\r\nspring, and the trees were white with buds.  The long shadows of\r\nthe late afternoon stretched across the way, but the clear sky\r\ngave indication of prolonged twilight, and the air was warm and\r\nbalmy.  Nature was filled with life, and seemed to be proclaiming\r\nthat the cold was past.\r\n\r\nAs he moved along the street he met a funeral procession.\r\n\r\n"What a pity," he thought, "a man should die, with summer so near\r\nat hand!"\r\n\r\nHe was also surprised at the keenness of his sight; for, inclosed\r\nin each man\'s body, he saw the outline of his soul.  But the dead\r\nman\'s body was empty, like a cage without a bird.  He also read\r\nthe thoughts in their minds.\r\n\r\n"Now," said a large man in the carriage next the hearse, "I may\r\nwin her, since she is a widow."\r\n\r\nThe widow herself kept thinking:  "Would it had been I!  His life\r\nwas essential to the children, while I should scarcely have been\r\nmissed.  I wish I had no duties here, and might follow him now."\r\n\r\nWhile pondering on these things, he reached Sylvia\'s house, and\r\nwent into the little room in which he had so often seen her.  The\r\nwarm southwesterly breeze blew through the open windows, and far\r\nbeyond Central Park the approaching sunset promised to be\r\nbeautiful.  The table was covered with flowers, and though he had\r\noften seen that variety, he had never before noticed the\r\nmarvellous combinations of colours, while the room was filled\r\nwith a thousand delicious perfumes.  The thrush hanging in the\r\nwindow sang divinely, and in a silver frame he saw a likeness of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"I have always loved this room," he thought, "but it seems to me\r\nnow like heaven."\r\n\r\nHe sat down in an arm-chair from force of habit, to await his\r\nfiancee.\r\n\r\n"Oh, for a walk with Sylvia by twilight!" his thoughts ran on,\r\n"for she need not be at home again till after seven."\r\n\r\nPresently he heard the soft rustle of her dress, and rose to meet\r\nher.  Though she looked in his direction, she did not seem to see\r\nhim, and walked past him to the window.  She was the picture of\r\nloveliness silhouetted against the sky.  He went towards her, and\r\ngazed into her deep-sea eyes, which had a far-away expression.\r\nShe turned, went gracefully to the mantelpiece, and took a\r\nphotograph of herself from behind the clock.  On its back Ayrault\r\nhad scrawled a boyish verse composed by himself, which ran:\r\n\r\n           "My divine, most ideal Sylvia,\r\n               O vision, with eyes so blue,\r\n           \'Tis in the highest degree consequential,\r\n           To my existence in fact essential,\r\n               That I should be loved by you."\r\n\r\nAs she read and reread those lines, with his whole soul he\r\nyearned to have her look at him.  He watched the colour come and\r\ngo in her clear, bright complexion, and was rejoiced to see in\r\nher the personification of activity and health.  Beneath his own\r\neffusion on the photograph he saw something written in pencil, in\r\nthe hand he knew so well:\r\n\r\n       "Did you but know how I love you,\r\n           No more silly things would you ask.\r\n       With my whole heart and soul I adore you--\r\n           Idiot! goose! bombast!"\r\n\r\nAnd as she glanced at it, these thoughts crossed her mind:  "I\r\nshall never call you such names again.  How much I shall have to\r\ntell you!  It is provoking that you stay away so long."\r\n\r\nHe came still nearer--so near, in fact, that he could hear the\r\nbeating of her heart--but she still seemed entirely unconscious\r\nof his presence.  Losing his reserve and self-control, he\r\nimpulsively grasped at her hands, then fell on his knees, and\r\nthen, dumfounded, struggled to his feet.  Her hands seemed to\r\nslip through his; he was not able to touch her, and she was still\r\nunaware of his presence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a whole flood of light and the truth burst upon him.  He\r\nhad passed painlessly and unconsciously from the dreamland of\r\nSaturn to the shadowland of eternity.  The mystery was solved.\r\nLike the dead bishop, he had become a free spirit.  His prayer\r\nwas answered, and his body, struck by lightning, lay far away on\r\nthat great ringed planet.  How he longed to take in his arms the\r\ngirl who had promised herself to him, and who, he now saw, loved\r\nhim with her whole heart; but he was only an immaterial spirit,\r\nlighter even than the ether of space, and the unchangeable laws\r\nof the universe seemed to him but the irony of fate.  As a\r\nspirit, he was intangible and invisible to those in the flesh,\r\nand likewise they were beyond his control.  The tragedy of life\r\nthen dawned upon him, and the awful results of death made\r\nthemselves felt.  He glanced at Sylvia.  On coming in she had\r\nlooked radiantly happy; now she seemed depressed, and even the\r\nbird stopped singing.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he thought, "could I but return to life for one hour, to\r\ntell her how incessantly she has been in my thoughts, and how I\r\nlove her!  Death, to the aged, is no loss--in fact, a\r\nblessing--but now!" and he sobbed mentally in the anguish of his\r\nsoul.  If he could but communicate with her, he thought; but he\r\nremembered what the departed bishop had said, that it would take\r\nmost men centuries to do this, and that others could never learn.\r\nBy that time she, too, would be dead, perhaps having been the\r\nwife of some one else, and he felt a sense of jealousy even\r\nbeyond the grave.  Throwing himself upon a rug on the floor, in a\r\nparoxysm of distress, he gazed at Sylvia.\r\n\r\n"Oh, horrible mockery!" he thought, thinking of the spirit.  "He\r\ngave me worse than a stone when I asked for bread; for, in place\r\nof freedom, he sent me death.  Could I but be alive again for a\r\nfew moments!"  But, with a bitter smile, he again remembered the\r\nwords of the bishop, "What would a soul in hell not give for but\r\none hour on earth?"\r\n\r\nSylvia had seated herself on a small sofa, on which, and next to\r\nher, he had so often sat.  Her gentle eyes had a thoughtful look,\r\nwhile her face was the personification of intelligence and\r\nbeauty.  She occasionally glanced at his photograph, which she\r\nheld in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Sylvia, Sylvia!" he suddenly cried, rising to his knees at her\r\nfeet.  "I love, I adore you!  It was my longing to be with you\r\nthat brought me here.  I know you can neither see nor hear me,\r\nbut cannot your soul commune with mine?"\r\n\r\n"Is Dick here?" cried Sylvia, becoming deadly pale and getting\r\nup, "or am I losing my reason?"\r\n\r\nSeeing that she was distressed by the power of his mind, Ayrault\r\nonce more sank to the floor, burying his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nUnable to endure this longer, and feeling as if his heart must\r\nbreak, he rushed out into the street, wishing he might soothe his\r\nanguish with a hypodermic injection of morphine, and that he had\r\na body with which to divert and suppress his soul.\r\n\r\nNight had fallen, and the electric lamps cast their white rays on\r\nthe ground, while the stars overhead shone in their eternal\r\nserenity and calm.  Then was it once more brought home to him\r\nthat he was a spirit, for darkness and light were alike, and he\r\nfelt the beginning of that sense of prescience of which the\r\nbishop had spoken.  Passing through the houses of some of the\r\nclubs to which he belonged, he saw his name still upon the list\r\nof members, and then he went to the places of amusement he knew\r\nso well.  On all sides were familiar faces, but what interested\r\nhim most was the great division incessantly going on.  Here were\r\njolly people enjoying life and playing cards, who, his foresight\r\nshowed him, would in less than a year be under ground-- like\r\nMercutio, in "Romeo and Juliet," to-day known as merry fellows,\r\nwho to-morrow would be grave men.\r\n\r\nWhile his eyes beheld the sun, he had imagined the air felt warm\r\nand balmy.  He now saw that this had been a hallucination, for he\r\nwas chilled through and through.  He also perceived that be cast\r\nno shadow, and that no one observed his presence.  He, on the\r\nother hand, saw not only the air as it entered and left his\r\nfriends\' lungs, but also the substance of their brains, and the\r\nseeds of disease and death, whose presence they themselves did\r\nnot even suspect, and the seventy-five per cent of water in their\r\nbodies, making them appear like sacks of liquid.  In some he saw\r\nthe germs of consumption; in others, affections of the heart.  In\r\nall, he saw the incessant struggle between the healthy\r\nblood-cells and the malignant, omnipresent bacilli that the cells\r\nwere trying to overcome.  Many men and women he saw were in love,\r\nand he could tell what all were about to do.  Oh, the secrets\r\nthat were revealed, while the motives for acts were now laid bare\r\nthat till then he had misunderstood!  He had often heard the old\r\nsaying, that if every person in a ball-room could read the\r\nthoughts of the rest, the ball would seem a travesty on\r\nenjoyment, rather than real pleasure, and now he perceived its\r\nforce.  He also noticed that many were better than he had\r\nsupposed, and were trying, in a blundering but persevering way,\r\nto obey their consciences.  He saw some unselfish thoughts and\r\nacts.  Many things that he had attributed to irresolution or\r\ninconsistency, he perceived were in reality self- sacrifice.  He\r\nwent on in frantic disquiet, distance no longer being of\r\nconsequence, and in his roaming chanced to pass through the\r\ngraveyard in which many generations of his ancestors lay buried.\r\nWithin the leaden coffins he saw the cold remains; some well\r\npreserved, others but handfuls of dust.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, O my progenitors," he cried, "you whose blood till this\r\nmorning flowed in my veins, is there not some way by which I, as\r\na spirit, can commune with the material world?  I have always\r\nadmired your judgment and wisdom, and you have all been in\r\nShadowland longer than I.  Give me, I pray you, some ancestral\r\nadvice."\r\n\r\nThe only sound in answer was the hum of the insects that filled\r\nthe evening air.  The moonlight shone softly, but in a ghastly\r\nway, on the marble crosses of his vault and those around, and he\r\nfelt an unspeakable sadness within this abode of the dead.  "How\r\nmany unfinished lives," he thought, "have ended beneath these\r\nsods!  Unimproved talents here are buried in the ground.\r\nUnattained ambitions, and those who died before their time; those\r\nwho tried, in a half-hearted way, to improve their opportunities,\r\nand accomplished something, and those who neglected them, and did\r\nstill less--all are together here, the just with the unjust,\r\nthough it be for the last time.  The grave absorbs their bodies\r\nand ends their probationary record, from which there is no\r\nappeal."\r\n\r\nNear by were some open graves, ready to receive their occupants,\r\nwhile a little farther on he recognized the Cortlandt mausoleum,\r\nlooking exactly as when shown him, through his second sight, by\r\nthe spirit on the previous day.\r\n\r\nFrom the graves filled recently, and from many others, rose\r\nthreads of coloured matter, in the form of gases, the forerunners\r\nof miasma.  He now perceived shadowy figures flitting about on\r\nthe ground and in the air, from whose eyes poured streams of\r\nimmaterial tears.  Their brains, hearts, and vertebral columns\r\nwere the parts most easily seen, and they were filled with an\r\ninextinguishable anguish and sorrow that from its very intensity\r\nmade itself seen as a blue flame.  The ruffles and knickerbockers\r\nin which some of these were attired, evidently by the effects of\r\nthe thoughts in their minds, doubtless from force of habit from\r\nwhat they had worn on earth while alive, showed that they had\r\nbeen dead at least two hundred years.  Ayrault also now found\r\nhimself in street clothes, although when in his clubs he had worn\r\na dress suit.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, fellow-spirits," he said, addressing them, "how can I\r\ncommunicate with one that is still alive?"\r\n\r\nThey looked at him with moist eyes, but answered not a word.\r\n\r\n"I attributed the misery in my heart," thought Ayrault, "entirely\r\nto the distress at losing Sylvia, which God knows is enough; but\r\nthough I suspected it before, I now see, by my companions, that I\r\nam in the depths of hell."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                             SHEOL.\r\n\r\nFailing to find words to convey his thoughts, he threw himself\r\ninto an open grave, praying that the earth might hide his soul,\r\nas he had supposed it some day would hide his body.  But the\r\nground was like crystal, and he saw the white bones in the graves\r\nall around him.  Unable to endure these surroundings longer, he\r\nrushed back to his old haunts, where he knew he should find the\r\nfriends of his youth.  He did not pause to go by the usual way,\r\nbut passed, without stopping, through walls and buildings.  Soon\r\nhe beheld the familiar scene, and heard his own name mentioned.\r\nBut there was no comfort here, and what he had seen of old was\r\nbut an incident to what he gazed on now.  Praying with his whole\r\nheart that he might make himself heard, he stepped upon a\r\nfoot-stool, and cried:\r\n\r\n"Your bodies are decaying before me.  You are burying your\r\ntalents in the ground.  We must all stand for final sentence at\r\nthe last day, mortals and spirits alike-- there is not a shadow\r\nof a shade of doubt.  Your every thought will be known, and for\r\nevery evil deed and every idle word God will bring us into\r\njudgment.  The angel of death is among you and at work in your\r\nvery midst.  Are you prepared to receive him?  He has already\r\nkilled my body, and now that I can never die I wish there was a\r\ngrave for my soul.  I was reassured by a vision that told me I\r\nwas safe, but either it was a hallucination, or I have been\r\nbetrayed by some spirit.  Last night I still lived, and my body\r\nobeyed my will.  Since then I have experienced death, and with\r\nthe resulting increased knowledge comes the loss of all hope,\r\nwith keener pangs than I supposed could exist.  Oh, that I had\r\nnow their opportunities, that I might write a thesis that should\r\nlive forever, and save millions of souls from the anguish of\r\nmine!  Inoculate your mortal bodies with the germs of faith and\r\nmutual love, in a stronger degree than they dwelt in me, lest you\r\nlose the life above."\r\n\r\nBut no one heard him, and he preached in vain.\r\n\r\nHe again rushed forth, and, after a half-involuntary effort,\r\nfound himself in the street before his loved one\'s home.\r\nScarcely knowing why, except that it had become nature to wish to\r\nbe near her, he stood for a long time opposite her dwelling.\r\n\r\n"O house!" he cried, "inanimate object that can yet enthral me\r\nso, I stand before your cold front as a suppliant from a very\r\ndistant realm; yet in my sadness I am colder than your stones,\r\nmore alone than in a desolate place.  She that dwells within you\r\nholds my love.  I long for her shadow or the sound of her step.\r\nI am more wretchedly in love than ever--I, an impotent, invisible\r\nspirit.  Must I bear this sorrow in addition to my others, in my\r\nfruitless search for rest?  My life will be a waking nightmare,\r\nmost bitter irony of fate."\r\n\r\nThe trees swayed above his head, and the moon, in its last\r\nquarter, looked dreamily at him.\r\n\r\n"Ah," thought Ayrault, "could I but sleep and be happy!\r\nDrowsiness and weariness, fatigue\'s grasp is on me; or may\r\nSylvia\'s nearness soothe, as her voice has brought me calm!\r\nQuiet I may some day enjoy, but slumber again, never!  I see that\r\nsouls in hades must ever have their misdeeds before them.  Happy\r\nman in this world, the repentant\'s sins are forgiven!  You lose\r\nyour care in sleep.  Somnolence and drowsiness--balm of aching\r\nhearts, angels of mercy!  Mortals, how blessed! until you die,\r\nGod sends you this rest.  When I recall summer evenings with\r\nSylvia, while gentle zephyrs fanned our brows, I would change\r\nPope\'s famous line to \'Man never is, but always HAS BEEN\r\nblessed.\'"\r\n\r\nA clock in a church-steeple now struck three, the sound ringing\r\nthrough the still night air.\r\n\r\n"It will soon be time for ghosts to go," thought Ayrault.  "I\r\nmust not haunt her dwelling."\r\n\r\nThere was a light in Sylvia\'s study, and Ayrault remained\r\nmeditatively gazing at it.\r\n\r\n"Happy lamp," he thought, "to shed your light on one so fair!\r\nShe can see you, and you shine, for her.  You are better off than\r\nI.  Would that her soul might shine for me, as your light shines\r\nfor her!  The light of my life has departed.  O that the darkness\r\nwere complete!  I am dead," his thoughts ran on, and when the\r\nprivilege-- bitter word!--that permits me to remain here has\r\nexpired, I must doubtless return to Saturn, and there in\r\npurgatory work out my probation.  But what comfort is it that a\r\nfew centuries hence I may be able to revisit my native earth?--\r\n\r\n       The flowers will bloom in the morning light,\r\n           And the lark salute the sun,\r\n       The earth will continue to roll through space,\r\n       And I may be nearer my final grace,\r\n           But Sylvia\'s life-thread will be spun.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Even Sylvia\'s house will be a heap of ruins, or its place will\r\nbe taken by something else.  If I had Sylvia, I should care for\r\nnothing; as I have lost her, even this sight, though sweet, must\r\nalways bring regret.  I wish, at all events, I might see Sylvia,\r\nif only with these spirit-eyes, since, as a mortal, she may never\r\ngladden my sight again."\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, he now perceived that he could see,\r\nnotwithstanding the drawn shades.  Sylvia was at her\r\nwriting-desk, in a light-coloured wrapper.  She sat there resting\r\nher head on her hand, looking thoughtful but worried.  Though it\r\nwas so late, she had not retired.  The thrush that Ayrault had\r\noften in life admired, and that she had for some reason brought\r\nup-stairs, was silent and asleep.\r\n\r\n"Happy bird!" he said, "you obtain rest and forgetfulness on\r\ncovering your head; but what wing can cover my soul?  I used to\r\nwish I might flutter towards heaven on natural wings like you,\r\nlittle thrush.  Now I can, indeed, outfly you.  But whatever I do\r\nI\'m unhappy, and wherever I go I\'m in hell.  What is man in his\r\nhelpless, first spiritual state?  He is but a flower, and withers\r\nsoon.  Had I, like the bishop, been less blind, and obeyed my\r\nconscience clear, I might have returned to my native earth while\r\nSylvia still sojourns here; and coming thus by virtue of\r\ndevelopment, I should be able to commune with her.\r\n\r\n"What is life?" he continued.  "In the retrospect, nothing.  It\r\nseems to me already as but an infinitesimal point.  Things that\r\nengrossed me, and seemed of such moment, that overshadowed the\r\nduty of obeying my conscience--what were they, and where?  Ah,\r\nwhere?  They endured but a moment.  Reality and evanescence--\r\nevanescence and reality."\r\n\r\nThe light in Sylvia\'s room was out now, and in the east he beheld\r\nthe dawn.  The ubiquitous grey which he saw at night was invaded\r\nby streams of glorious crimson and blue that reached far up into\r\nthe sky.  He gazed at the spectacle, and then once more at that\r\nhouse in which his love was centred.\r\n\r\n"Would I might be her guardian angel, to guide her in the right\r\nand keep her from all harm!  Sleep on, Sylvia.  Sweet one, sleep.\r\nYon stars fade beside your eyes.  Your thoughts and your soul are\r\nfairer far than the east in this day\'s sunrise.  I know what I\r\nhave lost.  Ah, desolating knowledge! for I have read Sylvia\'s\r\nheart, and know I was loved as truly as I loved.  When Bearwarden\r\nand Cortlandt break her the news--ah, God! will she live, and do\r\nthey yet know I am dead?"\r\n\r\nAgain came that spasm to shed spirit tears, and had he not known\r\nit impossible he would have thought his heart must break.\r\n\r\nThe birds twittered, and the light grew, but Ayrault lay with his\r\nface upon the ground.  Finally the spirit of unrest drove him on.\r\nHe passed the barred door of his own house, through which he had\r\nentered so often.  It was unchanged, but seemed deserted.  Next,\r\nhe went to the water-front, where he had left his yacht.\r\nInvisibly and sadly he stood upon her upper deck, and gazed at\r\nthe levers, in response to his touch on which the craft had cleft\r\nthe waves, reversed, or turned like a thing of life.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas a pretty toy," he mused, "and many hours of joy have I had\r\nas I floated through life on board of her."\r\n\r\nAs he moped along he beheld two unkempt Italians having a\r\npiano-organ and a violin.  The music was not fine, but it touched\r\na chord in Ayrault\'s breast, for he had waltzed with Sylvia to\r\nthat air, and it made his heart ache.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the acuteness of my distress," he cried, "the utter depth of\r\nmy sorrow!  Can I have no peace in death, no oblivion in the\r\ngrave?  I am reminded of my blighted, hopeless love in all kinds\r\nof unexpected ways, by unforeseen trifles.  Oh, would I might,\r\nindeed, die!  May obliteration be my deliverer!"\r\n\r\n"Poor fellows," he continued, glancing at the Italians, for he\r\nperceived that neither of the players was happy; the pianist was\r\navaricious, while the violinist\'s natural and habitual jealousy\r\ndestroyed his peace of mind.\r\n\r\n"Unhappiness seems the common lot," thought Ayrault.  "Earth\r\ncannot give that joy for which we sigh.  Poor fellows! though you\r\nrack my ears and distress my heart, I cannot help you now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                      THE PRIEST\'S SERMON.\r\n\r\nIt being the first day of the week, the morning air was filled\r\nwith chimes from many steeples.\r\n\r\n"Divine service always comforted in life," thought Ayrault,\r\n"perchance it may do so now, when I have reached the state for\r\nwhich it tried to prepare me."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he moved on with the throng, and soon was ascending\r\nthe heights of Morningside Park, after which, he entered the\r\ncathedral.  The priest whose voice had so often thrilled him\r\nstood at his post in his surplice, and the choir had finished the\r\nprocessional hymn.  During the responses in the litany, and\r\nbetween the commandments, while the congregation and the choir\r\nsang, he heard their natural voices as of old ascending to the\r\nvaulted roof and arrested there.  He now also heard their\r\nspiritual voices resulting from the earnestness of their prayers.\r\nThese were rung through the vaster vault of space, arousing a\r\nspiritual echo beyond the constellations and the nebulae.  The\r\nservice, which was that of the Protestant Episcopal Church,\r\ntouched him as deeply as usual, after which the rector ascended\r\nthe steps to the pulpit.\r\n\r\n"The text, this morning," he began, "is from the eighth chapter\r\nof St. Paul\'s Epistle to the Romans, at the eighteenth verse:\r\n\'For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not\r\nworthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in us.\'\r\nLet us suppose that you or I, brethren, should become a free and\r\ndisembodied spirit.  A minute vein in the brain bursts, or a clot\r\nforms in the heart.  It may be a mere trifle, some unexpected\r\nthing, yet the career in the flesh is ended, the eternal life of\r\nthe liberated spirit begun.  The soul slips from earth\'s grasp,\r\nas air from our fingers, and finds itself in the frigid,\r\nboundless void of space.  Yet, through some longing this soul\r\nmight rejoin us, and, though invisible, might hear the\r\nchurch-bells ring, and long to recall some one of the many bright\r\nSunday mornings spent here on earth.  Has a direful misfortune\r\nbefallen this brother, or has a slave been set free?  Let us\r\nsuppose for a moment that the first has occurred.  \'Vanity of\r\nvanities,\' said the old preacher.  \'Calamity of calamities,\' says\r\nthe new.  That soul\'s probationary period is ended; his record,\r\non which he must go, is forever made.  He has been in the flesh,\r\nlet us say, one, two, three or four score years; before him are\r\nthe countless aeons of eternity.  He may have had a reasonably\r\nsatisfactory life, from his point of view, and been fairly\r\nsuccessful in stilling conscience.  That still, small voice\r\ndoubtless spoke pretty sharply at first, but after a while it\r\nrarely troubled him, and in the end it spoke not at all.  He may,\r\nin a way, have enjoyed life and the beauties of nature.  He has\r\nseen the fresh leaves come and go, but he forgot the moral, that\r\nbe himself was but a leaf, and that, as they all dropped to earth\r\nto make more soil, his ashes must also return to the ground.  But\r\nhis soul, friends and brethren, what becomes of that?  Ah! it is\r\nthe study of this question that moistens our eyes with tears.  No\r\nevil man is really happy here, and what must be his suffering in\r\nthe cold, cold land of spirits?  No slumber or forgetfulness can\r\nease his lot in hades, and after his condemnation at the last\r\njudgment he must forever face the unsoftened realities of\r\neternity.  No evil thing or thought can find lodgment in heaven.\r\nIf it could, heaven would not be a happy place; neither can any\r\nman improve in the abyss of hell.  As the horizon gradually\r\ndarkens, and this soul recedes from God, the time spent in the\r\nflesh must come to seem the most infinitesimal moment, more\r\nevanescent than the tick of a clock.  It seems dreadful that for\r\nsuch short misdoings a soul should suffer so long, but no man can\r\nbe saved in spite of himself.  He had the opportunities--and the\r\nknowledge of this must give a soul the most acute pang.\r\n\r\n"In Revelation, xx, 6, we find these words, \'Blessed and holy is\r\nhe that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second\r\ndeath hath no power.\'  I have often asked myself, May not this\r\nmean that those with a bad record in the general resurrection\r\nafter a time cease to exist, since all suffer one death at the\r\nclose of their period here?\r\n\r\n"This is somewhat suggested by Proverbs, xii, 28,.  \'In the way\r\nof righteousness is life, and in the pathway thereof there is no\r\ndeath.\'  This might limit the everlasting damnation, so often\r\nrepeated elsewhere, to the lives of the condemned, since to them,\r\nin a sense, it would be everlasting.\r\n\r\n"Let us now turn to the bright picture--the soul that has\r\nweathered the storms of life and has reached the haven of rest.\r\nThe struggles, temptations, and trials overcome, have done their\r\nwork of refining with a rapidity that could not have been\r\nequalled in any other way, and though, perhaps, very imperfect\r\nstill, the journey is ever on.  The reward is tenfold, yet in\r\nproportion to what this soul has done, for we know that the\r\nservant who best used his ten talents was made ruler over ten\r\ncities, while he that increased his five talents by five received\r\nfive; and the Saviour in whom he trusted, by whose aid he made\r\nhis fight, stands ready to receive him, saying, \'Enter thou into\r\nthe joy of thy Lord.\'\r\n\r\n"As the dark, earthly background recedes, the clouds break and\r\nthe glorious light appears, the contrast heightening the\r\never-unfolding and increasing delights, which are as great as the\r\nrecipients have power to enjoy, since these righteous souls\r\nreceive their rewards in proportion to the weight of the crosses\r\nthat they have borne in the right spirit.  These souls are a joy\r\nto their Creator, and are the heirs of Him in heaven.  The\r\nceaseless, sleepless activity that must obtain in both paradise\r\nand hades, and that must make the hearts of the godless grow\r\nfaint at the contemplation, is also a boundless promise to those\r\nwho have Him who is all in all.\r\n\r\n"Where is now thy Saviour? where is now thy God? the unjust man\r\nhas asked in his heart when he saw his just neighbour struggling\r\nand unsuccessful.  Both the righteous and the unrighteous man are\r\ndead.  The one has found his Saviour, the other is yearly losing\r\nGod.  What is the suffering of the present momentary time, eased\r\nas it is by God\'s mercy and presence, compared with the glories\r\nthat await us?  What would it be if our lives here were filled\r\nwith nothing else, as ye know that your labour is not vain in the\r\nLord?  Time and eternity--the finite and the infinite.  Death\r\nwas, indeed, a deliverer, and the sunset of the body is the\r\nsunrise of the soul."\r\n\r\nThe priest held himself erect as a soldier while delivering this\r\nsermon, making the great cathedral ring with his earnest and\r\nsolemn voice, while Ayrault, as a spirit, saw how absolutely he\r\nmeant and believed every word that he said.\r\n\r\nNearly all the members of the congregation were moved--some more,\r\nsome less than they appeared.  After the benediction they rapidly\r\ndispersed, carrying in their hearts the germs he had sown; but\r\nwhether these would bear fruit or wither, time alone could show.\r\n\r\nAyrault had noticed Sylvia\'s father and mother in church, but\r\nSylvia herself was not there, and he was distressed to think she\r\nmight be ill.\r\n\r\n"Why," pondered Ayrault, "am I so unhappy?  I was baptized,\r\nconfirmed, and have taken the sacrament.  I have always had an\r\nunshaken faith, and, though often unsuccessful, have striven to\r\nobey my conscience.  The spirits also on Saturn kept saying I\r\nshould be happy.  Now, did this mean it was incumbent upon me to\r\nrejoice, because of some blessing I already had, and did not\r\nappreciate, or did their prescience show them some prospective\r\nhappiness I was to enjoy?  The visions also of Violet, the angel,\r\nand the lily, which I believed, and still believe, were no mere\r\nempty fancies, should have given me the most unspeakable joy.  It\r\nmay be a mistake to apply earthly logic to heavenly things, but\r\nthe fundamental laws of science cannot change.\r\n\r\n"Why am I so unhappy?" he continued, returning to his original\r\nquestion.  "The visions gave promise of special grace, perhaps\r\nsome special favour.  True, my prayer to see Sylvia was heard,\r\nbut, considering the sacrifice, this has been no blessing.  The\r\nrequest cannot have been wrong in itself, and as for the manner,\r\nthere was no arrogance in my heart.  I asked as a mortal, as a\r\nman of but finite understanding, for what concerned me most.\r\nWhy, oh why, so wretched?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                         HIC ILLE JACET.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the thunder-shower passed off, but was followed by a\r\ncold, drenching rain.  Supposing Ayrault had remained in the\r\nCallisto, Bearwarden and Cortlandt did not feel anxious, and, not\r\nwishing to be wet through, remained in the cave, keeping up a\r\ngood fire with the wood they had collected.  Towards evening a\r\ncold wind came up, and, thinking this might clear the air, they\r\nventured out, but, finding the ground saturated, and that the\r\nrain was again beginning to fall, they returned to shelter,\r\nprepared a dinner of canned meat, and made themselves as\r\ncomfortable as possible for the night.\r\n\r\n"I am surprised," said Cortlandt, "that Dick did not try to\r\nreturn to us, since he had the mackintoshes."\r\n\r\n"I dare say he did try," replied Bearwarden, "but finding the\r\ncourse inundated, and knowing we should not need the mackintoshes\r\nif we remained under cover, decided to put back.  The Callisto\r\nis, of course, as safe as a church."\r\n\r\n"I hope," said Cortlandt, "no harm has come to him on the way.\r\nIt will be a weight off my mind to see him safely with us."\r\n\r\n"Should he not turn up in the morning," replied Bearwarden, "we\r\nmust begin a search for him bright and early."\r\n\r\nMaking up the fire as near the entrance of the cave as they could\r\nfind a dry place, so that Ayrault should see it if he attempted\r\nto return during the night, they piled on wood, and talked of\r\ntheir recent experiences.\r\n\r\n"However unwilling I was," said Cortlandt, "to believe my senses,\r\nwhich I felt were misleading me, I can no longer doubt the\r\nreality of that spirit bishop, or the truth of what be says.\r\nWhen you look at the question dispassionately, it is what you\r\nmight logically expect.  In my desire to disprove what is to us\r\nsupernatural, I tried to create mentally a system that would be a\r\nsubstitute for the one he described, but could evolve nothing\r\nthat so perfectly filled the requirements, or that was so simple.\r\nNothing seems more natural than that man, having been evolved\r\nfrom stone, should continue his ascent till he discards material\r\naltogether.  The metamorphism is more striking in the first\r\nchange than in the second.  Granted that the soul is immaterial,\r\nand that it leaves the body after death, what is there to keep it\r\non earth?  Gravitation cannot affect it.  What is more likely\r\nthan that it is left behind by the earth in its orbit, or that it\r\ncontinues its forward motion, but in a straight line, till,\r\nreaching the paths of the greater planets, it is drawn to them by\r\nsome affinity or attraction that the earth does not possess, and\r\nthat the souls held in that manner remain here on probation,\r\ndeveloping like young animals or children, till, by gradually\r\nacquired power, resulting from their wills, they are able to rise\r\nagain into space, to revisit the earth, and in time to explore\r\nthe universe?  It might easily come about that, by some\r\nexplainable sympathy, the infant good souls are drawn to this\r\nplanet, while the condemned pass on to Cassandra, which holds\r\nthem by some property peculiar to itself, until perhaps they,\r\ntoo, by virtue of their wills, acquire new power, unless\r\ninvolution sets in and they lose what they have.  The simplicity\r\nof the thing is what surprises me now, and that for ages\r\nphilosophers have been racking their brains with every\r\nconceivable fancy, when, by simply extending and following\r\nnatural laws, they could discern the whole."\r\n\r\n"It is the old story," said Bearwarden, "of Columbus and the egg.\r\nSchopenhouer and his predecessors appear to have tried every idea\r\nbut the right one, and even Darwin and Huxley fell short in their\r\nreasoning, because they tried to obtain more or less than four by\r\nputting two with two."\r\n\r\nThus they sat and talked while the night wore on.  Neither\r\nthought of sleeping, hoping all the while that Ayrault might walk\r\nin as he had the night before.\r\n\r\nAt last the dawn began to tint the east, and the growing light\r\nshowed them that the storm had passed.  The upper strata of\r\nSaturn\'s atmosphere being filled with infinitesimal particles of\r\ndust, as a result of its numerous volcanoes, the conditions were\r\nhighly favourable to beautiful sunrises and sunsets.  Soon\r\ncoloured streaks extended far into the sky, and though they knew\r\nthat when the sun\'s disc appeared it would seem small, it filled\r\nthe almost boundless eastern horizon with the most variegated and\r\ngorgeous hues.\r\n\r\nTurning away from the welcome sight--for their minds were ill at\r\nease--they found the light strong enough for their search to\r\nbegin.  Writing on a sheet of paper, in a large hand, "Have gone\r\nto the Callisto to look for you; shall afterwards return here,"\r\nthey pinned this in a conspicuous place and set out due west,\r\nkeeping about a hundred yards apart.  The ground was wet and\r\nslippery, but overhead all was clear, and the sun soon shone\r\nbrightly.  Looking to right and left, and occasionally shouting\r\nand discharging their revolvers, they went on for half an hour.\r\n\r\n"I have his tracks," called Bearwarden, and Cortlandt hastened to\r\njoin him.\r\n\r\nIn the soft ground, sure enough, they saw Ayrault\'s footprints,\r\nand, from the distance between them, concluded that he must have\r\nbeen running or walking very fast; but the rain had washed down\r\nthe edges of the incision.  The trail ascended a gentle slope,\r\nwhere they lost it; but on reaching the summit they saw it again\r\nwith the feet together, as though Ayrault had paused, and about\r\nit were many other impressions with the feet turned in, as if the\r\nwalkers or standers had surrounded Ayrault, who was in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n"I hope," said Cortlandt, "these are nothing more than the\r\nfootprints we have seen formed about ourselves."\r\n\r\n"See," said Bearwarden, "Dick\'s trail goes on, and the others\r\nvanish.  They cannot have been made by savages or Indians, for\r\nthey seem to have had weight only while standing."\r\n\r\nThey then resumed their march, firing a revolver shot at\r\nintervals of a minute.  Suddenly they came upon a tall, straight\r\ntree, uprooted by the wind and lying diagonally across their\r\npath.  Following with their eyes the direction in which it lay,\r\nthey saw a large, hollow trunk, with the bark stripped off, and\r\ncharred as if struck by lightning.  Obliged to pass near this by\r\nthe uprooted tree-whose thick trunk, upheld by the branches at\r\nthe head, lay raised about two feet from the ground-- both\r\nsearchers gave a start, and stood still as if petrified.  Inside\r\nthe great trunk they saw a head, and, on looking more closely,\r\ndescried Ayrault\'s body.  Grasping it by the arms, they drew it\r\nout.  The face was pale and the limbs were stiff.  Instantly\r\nCortlandt unfastened the collar, while Bearwarden applied a flask\r\nto the lips.  But they soon found that their efforts were vain.\r\n\r\n"The spirit!" ejaculated Cortlandt.  "Dick may be in a trance, in\r\nwhich case he can help us.  Let us will hard and long."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they threw themselves on their faces, closing their\r\neyes, that nothing might distract their concentration.  Minutes,\r\nwhich seemed like ages, passed, and there was no response.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Bearwarden, "will together, hard."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stillness was broken by the spirit\'s voice, which\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I felt more than one mind calling, but the effect was so slight\r\nI thought first I was mistaken.  I will help you in what you\r\nwant, for the young man is not dead, neither is he injured."\r\n\r\nSaying which, he stretched himself upon Ayrault, worked his lungs\r\nartificially, and willed with an intensity the observers could\r\nfeel where they stood.  Quickly the colour returned to Ayrault\'s\r\ncheeks, and with the spirit\'s assistance he sat up and leaned\r\nagainst the tree that had protected him from the storm.\r\n\r\n"Your promise was realized," he said, addressing the spirit.  "I\r\nhave seen what I shall never forget, and lest the anguish--the\r\nvision of which I saw--come true, let us return to the earth, and\r\nnot leave it till I have tasted in reality the joys that in the\r\nspirit I seemed to have missed.  I have often longed in this life\r\nto be in the spirit, but never knew what longing was, till I\r\nexperienced it as a spirit, to be once more in the flesh."\r\n\r\n"You see the mercy of God," said the spirit, "in not ordinarily\r\nallowing the spirits of the departed to revisit earth until they\r\nare prepared--that is, until they are sufficiently advanced to go\r\nthere unaided--by which time they have come to understand the\r\nwisdom of God\'s laws.  In your case the limiting laws were\r\npartially suspended, so that you were able to return at once,\r\nwith many of the faculties and senses of spirits, but without\r\ntheir accumulated experience.  It speaks well for your state of\r\npreparation that, without having had those disguised blessings,\r\nillness or misfortune, you were not utterly crushed by what you\r\nsaw when temporarily released.  While in the trance you were not\r\nin hell, but experienced the feelings that all mortals would if\r\nallowed to return immediately.  Thus no lover can return to earth\r\ntill his fiancee has joined him here, or till, perceiving the\r\nbenevolence of God\'s ways, he is not distressed at what he sees,\r\nand has the companionship of a host of kindred spirits.\r\n\r\n"The spirits you saw in the cemetery were indeed in hell, but had\r\nbecome sufficiently developed to revisit the earth, though doing\r\nso did not relieve their distress; for neither the development of\r\ntheir senses, which intensifies their capacity for remorse and\r\nregret, nor their investigations into God\'s boundless mercies,\r\nwhich they have deliberately thrown away, can comfort them.\r\n\r\n"Some of your ancestors are on Cassandra, and others are in\r\npurgatory here.  Though a few faintly felt your prayer, none were\r\nable to return and answer beside their graves.  It was at your\r\nrequest and prayer that He freed your spirit, but you see how\r\nunhappy it made you."\r\n\r\n"I see," replied Ayrault, "that no man should wish to anticipate\r\nthe workings of the Almighty, although I have been unspeakably\r\nblessed in that He made an exception--if I may so call it--in my\r\nfavour, since, in addition to revealing the responsibilities of\r\nlife, it has shown me the inestimable value and loyalty of\r\nwoman\'s love.  I fear, however, that my return to earth greatly\r\ndistressed the waterer of the flowers you showed me."\r\n\r\n"She already sleeps," replied the spirit, "and I have comforted\r\nher by a dream in which she sees that you are well."\r\n\r\n"When shall we start?" asked Bearwarden.\r\n\r\n"As soon as you can get ready," replied Ayrault.  "I would not\r\nrisk running short of enough current to generate the apergy\r\nneeded to get us back.  I dare say when I have been on earth a\r\nfew years, and have done something for the good of my\r\nsoul--which, as I take it, can be accomplished as well by\r\nadvancing science as in any other way--I shall pine for another\r\njourney in space as I now do to return."\r\n\r\n"How I wish I were engaged," said Bearwarden, glancing at\r\nCortlandt, and overjoyed at Ayrault\'s recovery.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they resumed their march in the direction in which\r\nthey had been going when they found Ayrault, and were soon beside\r\nthe Callisto.  Cortlandt worked the combination lock of the lower\r\nentrance, through which they crawled.  Going to the second story,\r\nthey opened a large window and let down a ladder, on which the\r\nspirit ascended at their invitation.\r\n\r\nBearwarden and Ayrault immediately set about combining the\r\nchemicals that were to produce the force necessary to repel them\r\nfrom Saturn.  Bubbles of hydrogen were given off from the lead\r\nand zinc plates, and the viscous primary batteries quickly had\r\nthe wires passing through a vacuum at a white heat.\r\n\r\n"I see you are nearly ready to start," said the spirit, "so I\r\nmust say farewell."\r\n\r\n"Will you not come with us?" asked Ayrault.\r\n\r\n"No," replied the spirit.  "I do not wish to be away as long as\r\nit will take you to reach the earth.  The Callisto\'s atmosphere\r\ncould not absorb my body, so that, should I leave you before your\r\narrival, you would be burdened with a corpse.  I may visit you in\r\nthe spirit, though the desire and effort for communion with\r\nspirits, to be of most good, must needs come from the earth.  Ere\r\nlong, my intuition tells me, we shall meet again.\r\n\r\n"The vision of your own grave," he continued, addressing\r\nCortlandt, "may not come true for many years, but however long\r\nyour lives may be, according to earthly reckoning, remember that\r\nwhen they are past they will seem to have been hardly more than a\r\nmoment, for they are the personification of frailty and\r\nevanescence."\r\n\r\nHe held up his hands and blessed them; and then repeating,\r\n"Farewell and a happy return!" descended as he had come up.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with misty shadows, and the pulsating hearts,\r\nluminous brains, and centres of spiritual activity quivered with\r\nmotion.  They surrounded the incarnate spirit of the bishop and\r\nset up the soft, musical hum the travellers had heard so often\r\nsince their arrival on Saturn.\r\n\r\n"I now understand," thought Ayrault, "why the spirits I met kept\r\nrepeating that I should be happy.  They perceived I was to be\r\ntranslated, and though they doubtless knew what suffering it\r\nwould cause, they also knew I should be awakened to a sense of\r\ngreat realities, of which I understood but little."\r\n\r\nThey drew up the ladder and turned on the current, and the\r\nCallisto slowly began to rise, while the three friends crowded\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!" called the spirit\'s pleasant voice, to which the men\r\nreplied in chorus.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set on the surface of the planet while they made\r\ntheir preparations; but as the Callisto rose higher, it seemed to\r\nrise again, making the sides of their car shine like silver, and,\r\ncarefully closing the two open windows, they watched the\r\nfast-receding world, so many times larger and more magnificent\r\nthan their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                          MOTHER EARTH.\r\n\r\n"There is something sad," said Cortlandt, "about the end of\r\neverything, but I am more sorry to leave Saturn than I have ever\r\nbeen in taking leave of any other place."\r\n\r\nWhen beyond the limits of the atmosphere they applied the full\r\ncurrent, and were soon once more cleaving the ether at cometary\r\nspeed, their motion towards the sun being aided by that great\r\nbody itself.\r\n\r\nThey quickly passed beyond the outer edge of the vast silvery\r\nrings, and then crossed one after another the orbits of the\r\nmoons, from the last of which, Iapetus, they obtained their final\r\ncourse in the direction of the earth.  They had an acute feeling\r\nof homesickness for the mysterious planet on which, while yet\r\nmortal, they had found paradise, and had communed with spirits as\r\nno modern men ever did.\r\n\r\nWithout deviating from their almost straight line, they passed\r\nwithin a million miles of Jupiter, which had gained in its\r\nsmaller orbit on Saturn, and a few days later crossed the track\r\nof Mars.\r\n\r\nAs the earth had completed nearly half a revolution in its orbit\r\nsince their departure, they here turned somewhat to the right by\r\nattracting the ruddy planet, in order to avoid passing too near\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n"On some future expedition," said Ayrault, "and when we have a\r\nsupply of blue glasses, we can take a trip to Venus, if we can\r\nfind a possible season in her year.  Compared with this journey,\r\nit would be only like going round the block."\r\n\r\nTwo days later they had rounded the sun, and laid their course in\r\npursuit of the earth.\r\n\r\nThat the astronomers in the dark hemisphere were at their posts\r\nand saw them, was evident; for a brilliant beam of light again\r\nflashed forth, this time from a point a little south of the\r\narctic circle, and after shining one minute, telegraphed this\r\nmessage:  "Rejoiced to see you again.  Hope all are well."\r\n\r\nSince they were not sufficiently near the moon\'s shadow, they\r\ndirected their light-beam into their own, which trailed off on\r\none side, and answered:  "All well, thank you.  Have wonderful\r\nthings to relate."\r\n\r\nThe men at the telescopes then, as before, read the message, and\r\ntelephoned the light this next question:  "When are you coming\r\ndown, that we may notify the newspapers?"\r\n\r\n"We wish one more sight of the earth from this height, by\r\ndaylight.  We are now swinging to get between it and the sun."\r\n\r\n"We have erected a monument in Van Cortlandt Park, and engraved\r\nupon it, \'At this place James Bearwarden, Henry Chelmsford\r\nCortlandt, and Richard Rokeby Ayrault left earth, December 21, A.\r\nD. 2000, to visit Jupiter.\'"\r\n\r\n"Add to it, \'They returned on the 10th of the following June.\'"\r\n\r\nSoon the Callisto came nearly between the earth and the sun, when\r\nthe astronomers could see it only through darkened glasses, and\r\nit appeared almost as a crescent.  The sight the travellers then\r\nbeheld was superb.  It was about 11 A. M. in London, and Europe\r\nwas spread before them like a map.  All its peninsulas and\r\nislands, enclosed blue seas, and bays came out in clear relief.\r\nGradually Russia, Germany, France, the British Isles, and Spain\r\nmoved towards the horizon, as in grand procession, and at the\r\nsame time the Western hemisphere appeared.  The hour of day at\r\nthe longitude above which they hung was about the same as when\r\nthey set out, but the sun shone far more directly upon the\r\nNorthern hemisphere than then, and instead of bleak December,\r\nthis was the leafy month of June.\r\n\r\nThey were loath to end the lovely scene, and would fain have\r\nremained where they were while the earth revolved again; but,\r\nremembering that their friends must by this time be waiting, they\r\nshut off the repulsion from the earth.\r\n\r\n"We need not apply the apergy to the earth until quite near,"\r\nsaid Ayrault, "since a great part of the top speed will be taken\r\noff by the resistance of the atmosphere, especially as we go in\r\nbase first.  We have only to keep a sufficiently strong repulsion\r\non the dome to prevent our turning over, and to see that our\r\nspeed is not great enough to heat the car."\r\n\r\nWhen about fifty miles from the surface they felt the expected\r\ncheck, and concluded they had reached the upper limits of the\r\natmosphere.  And this increased, notwithstanding the decrease in\r\ntheir speed, showing how quickly the air became dense.\r\n\r\nWhen about a mile from the earth they had the Callisto well in\r\nhand, and allowed it to descend slowly.  The ground was already\r\nblack with people, who, having learned where the Callisto was to\r\ntouch, had hastened to Van Cortlandt Park.\r\n\r\n"I am overjoyed to see you," said Sylvia, when she and Ayrault\r\nmet.  "I had the most dreadful presentiment that something had\r\ngone wrong with you.  One afternoon and evening I was so\r\nperplexed, and during the night had a series of nightmares that I\r\nshall never forget.  I really believed you were near me, but your\r\nnature seemed to have changed, for, instead of its making me\r\nhappy, I was frightfully distressed.  The next day I was very\r\nill, and unable to get up; but during the morning I fell asleep\r\nand had another dream, which was intensely realistic and made me\r\nbelieve--yes, convinced me--that you were well.  After that dream\r\nI soon recovered; but oh, the anguish of the first!"\r\n\r\nAyrault did not tell her then that he had been near her, and of\r\nhis unspeakable suffering, of which hers had been but the echo.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later a clergyman tied the knot that was to unite\r\nthem forever.\r\n\r\nWhile Sylvia and Ayrault were standing up to receive the\r\ncongratulations of their friends, Bearwarden, in shaking his\r\nhand, said:\r\n\r\n"Remember, we have been to neither Uranus, nor Neptune, nor\r\nCassandra, which may be as interesting as anything we have seen.\r\nShould you want to take another trip, count me as your humble\r\nservant."  And Cortlandt, following behind him, said the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Sylvia went up-stairs to change her dress,\r\nand when she came down she and Ayrault set out on their journey\r\ntogether through life, amid a chorus of cheers and a shower of\r\nrice.\r\n\r\nCortlandt then returned to his department at Washington, and\r\nBearwarden resumed his duties with the Terrestrial Axis\r\nStraightening Company, in the presidential chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg Etext:  A Journey in Other Worlds, J.
