Loewenstein, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAISIE KNEW\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nHENRY JAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated; but\r\nby the decision on the appeal the judgement of the divorce-court was\r\nconfirmed as to the assignment of the child. The father, who, though\r\nbespattered from head to foot, had made good his case, was, in pursuance\r\nof this triumph, appointed to keep her: it was not so much that the\r\nmother\'s character had been more absolutely damaged as that the\r\nbrilliancy of a lady\'s complexion (and this lady\'s, in court, was\r\nimmensely remarked) might be more regarded as showing the spots.\r\nAttached, however, to the second pronouncement was a condition that\r\ndetracted, for Beale Farange, from its sweetness--an order that he\r\nshould refund to his late wife the twenty-six hundred pounds put down\r\nby her, as it was called, some three years before, in the interest of\r\nthe child\'s maintenance and precisely on a proved understanding that he\r\nwould take no proceedings: a sum of which he had had the administration\r\nand of which he could render not the least account. The obligation thus\r\nattributed to her adversary was no small balm to Ida\'s resentment; it\r\ndrew a part of the sting from her defeat and compelled Mr. Farange\r\nperceptibly to lower his crest. He was unable to produce the money or to\r\nraise it in any way; so that after a squabble scarcely less public and\r\nscarcely more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue\r\nfrom his predicament was a compromise proposed by his legal advisers and\r\nfinally accepted by hers.\r\n\r\nHis debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl\r\ndisposed of in a manner worthy of the judgement-seat of Solomon. She was\r\ndivided in two and the portions tossed impartially to the disputants.\r\nThey would take her, in rotation, for six months at a time; she would\r\nspend half the year with each. This was odd justice in the eyes of those\r\nwho still blinked in the fierce light projected from the tribunal--a\r\nlight in which neither parent figured in the least as a happy example to\r\nyouth and innocence. What was to have been expected on the evidence was\r\nthe nomination, _in loco parentis_, of some proper third person, some\r\nrespectable or at least some presentable friend. Apparently, however,\r\nthe circle of the Faranges had been scanned in vain for any such\r\nornament; so that the only solution finally meeting all the difficulties\r\nwas, save that of sending Maisie to a Home, the partition of the\r\ntutelary office in the manner I have mentioned. There were more reasons\r\nfor her parents to agree to it than there had ever been for them to\r\nagree to anything; and they now prepared with her help to enjoy the\r\ndistinction that waits upon vulgarity sufficiently attested. Their\r\nrupture had resounded, and after being perfectly insignificant\r\ntogether they would be decidedly striking apart. Had they not produced\r\nan impression that warranted people in looking for appeals in the\r\nnewspapers for the rescue of the little one--reverberation, amid a\r\nvociferous public, of the idea that some movement should be started or\r\nsome benevolent person should come forward? A good lady came indeed a\r\nstep or two: she was distantly related to Mrs. Farange, to whom she\r\nproposed that, having children and nurseries wound up and going, she\r\nshould be allowed to take home the bone of contention and, by working it\r\ninto her system, relieve at least one of the parents. This would make\r\nevery time, for Maisie, after her inevitable six months with Beale, much\r\nmore of a change.\r\n\r\n"More of a change?" Ida cried. "Won\'t it be enough of a change for her\r\nto come from that low brute to the person in the world who detests him\r\nmost?"\r\n\r\n"No, because you detest him so much that you\'ll always talk to her about\r\nhim. You\'ll keep him before her by perpetually abusing him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Farange stared. "Pray, then, am I to do nothing to counteract his\r\nvillainous abuse of ME?"\r\n\r\nThe good lady, for a moment, made no reply: her silence was a grim\r\njudgement of the whole point of view. "Poor little monkey!" she at\r\nlast exclaimed; and the words were an epitaph for the tomb of Maisie\'s\r\nchildhood. She was abandoned to her fate. What was clear to any\r\nspectator was that the only link binding her to either parent was this\r\nlamentable fact of her being a ready vessel for bitterness, a deep\r\nlittle porcelain cup in which biting acids could be mixed. They had\r\nwanted her not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they\r\ncould, with her unconscious aid, do each other. She should serve\r\ntheir anger and seal their revenge, for husband and wife had been\r\nalike crippled by the heavy hand of justice, which in the last resort\r\nmet on neither side their indignant claim to get, as they called it,\r\neverything. If each was only to get half this seemed to concede that\r\nneither was so base as the other pretended, or, to put it differently,\r\noffered them both as bad indeed, since they were only as good as each\r\nother. The mother had wished to prevent the father from, as she said,\r\n"so much as looking" at the child; the father\'s plea was that the\r\nmother\'s lightest touch was "simply contamination." These were the\r\nopposed principles in which Maisie was to be educated--she was to fit\r\nthem together as she might. Nothing could have been more touching at\r\nfirst than her failure to suspect the ordeal that awaited her little\r\nunspotted soul. There were persons horrified to think what those in\r\ncharge of it would combine to try to make of it: no one could conceive\r\nin advance that they would be able to make nothing ill.\r\n\r\nThis was a society in which for the most part people were occupied\r\nonly with chatter, but the disunited couple had at last grounds for\r\nexpecting a time of high activity. They girded their loins, they felt\r\nas if the quarrel had only begun. They felt indeed more married than\r\never, inasmuch as what marriage had mainly suggested to them was the\r\nunbroken opportunity to quarrel. There had been "sides" before, and\r\nthere were sides as much as ever; for the sider too the prospect\r\nopened out, taking the pleasant form of a superabundance of matter for\r\ndesultory conversation. The many friends of the Faranges drew together\r\nto differ about them; contradiction grew young again over teacups\r\nand cigars. Everybody was always assuring everybody of something\r\nvery shocking, and nobody would have been jolly if nobody had been\r\noutrageous. The pair appeared to have a social attraction which failed\r\nmerely as regards each other: it was indeed a great deal to be able\r\nto say for Ida that no one but Beale desired her blood, and for Beale\r\nthat if he should ever have his eyes scratched out it would be only by\r\nhis wife. It was generally felt, to begin with, that they were awfully\r\ngood-looking--they had really not been analysed to a deeper residuum.\r\nThey made up together for instance some twelve feet three of stature,\r\nand nothing was more discussed than the apportionment of this\r\nquantity. The sole flaw in Ida\'s beauty was a length and reach of\r\narm conducive perhaps to her having so often beaten her ex-husband\r\nat billiards, a game in which she showed a superiority largely\r\naccountable, as she maintained, for the resentment finding expression\r\nin his physical violence. Billiards was her great accomplishment\r\nand the distinction her name always first produced the mention of.\r\nNotwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might\r\nhave been large and that in many women profited by the licence was,\r\nwith a single exception, admired and cited for its smallness. The\r\nexception was her eyes, which might have been of mere regulation size,\r\nbut which overstepped the modesty of nature; her mouth, on the other\r\nhand, was barely perceptible, and odds were freely taken as to the\r\nmeasurement of her waist. She was a person who, when she was out--and\r\nshe was always out--produced everywhere a sense of having been seen\r\noften, the sense indeed of a kind of abuse of visibility, so that it\r\nwould have been, in the usual places rather vulgar to wonder at her.\r\nStrangers only did that; but they, to the amusement of the familiar,\r\ndid it very much: it was an inevitable way of betraying an alien\r\nhabit. Like her husband she carried clothes, carried them as a train\r\ncarries passengers: people had been known to compare their taste and\r\ndispute about the accommodation they gave these articles, though\r\ninclining on the whole to the commendation of Ida as less overcrowded,\r\nespecially with jewellery and flowers. Beale Farange had natural\r\ndecorations, a kind of costume in his vast fair beard, burnished like\r\na gold breastplate, and in the eternal glitter of the teeth that his\r\nlong moustache had been trained not to hide and that gave him, in\r\nevery possible situation, the look of the joy of life. He had been\r\ndestined in his youth for diplomacy and momentarily attached, without\r\na salary, to a legation which enabled him often to say "In MY time in\r\nthe East": but contemporary history had somehow had no use for him,\r\nhad hurried past him and left him in perpetual Piccadilly. Every one\r\nknew what he had--only twenty-five hundred. Poor Ida, who had run\r\nthrough everything, had now nothing but her carriage and her paralysed\r\nuncle. This old brute, as he was called, was supposed to have a lot\r\nput away. The child was provided for, thanks to a crafty godmother, a\r\ndefunct aunt of Beale\'s, who had left her something in such a manner\r\nthat the parents could appropriate only the income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child was provided for, but the new arrangement was inevitably\r\nconfounding to a young intelligence intensely aware that something had\r\nhappened which must matter a good deal and looking anxiously out for\r\nthe effects of so great a cause. It was to be the fate of this patient\r\nlittle girl to see much more than she at first understood, but also even\r\nat first to understand much more than any little girl, however patient,\r\nhad perhaps ever understood before. Only a drummer-boy in a ballad or\r\na story could have been so in the thick of the fight. She was taken\r\ninto the confidence of passions on which she fixed just the stare she\r\nmight have had for images bounding across the wall in the slide of a\r\nmagic-lantern. Her little world was phantasmagoric--strange shadows\r\ndancing on a sheet. It was as if the whole performance had been given\r\nfor her--a mite of a half-scared infant in a great dim theatre. She was\r\nin short introduced to life with a liberality in which the selfishness\r\nof others found its account, and there was nothing to avert the\r\nsacrifice but the modesty of her youth.\r\n\r\nHer first term was with her father, who spared her only in not letting\r\nher have the wild letters addressed to her by her mother: he confined\r\nhimself to holding them up at her and shaking them, while he showed his\r\nteeth, and then amusing her by the way he chucked them, across the room,\r\nbang into the fire. Even at that moment, however, she had a scared\r\nanticipation of fatigue, a guilty sense of not rising to the occasion,\r\nfeeling the charm of the violence with which the stiff unopened\r\nenvelopes, whose big monograms--Ida bristled with monograms--she would\r\nhave liked to see, were made to whizz, like dangerous missiles, through\r\nthe air. The greatest effect of the great cause was her own greater\r\nimportance, chiefly revealed to her in the larger freedom with which\r\nshe was handled, pulled hither and thither and kissed, and the\r\nproportionately greater niceness she was obliged to show. Her features\r\nhad somehow become prominent; they were so perpetually nipped by the\r\ngentlemen who came to see her father and the smoke of whose cigarettes\r\nwent into her face. Some of these gentlemen made her strike matches and\r\nlight their cigarettes; others, holding her on knees violently jolted,\r\npinched the calves of her legs till she shrieked--her shriek was much\r\nadmired--and reproached them with being toothpicks. The word stuck in\r\nher mind and contributed to her feeling from this time that she was\r\ndeficient in something that would meet the general desire. She found\r\nout what it was: it was a congenital tendency to the production of a\r\nsubstance to which Moddle, her nurse, gave a short ugly name, a name\r\npainfully associated at dinner with the part of the joint that she\r\ndidn\'t like. She had left behind her the time when she had no desires\r\nto meet, none at least save Moddle\'s, who, in Kensington Gardens, was\r\nalways on the bench when she came back to see if she had been playing\r\ntoo far. Moddle\'s desire was merely that she shouldn\'t do that, and she\r\nmet it so easily that the only spots in that long brightness were the\r\nmoments of her wondering what would become of her if, on her rushing\r\nback, there should be no Moddle on the bench. They still went to the\r\nGardens, but there was a difference even there; she was impelled\r\nperpetually to look at the legs of other children and ask her nurse if\r\nTHEY were toothpicks. Moddle was terribly truthful; she always said: "Oh\r\nmy dear, you\'ll not find such another pair as your own." It seemed to\r\nhave to do with something else that Moddle often said: "You feel the\r\nstrain--that\'s where it is; and you\'ll feel it still worse, you know."\r\n\r\nThus from the first Maisie not only felt it, but knew she felt it. A\r\npart of it was the consequence of her father\'s telling her he felt it\r\ntoo, and telling Moddle, in her presence, that she must make a point of\r\ndriving that home. She was familiar, at the age of six, with the fact\r\nthat everything had been changed on her account, everything ordered to\r\nenable him to give himself up to her. She was to remember always the\r\nwords in which Moddle impressed upon her that he did so give himself:\r\n"Your papa wishes you never to forget, you know, that he has been\r\ndreadfully put about." If the skin on Moddle\'s face had to Maisie the\r\nair of being unduly, almost painfully, stretched, it never presented\r\nthat appearance so much as when she uttered, as she often had occasion\r\nto utter, such words. The child wondered if they didn\'t make it hurt\r\nmore than usual; but it was only after some time that she was able to\r\nattach to the picture of her father\'s sufferings, and more particularly\r\nto her nurse\'s manner about them, the meaning for which these things\r\nhad waited. By the time she had grown sharper, as the gentlemen who had\r\ncriticised her calves used to say, she found in her mind a collection of\r\nimages and echoes to which meanings were attachable--images and echoes\r\nkept for her in the childish dusk, the dim closet, the high drawers,\r\nlike games she wasn\'t yet big enough to play. The great strain meanwhile\r\nwas that of carrying by the right end the things her father said about\r\nher mother--things mostly indeed that Moddle, on a glimpse of them, as\r\nif they had been complicated toys or difficult books, took out of her\r\nhands and put away in the closet. A wonderful assortment of objects of\r\nthis kind she was to discover there later, all tumbled up too with the\r\nthings, shuffled into the same receptacle, that her mother had said\r\nabout her father.\r\n\r\nShe had the knowledge that on a certain occasion which every day brought\r\nnearer her mother would be at the door to take her away, and this would\r\nhave darkened all the days if the ingenious Moddle hadn\'t written on a\r\npaper in very big easy words ever so many pleasures that she would enjoy\r\nat the other house. These promises ranged from "a mother\'s fond love"\r\nto "a nice poached egg to your tea," and took by the way the prospect\r\nof sitting up ever so late to see the lady in question dressed, in\r\nsilks and velvets and diamonds and pearls, to go out: so that it was a\r\nreal support to Maisie, at the supreme hour, to feel how, by Moddle\'s\r\ndirection, the paper was thrust away in her pocket and there clenched in\r\nher fist. The supreme hour was to furnish her with a vivid reminiscence,\r\nthat of a strange outbreak in the drawing-room on the part of Moddle,\r\nwho, in reply to something her father had just said, cried aloud: "You\r\nought to be perfectly ashamed of yourself--you ought to blush, sir, for\r\nthe way you go on!" The carriage, with her mother in it, was at the\r\ndoor; a gentleman who was there, who was always there, laughed out very\r\nloud; her father, who had her in his arms, said to Moddle: "My dear\r\nwoman, I\'ll settle you presently!"--after which he repeated, showing\r\nhis teeth more than ever at Maisie while he hugged her, the words for\r\nwhich her nurse had taken him up. Maisie was not at the moment so fully\r\nconscious of them as of the wonder of Moddle\'s sudden disrespect and\r\ncrimson face; but she was able to produce them in the course of five\r\nminutes when, in the carriage, her mother, all kisses, ribbons, eyes,\r\narms, strange sounds and sweet smells, said to her: "And did your\r\nbeastly papa, my precious angel, send any message to your own loving\r\nmamma?" Then it was that she found the words spoken by her beastly papa\r\nto be, after all, in her little bewildered ears, from which, at her\r\nmother\'s appeal, they passed, in her clear shrill voice, straight to\r\nher little innocent lips. "He said I was to tell you, from him," she\r\nfaithfully reported, "that you\'re a nasty horrid pig!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that lively sense of the immediate which is the very air of a child\'s\r\nmind the past, on each occasion, became for her as indistinct as\r\nthe future: she surrendered herself to the actual with a good faith\r\nthat might have been touching to either parent. Crudely as they had\r\ncalculated they were at first justified by the event: she was the little\r\nfeathered shuttlecock they could fiercely keep flying between them. The\r\nevil they had the gift of thinking or pretending to think of each other\r\nthey poured into her little gravely-gazing soul as into a boundless\r\nreceptacle, and each of them had doubtless the best conscience in the\r\nworld as to the duty of teaching her the stern truth that should be her\r\nsafeguard against the other. She was at the age for which all stories\r\nare true and all conceptions are stories. The actual was the absolute,\r\nthe present alone was vivid. The objurgation for instance launched\r\nin the carriage by her mother after she had at her father\'s bidding\r\npunctually performed was a missive that dropped into her memory with the\r\ndry rattle of a letter falling into a pillar-box. Like the letter it\r\nwas, as part of the contents of a well-stuffed post-bag, delivered in\r\ndue course at the right address. In the presence of these overflowings,\r\nafter they had continued for a couple of years, the associates of either\r\nparty sometimes felt that something should be done for what they called\r\n"the real good, don\'t you know?" of the child. The only thing done,\r\nhowever, in general, took place when it was sighingly remarked that she\r\nfortunately wasn\'t all the year round where she happened to be at the\r\nawkward moment, and that, furthermore, either from extreme cunning or\r\nfrom extreme stupidity, she appeared not to take things in.\r\n\r\nThe theory of her stupidity, eventually embraced by her parents,\r\ncorresponded with a great date in her small still life: the complete\r\nvision, private but final, of the strange office she filled. It was\r\nliterally a moral revolution and accomplished in the depths of her\r\nnature. The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms\r\nand legs; old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened\r\nher. She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; on which a new remedy\r\nrose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of\r\nconcealment. She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious\r\nspirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult,\r\nand that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so.\r\nHer parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed\r\nno longer. She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and\r\nwhen, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she\r\nbegan to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen.\r\nWhen therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before\r\nher that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real\r\ncontraction of her little stream of life. She spoiled their fun, but she\r\npractically added to her own. She saw more and more; she saw too much.\r\nIt was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion\r\nhad sown the seeds of secrecy; sown them not by anything she said, but\r\nby a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired. Moddle\r\nhad become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the\r\nchild had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance\r\nof hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the\r\nalphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise\r\nsomething her nurse described as "the important letter haitch." Miss\r\nOvermore, however hungry, never disappeared: this marked her somehow as\r\nof higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that\r\nMaisie supposed to be extraordinary. Mrs. Farange had described her as\r\nalmost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as\r\nBeale wasn\'t there. "Beale or no Beale," Maisie had heard her mother\r\nreply, "I take her because she\'s a lady and yet awfully poor. Rather\r\nnice people, but there are seven sisters at home. What do people mean?"\r\n\r\nMaisie didn\'t know what people meant, but she knew very soon all the\r\nnames of all the sisters; she could say them off better than she could\r\nsay the multiplication-table. She privately wondered moreover, though\r\nshe never asked, about the awful poverty, of which her companion also\r\nnever spoke. Food at any rate came up by mysterious laws; Miss Overmore\r\nnever, like Moddle, had on an apron, and when she ate she held her fork\r\nwith her little finger curled out. The child, who watched her at many\r\nmoments, watched her particularly at that one. "I think you\'re lovely,"\r\nshe often said to her; even mamma, who was lovely too, had not such a\r\npretty way with the fork. Maisie associated this showier presence with\r\nher now being "big," knowing of course that nursery-governesses were\r\nonly for little girls who were not, as she said, "really" little. She\r\nvaguely knew, further, somehow, that the future was still bigger than\r\nshe, and that a part of what made it so was the number of governesses\r\nlurking in it and ready to dart out. Everything that had happened\r\nwhen she was really little was dormant, everything but the positive\r\ncertitude, bequeathed from afar by Moddle, that the natural way for a\r\nchild to have her parents was separate and successive, like her mutton\r\nand her pudding or her bath and her nap.\r\n\r\n"DOES he know he lies?"--that was what she had vivaciously asked Miss\r\nOvermore on the occasion which was so suddenly to lead to a change in\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n"Does he know--" Miss Overmore stared; she had a stocking pulled over\r\nher hand and was pricking at it with a needle which she poised in the\r\nact. Her task was homely, but her movement, like all her movements,\r\ngraceful.\r\n\r\n"Why papa."\r\n\r\n"That he \'lies\'?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what mamma says I\'m to tell him--\'that he lies and he knows he\r\nlies.\'" Miss Overmore turned very red, though she laughed out till her\r\nhead fell back; then she pricked again at her muffled hand so hard\r\nthat Maisie wondered how she could bear it. "AM I to tell him?" the\r\nchild went on. It was then that her companion addressed her in the\r\nunmistakeable language of a pair of eyes of deep dark grey. "I can\'t say\r\nNo," they replied as distinctly as possible; "I can\'t say No, because\r\nI\'m afraid of your mamma, don\'t you see? Yet how can I say Yes after\r\nyour papa has been so kind to me, talking to me so long the other day,\r\nsmiling and flashing his beautiful teeth at me the time we met him in\r\nthe Park, the time when, rejoicing at the sight of us, he left the\r\ngentlemen he was with and turned and walked with us, stayed with us for\r\nhalf an hour?" Somehow in the light of Miss Overmore\'s lovely eyes that\r\nincident came back to Maisie with a charm it hadn\'t had at the time, and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that after it was over her governess had never\r\nbut once alluded to it. On their way home, when papa had quitted them,\r\nshe had expressed the hope that the child wouldn\'t mention it to mamma.\r\nMaisie liked her so, and had so the charmed sense of being liked by her,\r\nthat she accepted this remark as settling the matter and wonderingly\r\nconformed to it. The wonder now lived again, lived in the recollection\r\nof what papa had said to Miss Overmore: "I\'ve only to look at you to see\r\nyou\'re a person I can appeal to for help to save my daughter." Maisie\'s\r\nignorance of what she was to be saved from didn\'t diminish the pleasure\r\nof the thought that Miss Overmore was saving her. It seemed to make them\r\ncling together as in some wild game of "going round."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was therefore all the more startled when her mother said to her in\r\nconnexion with something to be done before her next migration: "You\r\nunderstand of course that she\'s not going with you."\r\n\r\nMaisie turned quite faint. "Oh I thought she was."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t in the least matter, you know, what you think," Mrs. Farange\r\nloudly replied; "and you had better indeed for the future, miss, learn\r\nto keep your thoughts to yourself." This was exactly what Maisie had\r\nalready learned, and the accomplishment was just the source of her\r\nmother\'s irritation. It was of a horrid little critical system, a\r\ntendency, in her silence, to judge her elders, that this lady suspected\r\nher, liking as she did, for her own part, a child to be simple and\r\nconfiding. She liked also to hear the report of the whacks she\r\nadministered to Mr. Farange\'s character, to his pretensions to peace\r\nof mind: the satisfaction of dealing them diminished when nothing came\r\nback. The day was at hand, and she saw it, when she should feel more\r\ndelight in hurling Maisie at him than in snatching her away; so much so\r\nthat her conscience winced under the acuteness of a candid friend who\r\nhad remarked that the real end of all their tugging would be that each\r\nparent would try to make the little girl a burden to the other--a sort\r\nof game in which a fond mother clearly wouldn\'t show to advantage. The\r\nprospect of not showing to advantage, a distinction in which she held\r\nshe had never failed, begot in Ida Farange an ill humour of which\r\nseveral persons felt the effect. She determined that Beale at any rate\r\nshould feel it; she reflected afresh that in the study of how to be\r\nodious to him she must never give way. Nothing could incommode him more\r\nthan not to get the good, for the child, of a nice female appendage who\r\nhad clearly taken a fancy to her. One of the things Ida said to the\r\nappendage was that Beale\'s was a house in which no decent woman could\r\nconsent to be seen. It was Miss Overmore herself who explained to\r\nMaisie that she had had a hope of being allowed to accompany her to her\r\nfather\'s, and that this hope had been dashed by the way her mother took\r\nit. "She says that if I ever do such a thing as enter his service I must\r\nnever expect to show my face in this house again. So I\'ve promised not\r\nto attempt to go with you. If I wait patiently till you come back here\r\nwe shall certainly be together once more."\r\n\r\nWaiting patiently, and above all waiting till she should come back\r\nthere, seemed to Maisie a long way round--it reminded her of all the\r\nthings she had been told, first and last, that she should have if she\'d\r\nbe good and that in spite of her goodness she had never had at all.\r\n"Then who\'ll take care of me at papa\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven only knows, my own precious!" Miss Overmore replied, tenderly\r\nembracing her. There was indeed no doubt that she was dear to this\r\nbeautiful friend. What could have proved it better than the fact that\r\nbefore a week was out, in spite of their distressing separation and her\r\nmother\'s prohibition and Miss Overmore\'s scruples and Miss Overmore\'s\r\npromise, the beautiful friend had turned up at her father\'s? The little\r\nlady already engaged there to come by the hour, a fat dark little lady\r\nwith a foreign name and dirty fingers, who wore, throughout, a bonnet\r\nthat had at first given her a deceptive air, too soon dispelled, of\r\nnot staying long, besides asking her pupil questions that had nothing\r\nto do with lessons, questions that Beale Farange himself, when two or\r\nthree were repeated to him, admitted to be awfully low--this strange\r\napparition faded before the bright creature who had braved everything\r\nfor Maisie\'s sake. The bright creature told her little charge frankly\r\nwhat had happened--that she had really been unable to hold out. She had\r\nbroken her vow to Mrs. Farange; she had struggled for three days and\r\nthen had come straight to Maisie\'s papa and told him the simple truth.\r\nShe adored his daughter; she couldn\'t give her up; she\'d make for her\r\nany sacrifice. On this basis it had been arranged that she should stay;\r\nher courage had been rewarded; she left Maisie in no doubt as to the\r\namount of courage she had required. Some of the things she said made\r\na particular impression on the child--her declaration for instance\r\nthat when her pupil should get older she\'d understand better just how\r\n"dreadfully bold" a young lady, to do exactly what she had done, had\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately your papa appreciates it; he appreciates it IMMENSELY"--\r\nthat was one of the things Miss Overmore also said, with a striking\r\ninsistence on the adverb. Maisie herself was no less impressed with\r\nwhat this martyr had gone through, especially after hearing of the\r\nterrible letter that had come from Mrs. Farange. Mamma had been so\r\nangry that, in Miss Overmore\'s own words, she had loaded her with\r\ninsult--proof enough indeed that they must never look forward to being\r\ntogether again under mamma\'s roof. Mamma\'s roof, however, had its turn,\r\nthis time, for the child, of appearing but remotely contingent, so that,\r\nto reassure her, there was scarce a need of her companion\'s secret,\r\nsolemnly confided--the probability there would be no going back to mamma\r\nat all. It was Miss Overmore\'s private conviction, and a part of the\r\nsame communication, that if Mr. Farange\'s daughter would only show a\r\nreally marked preference she would be backed up by "public opinion" in\r\nholding on to him. Poor Maisie could scarcely grasp that incentive, but\r\nshe could surrender herself to the day. She had conceived her first\r\npassion, and the object of it was her governess. It hadn\'t been put to\r\nher, and she couldn\'t, or at any rate she didn\'t, put it to herself,\r\nthat she liked Miss Overmore better than she liked papa; but it would\r\nhave sustained her under such an imputation to feel herself able\r\nto reply that papa too liked Miss Overmore exactly as much. He had\r\nparticularly told her so. Besides she could easily see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this led her on, but it brought on her fate as well, the day when\r\nher mother would be at the door in the carriage in which Maisie now rode\r\non no occasions but these. There was no question at present of Miss\r\nOvermore\'s going back with her: it was universally recognised that her\r\nquarrel with Mrs. Farange was much too acute. The child felt it from\r\nthe first; there was no hugging nor exclaiming as that lady drove her\r\naway--there was only a frightening silence, unenlivened even by the\r\ninvidious enquiries of former years, which culminated, according to its\r\nstern nature, in a still more frightening old woman, a figure awaiting\r\nher on the very doorstep. "You\'re to be under this lady\'s care," said\r\nher mother. "Take her, Mrs. Wix," she added, addressing the figure\r\nimpatiently and giving the child a push from which Maisie gathered that\r\nshe wished to set Mrs. Wix an example of energy. Mrs. Wix took her and,\r\nMaisie felt the next day, would never let her go. She had struck her at\r\nfirst, just after Miss Overmore, as terrible; but something in her voice\r\nat the end of an hour touched the little girl in a spot that had never\r\neven yet been reached. Maisie knew later what it was, though doubtless\r\nshe couldn\'t have made a statement of it: these were things that a few\r\ndays\' talk with Mrs. Wix quite lighted up. The principal one was a\r\nmatter Mrs. Wix herself always immediately mentioned: she had had a\r\nlittle girl quite of her own, and the little girl had been killed on\r\nthe spot. She had had absolutely nothing else in all the world, and her\r\naffliction had broken her heart. It was comfortably established between\r\nthem that Mrs. Wix\'s heart was broken. What Maisie felt was that she had\r\nbeen, with passion and anguish, a mother, and that this was something\r\nMiss Overmore was not, something (strangely, confusingly) that mamma was\r\neven less.\r\n\r\nSo it was that in the course of an extraordinarily short time she\r\nfound herself as deeply absorbed in the image of the little dead\r\nClara Matilda, who, on a crossing in the Harrow Road, had been knocked\r\ndown and crushed by the cruellest of hansoms, as she had ever found\r\nherself in the family group made vivid by one of seven. "She\'s your\r\nlittle dead sister," Mrs. Wix ended by saying, and Maisie, all in\r\na tremor of curiosity and compassion, addressed from that moment a\r\nparticular piety to the small accepted acquisition. Somehow she wasn\'t\r\na real sister, but that only made her the more romantic. It contributed\r\nto this view of her that she was never to be spoken of in that character\r\nto any one else--least of all to Mrs. Farange, who wouldn\'t care for\r\nher nor recognise the relationship: it was to be just an unutterable and\r\ninexhaustible little secret with Mrs. Wix. Maisie knew everything about\r\nher that could be known, everything she had said or done in her little\r\nmutilated life, exactly how lovely she was, exactly how her hair was\r\ncurled and her frocks were trimmed. Her hair came down far below her\r\nwaist--it was of the most wonderful golden brightness, just as Mrs.\r\nWix\'s own had been a long time before. Mrs. Wix\'s own was indeed very\r\nremarkable still, and Maisie had felt at first that she should never get\r\non with it. It played a large part in the sad and strange appearance,\r\nthe appearance as of a kind of greasy greyness, which Mrs. Wix had\r\npresented on the child\'s arrival. It had originally been yellow, but\r\ntime had turned that elegance to ashes, to a turbid sallow unvenerable\r\nwhite. Still excessively abundant, it was dressed in a manner of which\r\nthe poor lady appeared not yet to have recognised the supersession, with\r\na glossy braid, like a large diadem, on the top of the head, and behind,\r\nat the nape of the neck, a dingy rosette like a large button. She wore\r\nglasses which, in humble reference to a divergent obliquity of vision,\r\nshe called her straighteners, and a little ugly snuff-coloured dress\r\ntrimmed with satin bands in the form of scallops and glazed with\r\nantiquity. The straighteners, she explained to Maisie, were put on for\r\nthe sake of others, whom, as she believed, they helped to recognise the\r\nbearing, otherwise doubtful, of her regard; the rest of the melancholy\r\ngarb could only have been put on for herself. With the added suggestion\r\nof her goggles it reminded her pupil of the polished shell or corslet\r\nof a horrid beetle. At first she had looked cross and almost cruel; but\r\nthis impression passed away with the child\'s increased perception of\r\nher being in the eyes of the world a figure mainly to laugh at. She\r\nwas as droll as a charade or an animal toward the end of the "natural\r\nhistory"--a person whom people, to make talk lively, described to each\r\nother and imitated. Every one knew the straighteners; every one knew the\r\ndiadem and the button, the scallops and satin bands; every one, though\r\nMaisie had never betrayed her, knew even Clara Matilda.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of these things that mamma got her for such low pay,\r\nreally for nothing: so much, one day when Mrs. Wix had accompanied her\r\ninto the drawing-room and left her, the child heard one of the ladies\r\nshe found there--a lady with eyebrows arched like skipping-ropes and\r\nthick black stitching, like ruled lines for musical notes on beautiful\r\nwhite gloves--announce to another. She knew governesses were poor; Miss\r\nOvermore was unmentionably and Mrs. Wix ever so publicly so. Neither\r\nthis, however, nor the old brown frock nor the diadem nor the button,\r\nmade a difference for Maisie in the charm put forth through everything,\r\nthe charm of Mrs. Wix\'s conveying that somehow, in her ugliness and her\r\npoverty, she was peculiarly and soothingly safe; safer than any one\r\nin the world, than papa, than mamma, than the lady with the arched\r\neyebrows; safer even, though so much less beautiful, than Miss Overmore,\r\non whose loveliness, as she supposed it, the little girl was faintly\r\nconscious that one couldn\'t rest with quite the same tucked-in and\r\nkissed-for-good-night feeling. Mrs. Wix was as safe as Clara Matilda,\r\nwho was in heaven and yet, embarrassingly, also in Kensal Green, where\r\nthey had been together to see her little huddled grave. It was from\r\nsomething in Mrs. Wix\'s tone, which in spite of caricature remained\r\nindescribable and inimitable, that Maisie, before her term with her\r\nmother was over, drew this sense of a support, like a breast-high\r\nbanister in a place of "drops," that would never give way. If she knew\r\nher instructress was poor and queer she also knew she was not nearly so\r\n"qualified" as Miss Overmore, who could say lots of dates straight off\r\n(letting you hold the book yourself), state the position of Malabar, play\r\nsix pieces without notes and, in a sketch, put in beautifully the trees\r\nand houses and difficult parts. Maisie herself could play more pieces\r\nthan Mrs. Wix, who was moreover visibly ashamed of her houses and trees\r\nand could only, with the help of a smutty forefinger, of doubtful\r\nlegitimacy in the field of art, do the smoke coming out of the chimneys.\r\nThey dealt, the governess and her pupil, in "subjects," but there were\r\nmany the governess put off from week to week and that they never got to\r\nat all: she only used to say "We\'ll take that in its proper order." Her\r\norder was a circle as vast as the untravelled globe. She had not the\r\nspirit of adventure--the child could perfectly see how many subjects she\r\nwas afraid of. She took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, through\r\nwhich indeed there curled the blue river of truth. She knew swarms of\r\nstories, mostly those of the novels she had read; relating them with\r\na memory that never faltered and a wealth of detail that was Maisie\'s\r\ndelight. They were all about love and beauty and countesses and\r\nwickedness. Her conversation was practically an endless narrative,\r\na great garden of romance, with sudden vistas into her own life and\r\ngushing fountains of homeliness. These were the parts where they most\r\nlingered; she made the child take with her again every step of her long,\r\nlame course and think it beyond magic or monsters. Her pupil acquired a\r\nvivid vision of every one who had ever, in her phrase, knocked against\r\nher--some of them oh so hard!--every one literally but Mr. Wix, her\r\nhusband, as to whom nothing was mentioned save that he had been dead for\r\nages. He had been rather remarkably absent from his wife\'s career, and\r\nMaisie was never taken to see his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second parting from Miss Overmore had been bad enough, but this\r\nfirst parting from Mrs. Wix was much worse. The child had lately been to\r\nthe dentist\'s and had a term of comparison for the screwed-up intensity\r\nof the scene. It was dreadfully silent, as it had been when her tooth\r\nwas taken out; Mrs. Wix had on that occasion grabbed her hand and they\r\nhad clung to each other with the frenzy of their determination not to\r\nscream. Maisie, at the dentist\'s, had been heroically still, but just\r\nwhen she felt most anguish had become aware of an audible shriek on the\r\npart of her companion, a spasm of stifled sympathy. This was reproduced\r\nby the only sound that broke their supreme embrace when, a month later,\r\nthe "arrangement," as her periodical uprootings were called, played the\r\npart of the horrible forceps. Embedded in Mrs. Wix\'s nature as her tooth\r\nhad been socketed in her gum, the operation of extracting her would\r\nreally have been a case for chloroform. It was a hug that fortunately\r\nleft nothing to say, for the poor woman\'s want of words at such an\r\nhour seemed to fall in with her want of everything. Maisie\'s alternate\r\nparent, in the outermost vestibule--he liked the impertinence of\r\ncrossing as much as that of his late wife\'s threshold--stood over them\r\nwith his open watch and his still more open grin, while from the only\r\ncorner of an eye on which something of Mrs. Wix\'s didn\'t impinge the\r\nchild saw at the door a brougham in which Miss Overmore also waited.\r\nShe remembered the difference when, six months before, she had been\r\ntorn from the breast of that more spirited protectress. Miss Overmore,\r\nthen also in the vestibule, but of course in the other one, had been\r\nthoroughly audible and voluble; her protest had rung out bravely and she\r\nhad declared that something--her pupil didn\'t know exactly what--was\r\na regular wicked shame. That had at the time dimly recalled to Maisie\r\nthe far-away moment of Moddle\'s great outbreak: there seemed always to\r\nbe "shames" connected in one way or another with her migrations. At\r\npresent, while Mrs. Wix\'s arms tightened and the smell of her hair was\r\nstrong, she further remembered how, in pacifying Miss Overmore, papa had\r\nmade use of the words "you dear old duck!"--an expression which, by its\r\noddity, had stuck fast in her young mind, having moreover a place well\r\nprepared for it there by what she knew of the governess whom she now\r\nalways mentally characterised as the pretty one. She wondered whether\r\nthis affection would be as great as before: that would at all events be\r\nthe case with the prettiness Maisie could see in the face which showed\r\nbrightly at the window of the brougham.\r\n\r\nThe brougham was a token of harmony, of the fine conditions papa would\r\nthis time offer: he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a\r\nfour-wheeler behind for the boxes. The four-wheeler with the boxes on it\r\nwas actually there, but mamma was the only lady with whom she had ever\r\nbeen in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a\r\nprivate carriage. Papa\'s carriage was, now that he had one, still more\r\nprivate, somehow, than mamma\'s; and when at last she found herself quite\r\non top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she\r\nput to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a\r\nquestion of which the motive was a desire for information as to the\r\ncontinuity of a certain sentiment. "Did papa like you just the same\r\nwhile I was gone?" she enquired--full of the sense of how markedly his\r\nfavour had been established in her presence. She had bethought herself\r\nthat this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be\r\nonly intermittent and for the season. Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst\r\ninto one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was,\r\nseemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and\r\nmake her jump. Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied: "Why, you\r\nlittle donkey, when you\'re away what have I left to do but just to love\r\nher?" Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had\r\na merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised\r\nperception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria.\r\nThen her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely: "I shall make\r\nhim understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that\r\nto you I shall carry you straight off and we\'ll go and live somewhere\r\ntogether and be good quiet little girls." The child couldn\'t quite make\r\nout why her father\'s speech had been horrid, since it only expressed\r\nthat appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as\r\n"immense." To enter more into the truth of the matter she appealed to\r\nhim again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn\'t\r\nbeen with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now.\r\n"Of course she has, old girl--where else could the poor dear be?" cried\r\nBeale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who\r\nprotested that unless he straightway "took back" his nasty wicked fib\r\nit would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too\r\nand his house and his tiresome trouble--all the impossible things he\r\nhad succeeded in putting on her. Beale, under this frolic menace, took\r\nnothing back at all; he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating\r\nhis extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that\r\nshe was not to listen to his bad jokes: she was to understand that a\r\nlady couldn\'t stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nMaisie looked from one of her companions to the other; this was the\r\nfreshest gayest start she had yet enjoyed, but she had a shy fear of not\r\nexactly believing them. "Well, what reason IS proper?" she thoughtfully\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh a long-legged stick of a tomboy: there\'s none so good as that." Her\r\nfather enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get\r\npossession of her--an effort deprecated by their comrade and leading\r\nagain to something of a public scuffle. Miss Overmore declared to the\r\nchild that she had been all the while with good friends; on which Beale\r\nFarange went on: "She means good friends of mine, you know--tremendous\r\nfriends of mine. There has been no end of THEM about--that I WILL say\r\nfor her!" Maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time\r\nconscious of a vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to the subject\r\nof so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been.\r\nShe didn\'t feel at all as if she had been seriously told, and no such\r\nfeeling was supplied by anything that occurred later. Her embarrassment,\r\nof a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that\r\nthis was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used\r\nto say, to go into. Therefore, under her father\'s roof during the time\r\nthat followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an\r\ningratiating way with housemaids; and it was an odd truth that the\r\nambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by\r\nrenewed contact with Miss Overmore. The confidence looked for by that\r\nyoung lady was of the fine sort that explanation can\'t improve, and she\r\nherself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion. For Maisie\r\nmoreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception; she had\r\ngrown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that\r\nshe was never to ask about them. It was far from new to her that the\r\nquestions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great: except\r\nthe affairs of her doll Lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at\r\nher mother\'s that was explicable with a grave face. Nothing was so easy\r\nto her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks, and\r\nshe might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more\r\ncalculating turn. Everything had something behind it: life was like a\r\nlong, long corridor with rows of closed doors. She had learned that at\r\nthese doors it was wise not to knock--this seemed to produce from within\r\nsuch sounds of derision. Little by little, however, she understood more,\r\nfor it befell that she was enlightened by Lisette\'s questions, which\r\nreproduced the effect of her own upon those for whom she sat in the very\r\ndarkness of Lisette. Was she not herself convulsed by such innocence? In\r\nthe presence of it she often imitated the shrieking ladies. There were\r\nat any rate things she really couldn\'t tell even a French doll. She\r\ncould only pass on her lessons and study to produce on Lisette the\r\nimpression of having mysteries in her life, wondering the while whether\r\nshe succeeded in the air of shading off, like her mother, into the\r\nunknowable. When the reign of Miss Overmore followed that of Mrs. Wix\r\nshe took a fresh cue, emulating her governess and bridging over the\r\ninterval with the simple expectation of trust. Yes, there were matters\r\none couldn\'t "go into" with a pupil. There were for instance days when,\r\nafter prolonged absence, Lisette, watching her take off her things,\r\ntried hard to discover where she had been. Well, she discovered a\r\nlittle, but never discovered all. There was an occasion when, on her\r\nbeing particularly indiscreet, Maisie replied to her--and precisely\r\nabout the motive of a disappearance--as she, Maisie, had once been\r\nreplied to by Mrs. Farange: "Find out for yourself!" She mimicked her\r\nmother\'s sharpness, but she was rather ashamed afterwards, though as\r\nto whether of the sharpness or of the mimicry was not quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nShe became aware in time that this phase wouldn\'t have shone by\r\nlessons, the care of her education being now only one of the many\r\nduties devolving on Miss Overmore; a devolution as to which she was\r\npresent at various passages between that lady and her father--passages\r\nsignificant, on either side, of dissent and even of displeasure. It was\r\ngathered by the child on these occasions that there was something in the\r\nsituation for which her mother might "come down" on them all, though\r\nindeed the remark, always dropped by her father, was greeted on his\r\ncompanion\'s part with direct contradiction. Such scenes were usually\r\nbrought to a climax by Miss Overmore\'s demanding, with more asperity\r\nthan she applied to any other subject, in what position under the sun\r\nsuch a person as Mrs. Farange would find herself for coming down. As the\r\nmonths went on the little girl\'s interpretations thickened, and the more\r\neffectually that this stretch was the longest she had known without a\r\nbreak. She got used to the idea that her mother, for some reason, was\r\nin no hurry to reinstate her: that idea was forcibly expressed by her\r\nfather whenever Miss Overmore, differing and decided, took him up on the\r\nquestion, which he was always putting forward, of the urgency of sending\r\nher to school. For a governess Miss Overmore differed surprisingly; far\r\nmore for instance than would have entered into the bowed head of Mrs.\r\nWix. She observed to Maisie many times that she was quite conscious of\r\nnot doing her justice, and that Mr. Farange equally measured and equally\r\nlamented this deficiency. The reason of it was that she had mysterious\r\nresponsibilities that interfered--responsibilities, Miss Overmore\r\nintimated, to Mr. Farange himself and to the friendly noisy little house\r\nand those who came there. Mr. Farange\'s remedy for every inconvenience\r\nwas that the child should be put at school--there were such lots of\r\nsplendid schools, as everybody knew, at Brighton and all over the place.\r\nThat, however, Maisie learned, was just what would bring her mother\r\ndown: from the moment he should delegate to others the housing of his\r\nlittle charge he hadn\'t a leg to stand on before the law. Didn\'t he keep\r\nher away from her mother precisely because Mrs. Farange was one of these\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nThere was also the solution of a second governess, a young person to\r\ncome in by the day and really do the work; but to this Miss Overmore\r\nwouldn\'t for a moment listen, arguing against it with great public\r\nrelish and wanting to know from all comers--she put it even to Maisie\r\nherself--they didn\'t see how frightfully it would give her away. "What\r\nam I supposed to be at all, don\'t you see, if I\'m not here to look\r\nafter her?" She was in a false position and so freely and loudly called\r\nattention to it that it seemed to become almost a source of glory. The\r\nway out of it of course was just to do her plain duty; but that was\r\nunfortunately what, with his excessive, his exorbitant demands on her,\r\nwhich every one indeed appeared quite to understand, he practically, he\r\nselfishly prevented. Beale Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never\r\nanything but "he," and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen\r\nwith whom, under that designation, she chaffingly talked about him.\r\nMaisie meanwhile, as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done\r\nwith her, was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful\r\nthought of the large loose discipline of Mrs. Wix; yet she none the less\r\nheld it under her father\'s roof a point of superiority that none of his\r\nvisitors were ladies. It added to this odd security that she had once\r\nheard a gentleman say to him as if it were a great joke and in obvious\r\nreference to Miss Overmore: "Hanged if she\'ll let another woman come\r\nnear you--hanged if she ever will. She\'d let fly a stick at her as they\r\ndo at a strange cat!" Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates\r\nin spite of their also having their way--louder but sooner over--of\r\nlaughing out at her. They pulled and pinched, they teased and tickled\r\nher; some of them even, as they termed it, shied things at her, and all\r\nof them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to\r\nher own. The ladies on the other hand addressed her as "You poor pet"\r\nand scarcely touched her even to kiss her. But it was of the ladies she\r\nwas most afraid.\r\n\r\nShe was now old enough to understand how disproportionate a stay she had\r\nalready made with her father; and also old enough to enter a little into\r\nthe ambiguity attending this excess, which oppressed her particularly\r\nwhenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess.\r\n"Oh you needn\'t worry: she doesn\'t care!" Miss Overmore had often\r\nsaid to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her\r\nprolonged detention. "She has other people than poor little YOU to\r\nthink about, and has gone abroad with them; so you needn\'t be in the\r\nleast afraid she\'ll stickle this time for her rights." Maisie knew Mrs.\r\nFarange had gone abroad, for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter\r\nfrom her beginning "My precious pet" and taking leave of her for an\r\nindeterminate time; but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred\r\nor of the writer\'s policy of asserting herself, for the sharpest of all\r\nher impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever\r\ncare so much about as to torment Mr. Farange. What at last, however, was\r\nin this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a\r\nsuspicion that a better way had been found to torment Mr. Farange than\r\nto deprive him of his periodical burden. This was the question that\r\nworried our young lady and that Miss Overmore\'s confidences and the\r\nfrequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying. It\r\nwas a contradiction that if Ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights\r\nshe had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldn\'t jump at\r\nthe monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely\r\nfought; but when Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, sounded this\r\nnew ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly\r\nabused. Miss Overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent\r\nreserve, but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness\r\nnot inferior to Beale\'s own on the subject of the lady who had fled to\r\nthe Continent to wriggle out of her job. It would serve this lady right,\r\nMaisie gathered, if that contract, in the shape of an overgrown and\r\nunderdressed daughter, should be shipped straight out to her and landed\r\nat her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses.\r\n\r\nThe picture of these pursuits was what Miss Overmore took refuge in when\r\nthe child tried timidly to ascertain if her father were disposed to feel\r\nhe had too much of her. She evaded the point and only kicked up all\r\nround it the dust of Ida\'s heartlessness and folly, of which the supreme\r\nproof, it appeared, was the fact that she was accompanied on her journey\r\nby a gentleman whom, to be painfully plain on it, she had--well, "picked\r\nup." The terms on which, unless they were married, ladies and gentlemen\r\nmight, as Miss Overmore expressed it, knock about together, were the\r\nterms on which she and Mr. Farange had exposed themselves to possible\r\nmisconception. She had indeed, as has been noted, often explained this\r\nbefore, often said to Maisie: "I don\'t know what in the world, darling,\r\nyour father and I should do without you, for you just make the\r\ndifference, as I\'ve told you, of keeping us perfectly proper." The child\r\ntook in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she\r\nperformed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the\r\nevent of her mother\'s giving her up. Familiar as she had grown with the\r\nfact of the great alternative to the proper, she felt in her governess\r\nand her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment. At the\r\nsame time she had heard somehow of little girls--of exalted rank, it was\r\ntrue--whose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex,\r\nand she knew that if she were at school at Brighton it would be thought\r\nan advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters. She\r\nturned these things over and remarked to Miss Overmore that if she\r\nshould go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor.\r\n\r\n"The gentleman?" The proposition was complicated enough to make Miss\r\nOvermore stare.\r\n\r\n"The one who\'s with mamma. Mightn\'t that make it right--as right as your\r\nbeing my governess makes it for you to be with papa?"\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore considered; she coloured a little; then she embraced her\r\ningenious friend. "You\'re too sweet! I\'m a REAL governess."\r\n\r\n"And couldn\'t he be a real tutor?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not. He\'s ignorant and bad."\r\n\r\n"Bad--?" Maisie echoed with wonder.\r\n\r\nHer companion gave a queer little laugh at her tone. "He\'s ever so much\r\nyounger--" But that was all.\r\n\r\n"Younger than you?"\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore laughed again; it was the first time Maisie had seen her\r\napproach so nearly to a giggle.\r\n\r\n"Younger than--no matter whom. I don\'t know anything about him and don\'t\r\nwant to," she rather inconsequently added. "He\'s not my sort, and I\'m\r\nsure, my own darling, he\'s not yours." And she repeated the free caress\r\ninto which her colloquies with Maisie almost always broke and which made\r\nthe child feel that HER affection at least was a gage of safety. Parents\r\nhad come to seem vague, but governesses were evidently to be trusted.\r\nMaisie\'s faith in Mrs. Wix for instance had suffered no lapse from the\r\nfact that all communication with her had temporarily dropped. During the\r\nfirst weeks of their separation Clara Matilda\'s mamma had repeatedly and\r\ndolefully written to her, and Maisie had answered with an enthusiasm\r\ncontrolled only by orthographical doubts; but the correspondence had\r\nbeen duly submitted to Miss Overmore, with the final effect of its not\r\nsuiting her. It was this lady\'s view that Mr. Farange wouldn\'t care for\r\nit at all, and she ended by confessing--since her pupil pushed her--that\r\nshe didn\'t care for it herself. She was furiously jealous, she said; and\r\nthat weakness was but a new proof of her disinterested affection. She\r\npronounced Mrs. Wix\'s effusions moreover illiterate and unprofitable;\r\nshe made no scruple of declaring it monstrous that a woman in her\r\nsenses should have placed the formation of her daughter\'s mind in such\r\nridiculous hands. Maisie was well aware that the proprietress of the old\r\nbrown dress and the old odd headgear was lower in the scale of "form"\r\nthan Miss Overmore; but it was now brought home to her with pain that\r\nshe was educationally quite out of the question. She was buried for the\r\ntime beneath a conclusive remark of her critic\'s: "She\'s really beyond a\r\njoke!" This remark was made as that charming woman held in her hand the\r\nlast letter that Maisie was to receive from Mrs. Wix; it was fortified\r\nby a decree proscribing the preposterous tie. "Must I then write and\r\ntell her?" the child bewilderedly asked: she grew pale at the dreadful\r\nthings it appeared involved for her to say. "Don\'t dream of it, my\r\ndear--I\'ll write: you may trust me!" cried Miss Overmore; who indeed\r\nwrote to such purpose that a hush in which you could have heard a pin\r\ndrop descended upon poor Mrs. Wix. She gave for weeks and weeks no sign\r\nwhatever of life: it was as if she had been as effectually disposed of\r\nby Miss Overmore\'s communication as her little girl, in the Harrow Road,\r\nhad been disposed of by the terrible hansom. Her very silence became\r\nafter this one of the largest elements of Maisie\'s consciousness; it\r\nproved a warm and habitable air, into which the child penetrated further\r\nthan she dared ever to mention to her companions. Somewhere in the\r\ndepths of it the dim straighteners were fixed upon her; somewhere out of\r\nthe troubled little current Mrs. Wix intensely waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt quite fell in with this intensity that one day, on returning from\r\na walk with the housemaid, Maisie should have found her in the hall,\r\nseated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraph-boys who haunted\r\nBeale Farange\'s door and kicked their heels while, in his room, answers\r\nto their missives took form with the aid of smoke-puffs and growls. It\r\nhad seemed to her on their parting that Mrs. Wix had reached the last\r\nlimits of the squeeze, but she now felt those limits to be transcended\r\nand that the duration of her visitor\'s hug was a direct reply to Miss\r\nOvermore\'s veto. She understood in a flash how the visit had come to be\r\npossible--that Mrs. Wix, watching her chance, must have slipped in under\r\nprotection of the fact that papa, always tormented in spite of arguments\r\nwith the idea of a school, had, for a three days\' excursion to Brighton,\r\nabsolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary. It was true that\r\nwhen Maisie explained their absence and their important motive Mrs. Wix\r\nwore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in\r\nsurprise. This contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish, for at\r\nthe very moment that, in the spirit of it, she threw herself afresh upon\r\nher young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the\r\ndoor and Miss Overmore bounded out. The shock of her encounter with Mrs.\r\nWix was less violent than Maisie had feared on seeing her and didn\'t\r\nat all interfere with the sociable tone in which, under her rival\'s\r\neyes, she explained to her little charge that she had returned, for a\r\nparticular reason, a day sooner than she first intended. She had left\r\npapa--in such nice lodgings--at Brighton; but he would come back to\r\nhis dear little home on the morrow. As for Mrs. Wix, papa\'s companion\r\nsupplied Maisie in later converse with the right word for the attitude\r\nof this personage: Mrs. Wix "stood up" to her in a manner that the child\r\nherself felt at the time to be astonishing. This occurred indeed after\r\nMiss Overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the\r\ndining-room, where, in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down,\r\nit was scarcely more than natural that even poor Mrs. Wix should stand\r\nup. Maisie at once enquired if at Brighton, this time, anything had\r\ncome of the possibility of a school; to which, much to her surprise,\r\nMiss Overmore, who had always grandly repudiated it, replied after an\r\ninstant, but quite as if Mrs. Wix were not there:\r\n\r\n"It may be, darling, that something WILL come. The objection, I must\r\ntell you, has been quite removed."\r\n\r\nAt this it was still more startling to hear Mrs. Wix speak out with\r\ngreat firmness. "I don\'t think, if you\'ll allow me to say so, that\r\nthere\'s any arrangement by which the objection CAN be \'removed.\' What\r\nhas brought me here to-day is that I\'ve a message for Maisie from dear\r\nMrs. Farange."\r\n\r\nThe child\'s heart gave a great thump. "Oh mamma\'s come back?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, sweet love, but she\'s coming," said Mrs. Wix, "and she\r\nhas--most thoughtfully, you know--sent me on to prepare you."\r\n\r\n"To prepare her for what, pray?" asked Miss Overmore, whose first\r\nsmoothness began, with this news, to be ruffled.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix quietly applied her straighteners to Miss Overmore\'s flushed\r\nbeauty. "Well, miss, for a very important communication."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t dear Mrs. Farange, as you so oddly call her, make her\r\ncommunications directly? Can\'t she take the trouble to write to her only\r\ndaughter?" the younger lady demanded. "Maisie herself will tell you that\r\nit\'s months and months since she has had so much as a word from her."\r\n\r\n"Oh but I\'ve written to mamma!" cried the child as if this would do\r\nquite as well.\r\n\r\n"That makes her treatment of you all the greater scandal," the governess\r\nin possession promptly declared.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Farange is too well aware," said Mrs. Wix with sustained spirit,\r\n"of what becomes of her letters in this house."\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s sense of fairness hereupon interposed for her visitor. "You\r\nknow, Miss Overmore, that papa doesn\'t like everything of mamma\'s."\r\n\r\n"No one likes, my dear, to be made the subject of such language as your\r\nmother\'s letters contain. They were not fit for the innocent child to\r\nsee," Miss Overmore observed to Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t know what you complain of, and she\'s better without them.\r\nIt serves every purpose that I\'m in Mrs. Farange\'s confidence."\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore gave a scornful laugh. "Then you must be mixed up with\r\nsome extraordinary proceedings!"\r\n\r\n"None so extraordinary," cried Mrs. Wix, turning very pale, "as to say\r\nhorrible things about the mother to the face of the helpless daughter!"\r\n\r\n"Things not a bit more horrible, I think," Miss Overmore returned, "than\r\nthose you, madam, appear to have come here to say about the father!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked for a moment hard at Maisie, and then, turning again to\r\nthis witness, spoke with a trembling voice. "I came to say nothing about\r\nhim, and you must excuse Mrs. Farange and me if we\'re not so above all\r\nreproach as the companion of his travels."\r\n\r\nThe young woman thus described stared at the apparent breadth of the\r\ndescription--she needed a moment to take it in. Maisie, however, gazing\r\nsolemnly from one of the disputants to the other, noted that her answer,\r\nwhen it came, perched upon smiling lips. "It will do quite as well,\r\nno doubt, if you come up to the requirements of the companion of Mrs.\r\nFarange\'s!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix broke into a queer laugh; it sounded to Maisie an unsuccessful\r\nimitation of a neigh. "That\'s just what I\'m here to make known--how\r\nperfectly the poor lady comes up to them herself." She held up her head\r\nat the child. "You must take your mamma\'s message, Maisie, and you must\r\nfeel that her wishing me to come to you with it this way is a great\r\nproof of interest and affection. She sends you her particular love and\r\nannounces to you that she\'s engaged to be married to Sir Claude."\r\n\r\n"Sir Claude?" Maisie wonderingly echoed. But while Mrs. Wix explained\r\nthat this gentleman was a dear friend of Mrs. Farange\'s, who had been\r\nof great assistance to her in getting to Florence and in making herself\r\ncomfortable there for the winter, she was not too violently shaken to\r\nperceive her old friend\'s enjoyment of the effect of this news on Miss\r\nOvermore. That young lady opened her eyes very wide; she immediately\r\nremarked that Mrs. Farange\'s marriage would of course put an end to any\r\nfurther pretension to take her daughter back. Mrs. Wix enquired with\r\nastonishment why it should do anything of the sort, and Miss Overmore\r\ngave as an instant reason that it was clearly but another dodge in a\r\nsystem of dodges. She wanted to get out of the bargain: why else had she\r\nnow left Maisie on her father\'s hands weeks and weeks beyond the time\r\nabout which she had originally made such a fuss? It was vain for Mrs.\r\nWix to represent--as she speciously proceeded to do--that all this time\r\nwould be made up as soon as Mrs. Farange returned: she, Miss Overmore,\r\nknew nothing, thank heaven, about her confederate, but was very sure\r\nany person capable of forming that sort of relation with the lady in\r\nFlorence would easily agree to object to the presence in his house\r\nof the fruit of a union that his dignity must ignore. It was a game\r\nlike another, and Mrs. Wix\'s visit was clearly the first move in it.\r\nMaisie found in this exchange of asperities a fresh incitement to the\r\nunformulated fatalism in which her sense of her own career had long\r\nsince taken refuge; and it was the beginning for her of a deeper\r\nprevision that, in spite of Miss Overmore\'s brilliancy and Mrs. Wix\'s\r\npassion, she should live to see a change in the nature of the struggle\r\nshe appeared to have come into the world to produce. It would still be\r\nessentially a struggle, but its object would now be NOT to receive her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, after Miss Overmore\'s last demonstration, addressed herself\r\nwholly to the little girl, and, drawing from the pocket of her dingy old\r\npelisse a small flat parcel, removed its envelope and wished to know\r\nif THAT looked like a gentleman who wouldn\'t be nice to everybody--let\r\nalone to a person he would be so sure to find so nice. Mrs. Farange, in\r\nthe candour of new-found happiness, had enclosed a "cabinet" photograph\r\nof Sir Claude, and Maisie lost herself in admiration of the fair smooth\r\nface, the regular features, the kind eyes, the amiable air, the general\r\nglossiness and smartness of her prospective stepfather--only vaguely\r\npuzzled to suppose herself now with two fathers at once. Her researches\r\nhad hitherto indicated that to incur a second parent of the same sex you\r\nhad usually to lose the first. "ISN\'T he sympathetic?" asked Mrs. Wix,\r\nwho had clearly, on the strength of his charming portrait, made up her\r\nmind that Sir Claude promised her a future. "You can see, I hope," she\r\nadded with much expression, "that HE\'S a perfect gentleman!" Maisie had\r\nnever before heard the word "sympathetic" applied to anybody\'s face; she\r\nheard it with pleasure and from that moment it agreeably remained with\r\nher. She testified moreover to the force of her own perception in a\r\nsmall soft sigh of response to the pleasant eyes that seemed to seek\r\nher acquaintance, to speak to her directly. "He\'s quite lovely!" she\r\ndeclared to Mrs. Wix. Then eagerly, irrepressibly, as she still held the\r\nphotograph and Sir Claude continued to fraternise, "Oh can\'t I keep it?"\r\nshe broke out. No sooner had she done so than she looked up from it at\r\nMiss Overmore: this was with the sudden instinct of appealing to the\r\nauthority that had long ago impressed on her that she mustn\'t ask for\r\nthings. Miss Overmore, to her surprise, looked distant and rather odd,\r\nhesitating and giving her time to turn again to Mrs. Wix. Then Maisie\r\nsaw that lady\'s long face lengthen; it was stricken and almost scared,\r\nas if her young friend really expected more of her than she had to give.\r\nThe photograph was a possession that, direly denuded, she clung to,\r\nand there was a momentary struggle between her fond clutch of it and\r\nher capability of every sacrifice for her precarious pupil. With the\r\nacuteness of her years, however, Maisie saw that her own avidity would\r\ntriumph, and she held out the picture to Miss Overmore as if she were\r\nquite proud of her mother. "Isn\'t he just lovely?" she demanded while\r\npoor Mrs. Wix hungrily wavered, her straighteners largely covering it\r\nand her pelisse gathered about her with an intensity that strained its\r\nancient seams.\r\n\r\n"It was to ME, darling," the visitor said, "that your mamma so\r\ngenerously sent it; but of course if it would give you particular\r\npleasure--" she faltered, only gasping her surrender.\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore continued extremely remote. "If the photograph\'s your\r\nproperty, my dear, I shall be happy to oblige you by looking at it on\r\nsome future occasion. But you must excuse me if I decline to touch an\r\nobject belonging to Mrs. Wix."\r\n\r\nThat lady had by this time grown very red. "You might as well see him\r\nthis way, miss," she retorted, "as you certainly never will, I believe,\r\nin any other! Keep the pretty picture, by all means, my precious," she\r\nwent on: "Sir Claude will be happy himself, I dare say, to give me one\r\nwith a kind inscription." The pathetic quaver of this brave boast was\r\nnot lost on Maisie, who threw herself so gratefully on the speaker\'s\r\nneck that, when they had concluded their embrace, the public tenderness\r\nof which, she felt, made up for the sacrifice she imposed, their\r\ncompanion had had time to lay a quick hand on Sir Claude and, with a\r\nglance at him or not, whisk him effectually out of sight. Released from\r\nthe child\'s arms Mrs. Wix looked about for the picture; then she fixed\r\nMiss Overmore with a hard dumb stare; and finally, with her eyes on\r\nthe little girl again, achieved the grimmest of smiles. "Well, nothing\r\nmatters, Maisie, because there\'s another thing your mamma wrote about.\r\nShe has made sure of me." Even after her loyal hug Maisie felt a bit of\r\na sneak as she glanced at Miss Overmore for permission to understand\r\nthis. But Mrs. Wix left them in no doubt of what it meant. "She has\r\ndefinitely engaged me--for her return and for yours. Then you\'ll see\r\nfor yourself." Maisie, on the spot, quite believed she should; but\r\nthe prospect was suddenly thrown into confusion by an extraordinary\r\ndemonstration from Miss Overmore.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Wix," said that young lady, "has some undiscoverable reason for\r\nregarding your mother\'s hold on you as strengthened by the fact that\r\nshe\'s about to marry. I wonder then--on that system--what our visitor\r\nwill say to your father\'s."\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore\'s words were directed to her pupil, but her face, lighted\r\nwith an irony that made it prettier even than ever before, was presented\r\nto the dingy figure that had stiffened itself for departure. The\r\nchild\'s discipline had been bewildering--had ranged freely between the\r\nprescription that she was to answer when spoken to and the experience of\r\nlively penalties on obeying that prescription. This time, nevertheless,\r\nshe felt emboldened for risks; above all as something portentous seemed\r\nto have leaped into her sense of the relations of things. She looked at\r\nMiss Overmore much as she had a way of looking at persons who treated\r\nher to "grown up" jokes. "Do you mean papa\'s hold on me--do you mean\r\nHE\'S about to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Papa\'s not about to marry--papa IS married, my dear. Papa was married\r\nthe day before yesterday at Brighton." Miss Overmore glittered more\r\ngaily; meanwhile it came over Maisie, and quite dazzlingly, that her\r\n"smart" governess was a bride. "He\'s my husband, if you please, and I\'m\r\nhis little wife. So NOW we\'ll see who\'s your little mother!" She caught\r\nher pupil to her bosom in a manner that was not to be outdone by the\r\nemissary of her predecessor, and a few moments later, when things had\r\nlurched back into their places, that poor lady, quite defeated of the\r\nlast word, had soundlessly taken flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Wix\'s retreat Miss Overmore appeared to recognise that she\r\nwas not exactly in a position to denounce Ida Farange\'s second union;\r\nbut she drew from a table-drawer the photograph of Sir Claude and,\r\nstanding there before Maisie, studied it at some length.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he beautiful?" the child ingenuously asked.\r\n\r\nHer companion hesitated. "No--he\'s horrid," she, to Maisie\'s surprise,\r\nsharply returned. But she debated another minute, after which she handed\r\nback the picture. It appeared to Maisie herself to exhibit a fresh\r\nattraction, and she was troubled, having never before had occasion to\r\ndiffer from her lovely friend. So she only could ask what, such being\r\nthe case, she should do with it: should she put it quite away--where\r\nit wouldn\'t be there to offend? On this Miss Overmore again cast\r\nabout; after which she said unexpectedly: "Put it on the schoolroom\r\nmantelpiece."\r\n\r\nMaisie felt a fear. "Won\'t papa dislike to see it there?"\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed; but that won\'t matter NOW." Miss Overmore spoke with\r\npeculiar significance and to her pupil\'s mystification.\r\n\r\n"On account of the marriage?" Maisie risked.\r\n\r\nMiss Overmore laughed, and Maisie could see that in spite of the\r\nirritation produced by Mrs. Wix she was in high spirits. "Which marriage\r\ndo you mean?"\r\n\r\nWith the question put to her it suddenly struck the child she didn\'t\r\nknow, so that she felt she looked foolish. So she took refuge in saying:\r\n"Shall YOU be different--" This was a full implication that the bride of\r\nSir Claude would be.\r\n\r\n"As your father\'s wedded wife? Utterly!" Miss Overmore replied. And the\r\ndifference began of course in her being addressed, even by Maisie, from\r\nthat day and by her particular request, as Mrs. Beale. It was there\r\nindeed principally that it ended, for except that the child could\r\nreflect that she should presently have four parents in all, and also\r\nthat at the end of three months the staircase, for a little girl hanging\r\nover banisters, sent up the deepening rustle of more elaborate advances,\r\neverything made the same impression as before. Mrs. Beale had very\r\npretty frocks, but Miss Overmore\'s had been quite as good, and if papa\r\nwas much fonder of his second wife than he had been of his first Maisie\r\nhad foreseen that fondness, had followed its development almost as\r\nclosely as the person more directly involved. There was little indeed in\r\nthe commerce of her companions that her precocious experience couldn\'t\r\nexplain, for if they struck her as after all rather deficient in that\r\nair of the honeymoon of which she had so often heard--in much detail,\r\nfor instance, from Mrs. Wix--it was natural to judge the circumstance\r\nin the light of papa\'s proved disposition to contest the empire of the\r\nmatrimonial tie. His honeymoon, when he came back from Brighton--not\r\non the morrow of Mrs. Wix\'s visit, and not, oddly, till several days\r\nlater--his honeymoon was perhaps perceptibly tinged with the dawn of a\r\nlater stage of wedlock. There were things dislike of which, as the child\r\nknew it, wouldn\'t matter to Mrs. Beale now, and their number increased\r\nso that such a trifle as his hostility to the photograph of Sir Claude\r\nquite dropped out of view. This pleasing object found a conspicuous\r\nplace in the schoolroom, which in truth Mr. Farange seldom entered and\r\nin which silent admiration formed, during the time I speak of, almost\r\nthe sole scholastic exercise of Mrs. Beale\'s pupil.\r\n\r\nMaisie was not long in seeing just what her stepmother had meant by the\r\ndifference she should show in her new character. If she was her father\'s\r\nwife she was not her own governess, and if her presence had had formerly\r\nto be made regular by the theory of a humble function she was now on a\r\nfooting that dispensed with all theories and was inconsistent with all\r\nservitude. That was what she had meant by the drop of the objection to\r\na school; her small companion was no longer required at home as--it was\r\nMrs. Beale\'s own amusing word--a little duenna. The argument against\r\na successor to Miss Overmore remained: it was composed frankly of the\r\nfact, of which Mrs. Beale granted the full absurdity, that she was too\r\nawfully fond of her stepdaughter to bring herself to see her in vulgar\r\nand mercenary hands. The note of this particular danger emboldened\r\nMaisie to put in a word for Mrs. Wix, the modest measure of whose\r\navidity she had taken from the first; but Mrs. Beale disposed afresh and\r\neffectually of a candidate who would be sure to act in some horrible\r\nand insidious way for Ida\'s interest and who moreover was personally\r\nloathsome and as ignorant as a fish. She made also no more of a secret\r\nof the awkward fact that a good school would be hideously expensive, and\r\nof the further circumstance, which seemed to put an end to everything,\r\nthat when it came to the point papa, in spite of his previous clamour,\r\nwas really most nasty about paying. "Would you believe," Mrs. Beale\r\nconfidentially asked of her little charge, "that he says I\'m a worse\r\nexpense than ever, and that a daughter and a wife together are really\r\nmore than he can afford?" It was thus that the splendid school at\r\nBrighton lost itself in the haze of larger questions, though the fear\r\nthat it would provoke Ida to leap into the breach subsided with her\r\nprolonged, her quite shameless non-appearance. Her daughter and her\r\nsuccessor were therefore left to gaze in united but helpless blankness\r\nat all Maisie was not learning.\r\n\r\nThis quantity was so great as to fill the child\'s days with a sense of\r\nintermission to which even French Lisette gave no accent--with finished\r\ngames and unanswered questions and dreaded tests; with the habit, above\r\nall, in her watch for a change, of hanging over banisters when the\r\ndoor-bell sounded. This was the great refuge of her impatience, but\r\nwhat she heard at such times was a clatter of gaiety downstairs; the\r\nimpression of which, from her earliest childhood, had built up in her\r\nthe belief that the grown-up time was the time of real amusement and\r\nabove all of real intimacy. Even Lisette, even Mrs. Wix had never, she\r\nfelt, in spite of hugs and tears, been so intimate with her as so many\r\npersons at present were with Mrs. Beale and as so many others of old had\r\nbeen with Mrs. Farange. The note of hilarity brought people together\r\nstill more than the note of melancholy, which was the one exclusively\r\nsounded, for instance, by poor Mrs. Wix. Maisie in these days preferred\r\nnone the less that domestic revels should be wafted to her from a\r\ndistance: she felt sadly unsupported for facing the inquisition of the\r\ndrawing-room. That was a reason the more for making the most of Susan\r\nAsh, who in her quality of under-housemaid moved at a very different\r\nlevel and who, none the less, was much depended upon out of doors. She\r\nwas a guide to peregrinations that had little in common with those\r\nintensely definite airings that had left with the child a vivid memory\r\nof the regulated mind of Moddle. There had been under Moddle\'s system\r\nno dawdles at shop-windows and no nudges, in Oxford Street, of "I SAY,\r\nlook at \'ER!" There had been an inexorable treatment of crossings and a\r\nserene exemption from the fear that--especially at corners, of which she\r\nwas yet weakly fond--haunted the housemaid, the fear of being, as she\r\nominously said, "spoken to." The dangers of the town equally with its\r\ndiversions added to Maisie\'s sense of being untutored and unclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe situation however, had taken a twist when, on another of her\r\nreturns, at Susan\'s side, extremely tired, from the pursuit of exercise\r\nqualified by much hovering, she encountered another emotion. She on this\r\noccasion learnt at the door that her instant attendance was requested\r\nin the drawing-room. Crossing the threshold in a cloud of shame she\r\ndiscerned through the blur Mrs. Beale seated there with a gentleman who\r\nimmediately drew the pain from her predicament by rising before her as\r\nthe original of the photograph of Sir Claude. She felt the moment she\r\nlooked at him that he was by far the most shining presence that had ever\r\nmade her gape, and her pleasure in seeing him, in knowing that he took\r\nhold of her and kissed her, as quickly throbbed into a strange shy pride\r\nin him, a perception of his making up for her fallen state, for Susan\'s\r\npublic nudges, which quite bruised her, and for all the lessons that, in\r\nthe dead schoolroom, where at times she was almost afraid to stay alone,\r\nshe was bored with not having. It was as if he had told her on the spot\r\nthat he belonged to her, so that she could already show him off and see\r\nthe effect he produced. No, nothing else that was most beautiful ever\r\nbelonging to her could kindle that particular joy--not Mrs. Beale at\r\nthat very moment, not papa when he was gay, nor mamma when she was\r\ndressed, nor Lisette when she was new. The joy almost overflowed\r\nin tears when he laid his hand on her and drew her to him, telling\r\nher, with a smile of which the promise was as bright as that of a\r\nChristmas-tree, that he knew her ever so well by her mother, but had\r\ncome to see her now so that he might know her for himself. She could\r\nsee that his view of this kind of knowledge was to make her come away\r\nwith him, and, further, that it was just what he was there for and had\r\nalready been some time: arranging it with Mrs. Beale and getting on with\r\nthat lady in a manner evidently not at all affected by her having on the\r\narrival of his portrait thought of him so ill. They had grown almost\r\nintimate--or had the air of it--over their discussion; and it was still\r\nfurther conveyed to Maisie that Mrs. Beale had made no secret, and would\r\nmake yet less of one, of all that it cost to let her go. "You seem so\r\ntremendously eager," she said to the child, "that I hope you\'re at least\r\nclear about Sir Claude\'s relation to you. It doesn\'t appear to occur to\r\nhim to give you the necessary reassurance."\r\n\r\nMaisie, a trifle mystified, turned quickly to her new friend. "Why it\'s\r\nof course that you\'re MARRIED to her, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nHer anxious emphasis started them off, as she had learned to call it;\r\nthis was the echo she infallibly and now quite resignedly produced;\r\nmoreover Sir Claude\'s laughter was an indistinguishable part of the\r\nsweetness of his being there. "We\'ve been married, my dear child, three\r\nmonths, and my interest in you is a consequence, don\'t you know? of my\r\ngreat affection for your mother. In coming here it\'s of course for your\r\nmother I\'m acting."\r\n\r\n"Oh I know," Maisie said with all the candour of her competence. "She\r\ncan\'t come herself--except just to the door." Then as she thought\r\nafresh: "Can\'t she come even to the door now?"\r\n\r\n"There you are!" Mrs. Beale exclaimed to Sir Claude. She spoke as if his\r\ndilemma were ludicrous.\r\n\r\nHis kind face, in a hesitation, seemed to recognise it; but he answered\r\nthe child with a frank smile. "No--not very well."\r\n\r\n"Because she has married you?"\r\n\r\nHe promptly accepted this reason. "Well, that has a good deal to do with\r\nit."\r\n\r\nHe was so delightful to talk to that Maisie pursued the subject. "But\r\npapa--HE has married Miss Overmore."\r\n\r\n"Ah you\'ll see that he won\'t come for you at your mother\'s," that lady\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but that won\'t be for a long time," Maisie hastened to respond.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t talk about it now--you\'ve months and months to put in first."\r\nAnd Sir Claude drew her closer.\r\n\r\n"Oh that\'s what makes it so hard to give her up!" Mrs. Beale made this\r\npoint with her arms out to her stepdaughter. Maisie, quitting Sir\r\nClaude, went over to them and, clasped in a still tenderer embrace, felt\r\nentrancingly the extension of the field of happiness. "I\'LL come for\r\nyou," said her stepmother, "if Sir Claude keeps you too long: we must\r\nmake him quite understand that! Don\'t talk to me about her ladyship!"\r\nshe went on to their visitor so familiarly that it was almost as if they\r\nmust have met before. "I know her ladyship as if I had made her. They\'re\r\na pretty pair of parents!" cried Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\nMaisie had so often heard them called so that the remark diverted her\r\nbut an instant from the agreeable wonder of this grand new form of\r\nallusion to her mother; and that, in its turn, presently left her free\r\nto catch at the pleasant possibility, in connexion with herself, of\r\na relation much happier as between Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude than as\r\nbetween mamma and papa. Still the next thing that happened was that her\r\ninterest in such a relation brought to her lips a fresh question.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen papa?" she asked of Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nIt was the signal for their going off again, as her small stoicism had\r\nperfectly taken for granted that it would be. All that Mrs. Beale had\r\nnevertheless to add was the vague apparent sarcasm: "Oh papa!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m assured he\'s not at home," Sir Claude replied to the child; "but if\r\nhe had been I should have hoped for the pleasure of seeing him."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t he mind your coming?" Maisie asked as with need of the knowledge.\r\n\r\n"Oh you bad little girl!" Mrs. Beale humorously protested.\r\n\r\nThe child could see that at this Sir Claude, though still moved to\r\nmirth, coloured a little; but he spoke to her very kindly. "That\'s just\r\nwhat I came to see, you know--whether your father WOULD mind. But Mrs.\r\nBeale appears strongly of the opinion that he won\'t."\r\n\r\nThis lady promptly justified that view to her stepdaughter. "It will be\r\nvery interesting, my dear, you know, to find out what it is to-day that\r\nyour father does mind. I\'m sure _I_ don\'t know!"--and she seemed to\r\nrepeat, though with perceptible resignation, her plaint of a moment\r\nbefore. "Your father, darling, is a very odd person indeed." She turned\r\nwith this, smiling, to Sir Claude. "But perhaps it\'s hardly civil for me\r\nto say that of his not objecting to have YOU in the house. If you knew\r\nsome of the people he does have!"\r\n\r\nMaisie knew them all, and none indeed were to be compared to Sir Claude.\r\nHe laughed back at Mrs. Beale; he looked at such moments quite as Mrs.\r\nWix, in the long stories she told her pupil, always described the lovers\r\nof her distressed beauties--"the perfect gentleman and strikingly\r\nhandsome." He got up, to the child\'s regret, as if he were going. "Oh I\r\ndare say we should be all right!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale once more gathered in her little charge, holding her close\r\nand looking thoughtfully over her head at their visitor. "It\'s so\r\ncharming--for a man of your type--to have wanted her so much!"\r\n\r\n"What do you know about my type?" Sir Claude laughed. "Whatever it may\r\nbe I dare say it deceives you. The truth about me is simply that I\'m the\r\nmost unappreciated of--what do you call the fellows?--\'family-men.\' Yes,\r\nI\'m a family-man; upon my honour I am!"\r\n\r\n"Then why on earth," cried Mrs. Beale, "didn\'t you marry a\r\nfamily-woman?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked at her hard. "YOU know who one marries, I think.\r\nBesides, there ARE no family-women--hanged if there are! None of them\r\nwant any children--hanged if they do!"\r\n\r\nHis account of the matter was most interesting, and Maisie, as if it\r\nwere of bad omen for her, stared at the picture in some dismay. At the\r\nsame time she felt, through encircling arms, her protectress hesitate.\r\n"You do come out with things! But you mean her ladyship doesn\'t want\r\nany--really?"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t hear of them--simply. But she can\'t help the one she HAS got."\r\nAnd with this Sir Claude\'s eyes rested on the little girl in a way that\r\nseemed to her to mask her mother\'s attitude with the consciousness of\r\nhis own. "She must make the best of her, don\'t you see? If only for the\r\nlook of the thing, don\'t you know? one wants one\'s wife to take the\r\nproper line about her child."\r\n\r\n"Oh I know what one wants!" Mrs. Beale cried with a competence that\r\nevidently impressed her interlocutor.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you keep HIM up--and I dare say you\'ve had worry enough--why\r\nshouldn\'t I keep Ida? What\'s sauce for the goose is sauce for the\r\ngander--or the other way round, don\'t you know? I mean to see the thing\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, for a minute, still with her eyes on him as he leaned upon\r\nthe chimneypiece, appeared to turn this over. "You\'re just a wonder of\r\nkindness--that\'s what you are!" she said at last. "A lady\'s expected\r\nto have natural feelings. But YOUR horrible sex--! Isn\'t it a horrible\r\nsex, little love?" she demanded with her cheek upon her stepdaughter\'s.\r\n\r\n"Oh I like gentlemen best," Maisie lucidly replied.\r\n\r\nThe words were taken up merrily. "That\'s a good one for YOU!" Sir Claude\r\nexclaimed to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"No," said that lady: "I\'ve only to remember the women she sees at her\r\nmother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Ah they\'re very nice now," Sir Claude returned.\r\n\r\n"What do you call \'nice\'?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'re all right."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t answer me," said Mrs. Beale; "but I dare say you do take\r\ncare of them. That makes you more of an angel to want this job too." And\r\nshe playfully whacked her smaller companion.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not an angel--I\'m an old grandmother," Sir Claude declared. "I like\r\nbabies--I always did. If we go to smash I shall look for a place as\r\nresponsible nurse."\r\n\r\nMaisie, in her charmed mood, drank in an imputation on her years which\r\nat another moment might have been bitter; but the charm was sensibly\r\ninterrupted by Mrs. Beale\'s screwing her round and gazing fondly into\r\nher eyes, "You\'re willing to leave me, you wretch?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl deliberated; even this consecrated tie had become as a\r\ncord she must suddenly snap. But she snapped it very gently. "Isn\'t it\r\nmy turn for mamma?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a horrible little hypocrite! The less, I think, now said about\r\n\'turns\' the better," Mrs. Beale made answer. "_I_ know whose turn it is.\r\nYou\'ve not such a passion for your mother!"\r\n\r\n"I say, I say: DO look out!" Sir Claude quite amiably protested.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing she hasn\'t heard. But it doesn\'t matter--it hasn\'t\r\nspoiled her. If you knew what it costs me to part with you!" she pursued\r\nto Maisie.\r\n\r\nSir Claude watched her as she charmingly clung to the child. "I\'m so\r\nglad you really care for her. That\'s so much to the good."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale slowly got up, still with her hands on Maisie, but emitting a\r\nsoft exhalation. "Well, if you\'re glad, that may help us; for I assure\r\nyou that I shall never give up any rights in her that I may consider\r\nI\'ve acquired by my own sacrifices. I shall hold very fast to my\r\ninterest in her. What seems to have happened is that she has brought you\r\nand me together."\r\n\r\n"She has brought you and me together," said Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nHis cheerful echo prolonged the happy truth, and Maisie broke out almost\r\nwith enthusiasm: "I\'ve brought you and her together!"\r\n\r\nHer companions of course laughed anew and Mrs. Beale gave her an\r\naffectionate shake. "You little monster--take care what you do! But\r\nthat\'s what she does do," she continued to Sir Claude. "She did it to me\r\nand Beale."\r\n\r\n"Well then," he said to Maisie, "you must try the trick at OUR place."\r\nHe held out his hand to her again. "Will you come now?"\r\n\r\n"Now--just as I am?" She turned with an immense appeal to her\r\nstepmother, taking a leap over the mountain of "mending," the abyss of\r\npacking that had loomed and yawned before her. "Oh MAY I?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale addressed her assent to Sir Claude. "As well so as any other\r\nway. I\'ll send on her things to-morrow." Then she gave a tug to the\r\nchild\'s coat, glancing at her up and down with some ruefulness.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not turned out as I should like--her mother will pull her to\r\npieces. But what\'s one to do--with nothing to do it on? And she\'s better\r\nthan when she came--you can tell her mother that. I\'m sorry to have to\r\nsay it to you--but the poor child was a sight."\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'ll turn her out myself!" the visitor cordially said.\r\n\r\n"I shall like to see how!"--Mrs. Beale appeared much amused. "You must\r\nbring her to show me--we can manage that. Good-bye, little fright!" And\r\nher last word to Sir Claude was that she would keep him up to the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of what she was to make up and the prodigious total it came\r\nto were kept well before Maisie at her mother\'s. These things were the\r\nconstant occupation of Mrs. Wix, who arrived there by the back stairs,\r\nbut in tears of joy, the day after her own arrival. The process of\r\nmaking up, as to which the good lady had an immense deal to say, took,\r\nthrough its successive phases, so long that it heralded a term at least\r\nequal to the child\'s last stretch with her father. This, however, was\r\na fuller and richer time: it bounded along to the tune of Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nconstant insistence on the energy they must both put forth. There was\r\na fine intensity in the way the child agreed with her that under Mrs.\r\nBeale and Susan Ash she had learned nothing whatever; the wildness of\r\nthe rescued castaway was one of the forces that would henceforth make\r\nfor a career of conquest. The year therefore rounded itself as a\r\nreceptacle of retarded knowledge--a cup brimming over with the sense\r\nthat now at least she was learning. Mrs. Wix fed this sense from the\r\nstores of her conversation and with the immense bustle of her reminder\r\nthat they must cull the fleeting hour. They were surrounded with\r\nsubjects they must take at a rush and perpetually getting into the\r\nattitude of triumphant attack. They had certainly no idle hours, and the\r\nchild went to bed each night as tired as from a long day\'s play. This\r\nhad begun from the moment of their reunion, begun with all Mrs. Wix had\r\nto tell her young friend of the reasons of her ladyship\'s extraordinary\r\nbehaviour at the very first.\r\n\r\nIt took the form of her ladyship\'s refusal for three days to see her\r\nlittle girl--three days during which Sir Claude made hasty merry dashes\r\ninto the schoolroom to smooth down the odd situation, to say "She\'ll\r\ncome round, you know; I assure you she\'ll come round," and a little\r\neven to compensate Maisie for the indignity he had caused her to suffer.\r\nThere had never in the child\'s life been, in all ways, such a delightful\r\namount of reparation. It came out by his sociable admission that her\r\nladyship had not known of his visit to her late husband\'s house and\r\nof his having made that person\'s daughter a pretext for striking up\r\nan acquaintance with the dreadful creature installed there. Heaven\r\nknew she wanted her child back and had made every plan of her own for\r\nremoving her; what she couldn\'t for the present at least forgive any\r\none concerned was such an officious underhand way of bringing about the\r\ntransfer. Maisie carried more of the weight of this resentment than even\r\nMrs. Wix\'s confidential ingenuity could lighten for her, especially as\r\nSir Claude himself was not at all ingenious, though indeed on the other\r\nhand he was not at all crushed. He was amused and intermittent and at\r\nmoments most startling; he impressed on his young companion, with a\r\nfrankness that agitated her much more than he seemed to guess, that he\r\ndepended on her not letting her mother, when she should see her, get\r\nanything out of her about anything Mrs. Beale might have said to him. He\r\ncame in and out; he professed, in joke, to take tremendous precautions;\r\nhe showed a positive disposition to romp. He chaffed Mrs. Wix till she\r\nwas purple with the pleasure of it, and reminded Maisie of the reticence\r\nhe expected of her till she set her teeth like an Indian captive. Her\r\nlessons these first days and indeed for long after seemed to be all\r\nabout Sir Claude, and yet she never really mentioned to Mrs. Wix that\r\nshe was prepared, under his inspiring injunction, to be vainly tortured.\r\nThis lady, however, had formulated the position of things with an\r\nacuteness that showed how little she needed to be coached. Her\r\nexplanation of everything that seemed not quite pleasant--and if her own\r\nfooting was perilous it met that danger as well--that her ladyship was\r\npassionately in love. Maisie accepted this hint with infinite awe and\r\npressed upon it much when she was at last summoned into the presence of\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nThere she encountered matters amid which it seemed really to help to\r\ngive her a clue--an almost terrifying strangeness, full, none the less,\r\nafter a little, of reverberations of Ida\'s old fierce and demonstrative\r\nrecoveries of possession. They had been some time in the house together,\r\nand this demonstration came late. Preoccupied, however, as Maisie was\r\nwith the idea of the sentiment Sir Claude had inspired, and familiar,\r\nin addition, by Mrs. Wix\'s anecdotes, with the ravages that in general\r\nsuch a sentiment could produce, she was able to make allowances for her\r\nladyship\'s remarkable appearance, her violent splendour, the wonderful\r\ncolour of her lips and even the hard stare, the stare of some gorgeous\r\nidol described in a story-book, that had come into her eyes in\r\nconsequence of a curious thickening of their already rich circumference.\r\nHer professions and explanations were mixed with eager challenges and\r\nsudden drops, in the midst of which Maisie recognised as a memory\r\nof other years the rattle of her trinkets and the scratch of her\r\nendearments, the odour of her clothes and the jumps of her conversation.\r\nShe had all her old clever way--Mrs. Wix said it was "aristocratic"--of\r\nchanging the subject as she might have slammed the door in your face.\r\nThe principal thing that was different was the tint of her golden hair,\r\nwhich had changed to a coppery red and, with the head it profusely\r\ncovered, struck the child as now lifted still further aloft. This\r\npicturesque parent showed literally a grander stature and a nobler\r\npresence, things which, with some others that might have been\r\nbewildering, were handsomely accounted for by the romantic state of her\r\naffections. It was her affections, Maisie could easily see, that led Ida\r\nto break out into questions as to what had passed at the other house\r\nbetween that horrible woman and Sir Claude; but it was also just here\r\nthat the little girl was able to recall the effect with which in earlier\r\ndays she had practised the pacific art of stupidity. This art again came\r\nto her aid: her mother, in getting rid of her after an interview in\r\nwhich she had achieved a hollowness beyond her years, allowed her fully\r\nto understand she had not grown a bit more amusing.\r\n\r\nShe could bear that; she could bear anything that helped her to feel she\r\nhad done something for Sir Claude. If she hadn\'t told Mrs. Wix how Mrs.\r\nBeale seemed to like him she certainly couldn\'t tell her ladyship. In\r\nthe way the past revived for her there was a queer confusion. It was\r\nbecause mamma hated papa that she used to want to know bad things of\r\nhim; but if at present she wanted to know the same of Sir Claude it was\r\nquite from the opposite motive. She was awestruck at the manner in which\r\na lady might be affected through the passion mentioned by Mrs. Wix; she\r\nheld her breath with the sense of picking her steps among the tremendous\r\nthings of life. What she did, however, now, after the interview with\r\nher mother, impart to Mrs. Wix was that, in spite of her having had her\r\n"good" effect, as she called it--the effect she studied, the effect of\r\nharmless vacancy--her ladyship\'s last words had been that her ladyship\'s\r\nduty by her would be thoroughly done. Over this announcement governess\r\nand pupil looked at each other in silent profundity; but as the weeks\r\nwent by it had no consequences that interfered gravely with the breezy\r\ngallop of making up. Her ladyship\'s duty took at times the form of not\r\nseeing her child for days together, and Maisie led her life in great\r\nprosperity between Mrs. Wix and kind Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix had a new\r\ndress and, as she was the first to proclaim, a better position; so it\r\nall struck Maisie as a crowded brilliant life, with, for the time, Mrs.\r\nBeale and Susan Ash simply "left out" like children not invited to a\r\nChristmas party. Mrs. Wix had a secret terror which, like most of her\r\nsecret feelings, she discussed with her little companion, in great\r\nsolemnity, by the hour: the possibility of her ladyship\'s coming down\r\non them, in her sudden highbred way, with a school. But she had also\r\na balm to this fear in a conviction of the strength of Sir Claude\'s\r\ngrasp of the situation. He was too pleased--didn\'t he constantly say\r\nas much?--with the good impression made, in a wide circle, by Ida\'s\r\nsacrifices; and he came into the schoolroom repeatedly to let them know\r\nhow beautifully he felt everything had gone off and everything would go\r\non.\r\n\r\nHe disappeared at times for days, when his patient friends understood\r\nthat her ladyship would naturally absorb him; but he always came back\r\nwith the drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of\r\nsociety, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he\r\nthought of his home. Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation a sense\r\nthat they almost themselves "went out," he gave her a five-pound note\r\nand the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to\r\nMaisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat\r\n(which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games\r\nin boxes, with printed directions, and a bright red frame for the\r\nprotection of his famous photograph. The games were, as he said, to\r\nwhile away the evening hour; and the evening hour indeed often passed\r\nin futile attempts on Mrs. Wix\'s part to master what "it said" on the\r\npapers. When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always\r\nreplied "Oh immensely!" but they had earnest discussions as to whether\r\nthey hadn\'t better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them.\r\nThis was a course their delicacy shrank from; they couldn\'t have told\r\nexactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let\r\nhim think they had trouble. What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs.\r\nWix, not only the five-pound note and the "not forgetting" her, but\r\nthe perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her\r\nsounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her\r\nwear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion\r\nwhen the poor lady was grander than all of them put together. He shook\r\nhands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than\r\nonce, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the\r\ncrowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm. When he met them in sunny\r\nPiccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically\r\nsuppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism\r\nthat--needless for Mrs. Wix to sound THOSE words--her ladyship, though\r\na blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of. Even to\r\nthe hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation\r\nat such humanities: it brought home to Maisie the way her humble\r\ncompanion had sidled and ducked through life. But it settled the\r\nquestion of the degree to which Sir Claude was a gentleman: he was\r\nmore of one than anybody else in the world--"I don\'t care," Mrs. Wix\r\nrepeatedly remarked, "whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to\r\nwhom you may be contracted in marriage." There were questions that\r\nMaisie never asked; so her governess was spared the embarrassment of\r\ntelling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa. This was not\r\nmoreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between\r\nthem at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going\r\ninto, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it\r\nwas further off than the turn of the page. The answer on the winter\r\nnights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering\r\npamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; and if the\r\ntruth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time\r\nthe little girl\'s chief education.\r\n\r\nIt must also be admitted that he took them far, further perhaps than\r\nwas always warranted by the old-fashioned conscience, the dingy\r\ndecencies, of Maisie\'s simple instructress. There were hours when Mrs.\r\nWix sighingly testified to the scruples she surmounted, seemed to ask\r\nwhat other line one COULD take with a young person whose experience\r\nhad been, as it were, so peculiar. "It isn\'t as if you didn\'t already\r\nknow everything, is it, love?" and "I can\'t make you any worse than\r\nyou ARE, can I, darling?"--these were the terms in which the good lady\r\njustified to herself and her pupil her pleasant conversational ease.\r\nWhat the pupil already knew was indeed rather taken for granted than\r\nexpressed, but it performed the useful function of transcending all\r\ntextbooks and supplanting all studies. If the child couldn\'t be worse\r\nit was a comfort even to herself that she was bad--a comfort offering\r\na broad firm support to the fundamental fact of the present crisis:\r\nthe fact that mamma was fearfully jealous. This was another side\r\nof the circumstance of mamma\'s passion, and the deep couple in the\r\nschoolroom were not long in working round to it. It brought them face\r\nto face with the idea of the inconvenience suffered by any lady who\r\nmarries a gentleman producing on other ladies the charming effect of\r\nSir Claude. That such ladies wouldn\'t be able to help falling in love\r\nwith him was a reflexion naturally irritating to his wife. One day\r\nwhen some accident, some crash of a banged door or some scurry of\r\na scared maid, had rendered this truth particularly vivid, Maisie,\r\nreceptive and profound, suddenly said to her companion: "And you, my\r\ndear, are you in love with him too?" Even her profundity had left\r\na margin for a laugh; so she was a trifle startled by the solemn\r\npromptitude with which Mrs. Wix plumped out: "Over head and ears.\r\nI\'ve NEVER since you ask me, been so far gone."\r\n\r\nThis boldness had none the less no effect of deterrence for her when, a\r\nfew days later--it was because several had elapsed without a visit from\r\nSir Claude--her governess turned the tables. "May I ask you, miss, if\r\nYOU are?" Mrs. Wix brought it out, she could see, with hesitation, but\r\nclearly intending a joke. "Why RATHER!" the child made answer, as if in\r\nsurprise at not having long ago seemed sufficiently to commit herself;\r\non which her friend gave a sigh of apparent satisfaction. It might in\r\nfact have expressed positive relief. Everything was as it should be.\r\n\r\nYet it was not with them, they were very sure, that her ladyship was\r\nfurious, nor because she had forbidden it that there befell at last a\r\nperiod--six months brought it round--when for days together he scarcely\r\ncame near them. He was "off," and Ida was "off," and they were sometimes\r\noff together and sometimes apart; there were seasons when the simple\r\nstudents had the house to themselves, when the very servants seemed\r\nalso to be "off" and dinner became a reckless forage in pantries and\r\nsideboards. Mrs. Wix reminded her disciple on such occasions--hungry\r\nmoments often, when all the support of the reminder was required--that\r\nthe "real life" of their companions, the brilliant society in which it\r\nwas inevitable they should move and the complicated pleasures in which\r\nit was almost presumptuous of the mind to follow them, must offer\r\nfeatures literally not to be imagined without being seen. At one\r\nof these times Maisie found her opening it out that, though the\r\ndifficulties were many, it was Mrs. Beale who had now become the chief.\r\nThen somehow it was brought fully to the child\'s knowledge that her\r\nstepmother had been making attempts to see her, that her mother had\r\ndeeply resented it, that her stepfather had backed her stepmother up,\r\nthat the latter had pretended to be acting as the representative of her\r\nfather, and that her mother took the whole thing, in plain terms, very\r\nhard. The situation was, as Mrs. Wix declared, an extraordinary muddle\r\nto be sure. Her account of it brought back to Maisie the happy vision of\r\nthe way Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale had made acquaintance--an incident to\r\nwhich, with her stepfather, though she had had little to say about it\r\nto Mrs. Wix, she had during the first weeks of her stay at her mother\'s\r\nfound more than one opportunity to revert. As to what had taken place\r\nthe day Sir Claude came for her, she had been vaguely grateful to Mrs.\r\nWix for not attempting, as her mother had attempted, to put her through.\r\nThat was what Sir Claude had called the process when he warned her of\r\nit, and again afterwards when he told her she was an awfully good "chap"\r\nfor having foiled it. Then it was that, well aware Mrs. Beale hadn\'t\r\nin the least really given her up, she had asked him if he remained\r\nin communication with her and if for the time everything must really\r\nbe held to be at an end between her stepmother and herself. This\r\nconversation had occurred in consequence of his one day popping into the\r\nschoolroom and finding Maisie alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was smoking a cigarette and he stood before the fire and looked\r\nat the meagre appointments of the room in a way that made her rather\r\nashamed of them. Then before (on the subject of Mrs. Beale) he let her\r\n"draw" him--that was another of his words; it was astonishing how many\r\nshe gathered in--he remarked that really mamma kept them rather low on\r\nthe question of decorations. Mrs. Wix had put up a Japanese fan and two\r\nrather grim texts; she had wished they were gayer, but they were all she\r\nhappened to have. Without Sir Claude\'s photograph, however, the place\r\nwould have been, as he said, as dull as a cold dinner. He had said\r\nas well that there were all sorts of things they ought to have; yet\r\ngoverness and pupil, it had to be admitted, were still divided between\r\ndiscussing the places where any sort of thing would look best if any\r\nsort of thing should ever come and acknowledging that mutability in the\r\nchild\'s career which was naturally unfavourable to accumulation. She\r\nstayed long enough only to miss things, not half long enough to deserve\r\nthem. The way Sir Claude looked about the schoolroom had made her feel\r\nwith humility as if it were not very different from the shabby attic in\r\nwhich she had visited Susan Ash. Then he had said in abrupt reference to\r\nMrs. Beale: "Do you think she really cares for you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh awfully!" Maisie had replied.\r\n\r\n"But, I mean, does she love you for yourself, as they call it, don\'t you\r\nknow? Is she as fond of you, now, as Mrs. Wix?"\r\n\r\nThe child turned it over. "Oh I\'m not every bit Mrs. Beale has!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude seemed much amused at this. "No; you\'re not every bit she\r\nhas!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed for some moments, but that was an old story to Maisie, who\r\nwas not too much disconcerted to go on: "But she\'ll never give me up."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t either, old boy: so that\'s not so wonderful, and she\'s\r\nnot the only one. But if she\'s so fond of you, why doesn\'t she write to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Oh on account of mamma." This was rudimentary, and she was almost\r\nsurprised at the simplicity of Sir Claude\'s question.\r\n\r\n"I see--that\'s quite right," he answered. "She might get at you--there\r\nare all sorts of ways. But of course there\'s Mrs. Wix."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Mrs. Wix," Maisie lucidly concurred. "Mrs. Wix can\'t abide\r\nher."\r\n\r\nSir Claude seemed interested. "Oh she can\'t abide her? Then what does\r\nshe say about her?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all--because she knows I shouldn\'t like it. Isn\'t it sweet\r\nof her?" the child asked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly; rather nice. Mrs. Beale wouldn\'t hold her tongue for any\r\nsuch thing as that, would she?"\r\n\r\nMaisie remembered how little she had done so; but she desired to protect\r\nMrs. Beale too. The only protection she could think of, however, was the\r\nplea: "Oh at papa\'s, you know, they don\'t mind!"\r\n\r\nAt this Sir Claude only smiled. "No, I dare say not. But here we mind,\r\ndon\'t we?--we take care what we say. I don\'t suppose it\'s a matter on\r\nwhich I ought to prejudice you," he went on; "but I think we must on the\r\nwhole be rather nicer here than at your father\'s. However, I don\'t press\r\nthat; for it\'s the sort of question on which it\'s awfully awkward for\r\nyou to speak. Don\'t worry, at any rate: I assure you I\'ll back you up."\r\nThen after a moment and while he smoked he reverted to Mrs. Beale and\r\nthe child\'s first enquiry. "I\'m afraid we can\'t do much for her just\r\nnow. I haven\'t seen her since that day--upon my word I haven\'t seen\r\nher." The next instant, with a laugh the least bit foolish, the young\r\nman slightly coloured: he must have felt this profession of innocence to\r\nbe excessive as addressed to Maisie. It was inevitable to say to her,\r\nhowever, that of course her mother loathed the lady of the other house.\r\nHe couldn\'t go there again with his wife\'s consent, and he wasn\'t the\r\nman--he begged her to believe, falling once more, in spite of himself,\r\ninto the scruple of showing the child he didn\'t trip--to go there\r\nwithout it. He was liable in talking with her to take the tone of her\r\nbeing also a man of the world. He had gone to Mrs. Beale\'s to fetch\r\naway Maisie, but that was altogether different. Now that she was in\r\nher mother\'s house what pretext had he to give her mother for paying\r\ncalls on her father\'s wife? And of course Mrs. Beale couldn\'t come to\r\nIda\'s--Ida would tear her limb from limb. Maisie, with this talk of\r\npretexts, remembered how much Mrs. Beale had made of her being a good\r\none, and how, for such a function, it was her fate to be either much\r\ndepended on or much missed. Sir Claude moreover recognised on this\r\noccasion that perhaps things would take a turn later on; and he wound\r\nup by saying: "I\'m sure she does sincerely care for you--how can she\r\npossibly help it? She\'s very young and very pretty and very clever: I\r\nthink she\'s charming. But we must walk very straight. If you\'ll help me,\r\nyou know, I\'ll help YOU," he concluded in the pleasant fraternising,\r\nequalising, not a bit patronising way which made the child ready to go\r\nthrough anything for him and the beauty of which, as she dimly felt, was\r\nthat it was so much less a deceitful descent to her years than a real\r\nindifference to them.\r\n\r\nIt gave her moments of secret rapture--moments of believing she might\r\nhelp him indeed. The only mystification in this was the imposing time of\r\nlife that her elders spoke of as youth. For Sir Claude then Mrs. Beale\r\nwas "young," just as for Mrs. Wix Sir Claude was: that was one of the\r\nmerits for which Mrs. Wix most commended him. What therefore was Maisie\r\nherself, and, in another relation to the matter, what therefore was\r\nmamma? It took her some time to puzzle out with the aid of an experiment\r\nor two that it wouldn\'t do to talk about mamma\'s youth. She even went\r\nso far one day, in the presence of that lady\'s thick colour and marked\r\nlines, as to wonder if it would occur to any one but herself to do so.\r\nYet if she wasn\'t young then she was old; and this threw an odd light on\r\nher having a husband of a different generation. Mr. Farange was still\r\nolder--that Maisie perfectly knew; and it brought her in due course\r\nto the perception of how much more, since Mrs. Beale was younger than\r\nSir Claude, papa must be older than Mrs. Beale. Such discoveries were\r\ndisconcerting and even a trifle confounding: these persons, it appeared,\r\nwere not of the age they ought to be. This was somehow particularly\r\nthe case with mamma, and the fact made her reflect with some relief on\r\nher not having gone with Mrs. Wix into the question of Sir Claude\'s\r\nattachment to his wife. She was conscious that in confining their\r\nattention to the state of her ladyship\'s own affections they had been\r\ncontrolled--Mrs. Wix perhaps in especial--by delicacy and even by\r\nembarrassment. The end of her colloquy with her stepfather in the\r\nschoolroom was her saying: "Then if we\'re not to see Mrs. Beale at all\r\nit isn\'t what she seemed to think when you came for me."\r\n\r\nHe looked rather blank. "What did she seem to think?"\r\n\r\n"Why that I\'ve brought you together."\r\n\r\n"She thought that?" Sir Claude asked.\r\n\r\nMaisie was surprised at his already forgetting it. "Just as I had\r\nbrought papa and her. Don\'t you remember she said so?"\r\n\r\nIt came back to Sir Claude in a peal of laughter. "Oh yes--she said so!"\r\n\r\n"And YOU said so," Maisie lucidly pursued.\r\n\r\nHe recovered, with increasing mirth, the whole occasion. "And YOU said\r\nso!" he retorted as if they were playing a game.\r\n\r\n"Then were we all mistaken?"\r\n\r\nHe considered a little. "No, on the whole not. I dare say it\'s just what\r\nyou HAVE done. We ARE together--it\'s really most odd. She\'s thinking of\r\nus--of you and me--though we don\'t meet. And I\'ve no doubt you\'ll find\r\nit will be all right when you go back to her."\r\n\r\n"Am I going back to her?" Maisie brought out with a little gasp which\r\nwas like a sudden clutch of the happy present.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to make Sir Claude grave a moment; it might have made him\r\nfeel the weight of the pledge his action had given. "Oh some day, I\r\nsuppose! We\'ve plenty of time."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve such a tremendous lot to make up," Maisie said with a sense of\r\ngreat boldness.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, and you must make up every hour of it. Oh I\'ll SEE that you\r\ndo!"\r\n\r\nThis was encouraging; and to show cheerfully that she was reassured she\r\nreplied: "That\'s what Mrs. Wix sees too."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Sir Claude; "Mrs. Wix and I are shoulder to shoulder."\r\n\r\nMaisie took in a little this strong image; after which she exclaimed:\r\n"Then I\'ve done it also to you and her--I\'ve brought YOU together!"\r\n\r\n"Blest if you haven\'t!" Sir Claude laughed. "And more, upon my word,\r\nthan any of the lot. Oh you\'ve done for US! Now if you could--as I\r\nsuggested, you know, that day--only manage me and your mother!"\r\n\r\nThe child wondered. "Bring you and HER together?"\r\n\r\n"You see we\'re not together--not a bit. But I oughtn\'t to tell you such\r\nthings; all the more that you won\'t really do it--not you. No, old\r\nchap," the young man continued; "there you\'ll break down. But it won\'t\r\nmatter--we\'ll rub along. The great thing is that you and I are all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"WE\'RE all right!" Maisie echoed devoutly. But the next moment, in the\r\nlight of what he had just said, she asked: "How shall I ever leave you?"\r\nIt was as if she must somehow take care of him.\r\n\r\nHis smile did justice to her anxiety. "Oh well, you needn\'t! It won\'t\r\ncome to that."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that when I do go you\'ll go with me?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude cast about. "Not exactly \'with\' you perhaps; but I shall\r\nnever be far off."\r\n\r\n"But how do you know where mamma may take you?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. "I don\'t, I confess!" Then he had an idea, though\r\nsomething too jocose. "That will be for you to see--that she shan\'t take\r\nme too far."\r\n\r\n"How can I help it?" Maisie enquired in surprise. "Mamma doesn\'t care\r\nfor me," she said very simply. "Not really." Child as she was, her\r\nlittle long history was in the words; and it was as impossible to\r\ncontradict her as if she had been venerable.\r\n\r\nSir Claude\'s silence was an admission of this, and still more the tone\r\nin which he presently replied: "That won\'t prevent her from--some time\r\nor other--leaving me with you."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll live together?" she eagerly demanded.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," said Sir Claude, smiling, "that that will be Mrs. Beale\'s\r\nreal chance."\r\n\r\nHer eagerness just slightly dropped at this; she remembered Mrs. Wix\'s\r\npronouncement that it was all an extraordinary muddle. "To take me\r\nagain? Well, can\'t you come to see me there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I dare say!"\r\n\r\nThough there were parts of childhood Maisie had lost she had all\r\nchildhood\'s preference for the particular promise. "Then you WILL\r\ncome--you\'ll come often, won\'t you?" she insisted; while at the moment\r\nshe spoke the door opened for the return of Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude\r\nhereupon, instead of replying, gave her a look which left her silent\r\nand embarrassed.\r\n\r\nWhen he again found privacy convenient, however--which happened to be\r\nlong in coming--he took up their conversation very much where it had\r\ndropped. "You see, my dear, if I shall be able to go to you at your\r\nfather\'s it yet isn\'t at all the same thing for Mrs. Beale to come to\r\nyou here." Maisie gave a thoughtful assent to this proposition, though\r\nconscious she could scarcely herself say just where the difference would\r\nlie. She felt how much her stepfather saved her, as he said with his\r\nhabitual amusement, the trouble of that. "I shall probably be able to go\r\nto Mrs. Beale\'s without your mother\'s knowing it."\r\n\r\nMaisie stared with a certain thrill at the dramatic element in this.\r\n"And she couldn\'t come here without mamma\'s--" She was unable to\r\narticulate the word for what mamma would do.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, Mrs. Wix would tell of it."\r\n\r\n"But I thought," Maisie objected, "that Mrs. Wix and you--"\r\n\r\n"Are such brothers-in-arms?"--Sir Claude caught her up. "Oh yes, about\r\neverything but Mrs. Beale. And if you should suggest," he went on, "that\r\nwe might somehow or other hide her peeping in from Mrs. Wix--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t suggest THAT!" Maisie in turn cut him short.\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked as if he could indeed quite see why. "No; it would\r\nreally be impossible." There came to her from this glance at what they\r\nmight hide the first small glimpse of something in him that she wouldn\'t\r\nhave expected. There had been times when she had had to make the best\r\nof the impression that she was herself deceitful; yet she had never\r\nconcealed anything bigger than a thought. Of course she now concealed\r\nthis thought of how strange it would be to see HIM hide; and while she\r\nwas so actively engaged he continued: "Besides, you know, I\'m not afraid\r\nof your father."\r\n\r\n"And you are of my mother?"\r\n\r\n"Rather, old man!" Sir Claude returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that her ladyship\'s intermissions were not\r\nqualified by demonstrations of another order--triumphal entries and\r\nbreathless pauses during which she seemed to take of everything in the\r\nroom, from the state of the ceiling to that of her daughter\'s boot-toes,\r\na survey that was rich in intentions. Sometimes she sat down and\r\nsometimes she surged about, but her attitude wore equally in either\r\ncase the grand air of the practical. She found so much to deplore that\r\nshe left a great deal to expect, and bristled so with calculation that\r\nshe seemed to scatter remedies and pledges. Her visits were as good as\r\nan outfit; her manner, as Mrs. Wix once said, as good as a pair of\r\ncurtains; but she was a person addicted to extremes--sometimes barely\r\nspeaking to her child and sometimes pressing this tender shoot to a\r\nbosom cut, as Mrs. Wix had also observed, remarkably low. She was always\r\nin a fearful hurry, and the lower the bosom was cut the more it was to\r\nbe gathered she was wanted elsewhere. She usually broke in alone, but\r\nsometimes Sir Claude was with her, and during all the earlier period\r\nthere was nothing on which these appearances had had so delightful a\r\nbearing as on the way her ladyship was, as Mrs. Wix expressed it, under\r\nthe spell. "But ISN\'T she under it!" Maisie used in thoughtful but\r\nfamiliar reference to exclaim after Sir Claude had swept mamma away in\r\npeals of natural laughter. Not even in the old days of the convulsed\r\nladies had she heard mamma laugh so freely as in these moments of\r\nconjugal surrender, to the gaiety of which even a little girl could see\r\nshe had at last a right--a little girl whose thoughtfulness was now all\r\nhappy selfish meditation on good omens and future fun.\r\n\r\nUnaccompanied, in subsequent hours, and with an effect of changing\r\nto meet a change, Ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and\r\nabrupt--the tone of having, at an immense cost, made over everything to\r\nSir Claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasn\'t right it\r\nwas because Sir Claude was so dreadfully vague. "He has made from the\r\nfirst such a row about you," she said on one occasion to Maisie, "that\r\nI\'ve told him to do for you himself and try how he likes it--see?\r\nI\'ve washed my hands of you; I\'ve made you over to him; and if you\'re\r\ndiscontented it\'s on him, please, you\'ll come down. So don\'t haul poor\r\nME up--I assure you I\'ve worries enough." One of these, visibly, was\r\nthat the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger\r\nof breaking; another was that she was finally forced to make no secret\r\nof her husband\'s unfitness for real responsibilities. The day came\r\nindeed when her breathless auditors learnt from her in bewilderment that\r\nwhat ailed him was that he was, alas, simply not serious. Maisie wept\r\non Mrs. Wix\'s bosom after hearing that Sir Claude was a butterfly;\r\nconsidering moreover that her governess but half-patched it up in coming\r\nout at various moments the next few days with the opinion that it was\r\nproper to his "station" to be careless and free. That had been proper to\r\nevery one\'s station that she had yet encountered save poor Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nown, and the particular merit of Sir Claude had seemed precisely that he\r\nwas different from every one. She talked with him, however, as time went\r\non, very freely about her mother; being with him, in this relation,\r\nwholly without the fear that had kept her silent before her father--the\r\nfear of bearing tales and making bad things worse. He appeared to accept\r\nthe idea that he had taken her over and made her, as he said, his\r\nparticular lark; he quite agreed also that he was an awful fraud and an\r\nidle beast and a sorry dunce. And he never said a word to her against\r\nher mother--he only remained dumb and discouraged in the face of her\r\nladyship\'s own overtopping earnestness. There were occasions when he\r\neven spoke as if he had wrenched his little charge from the arms of a\r\nparent who had fought for her tooth and nail.\r\n\r\nThis was the very moral of a scene that flashed into vividness one day\r\nwhen the four happened to meet without company in the drawing-room and\r\nMaisie found herself clutched to her mother\'s breast and passionately\r\nsobbed and shrieked over, made the subject of a demonstration evidently\r\nsequent to some sharp passage just enacted. The connexion required that\r\nwhile she almost cradled the child in her arms Ida should speak of her\r\nas hideously, as fatally estranged, and should rail at Sir Claude as the\r\ncruel author of the outrage. "He has taken you FROM me," she cried; "he\r\nhas set you AGAINST me, and you\'ve been won away and your horrid little\r\nmind has been poisoned! You\'ve gone over to him, you\'ve given yourself\r\nup to side against me and hate me. You never open your mouth to me--you\r\nknow you don\'t; and you chatter to him like a dozen magpies. Don\'t lie\r\nabout it--I hear you all over the place. You hang about him in a way\r\nthat\'s barely decent--he can do what he likes with you. Well then, let\r\nhim, to his heart\'s content: he has been in such a hurry to take you\r\nthat we\'ll see if it suits him to keep you. I\'m very good to break my\r\nheart about it when you\'ve no more feeling for me than a clammy little\r\nfish!" She suddenly thrust the child away and, as a disgusted admission\r\nof failure, sent her flying across the room into the arms of Mrs. Wix,\r\nwhom at this moment and even in the whirl of her transit Maisie saw,\r\nvery red, exchange a quick queer look with Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the look remained with her, confronting her with such\r\na critical little view of her mother\'s explosion that she felt the less\r\nashamed of herself for incurring the reproach with which she had been\r\ncast off. Her father had once called her a heartless little beast,\r\nand now, though decidedly scared, she was as stiff and cold as if the\r\ndescription had been just. She was not even frightened enough to cry,\r\nwhich would have been a tribute to her mother\'s wrongs: she was only,\r\nmore than anything else, curious about the opinion mutely expressed by\r\ntheir companions. Taking the earliest opportunity to question Mrs. Wix\r\non this subject she elicited the remarkable reply: "Well, my dear, it\'s\r\nher ladyship\'s game, and we must just hold on like grim death."\r\n\r\nMaisie could interpret at her leisure these ominous words. Her\r\nreflexions indeed at this moment thickened apace, and one of them made\r\nher sure that her governess had conversations, private, earnest and not\r\ninfrequent, with her denounced stepfather. She perceived in the light\r\nof a second episode that something beyond her knowledge had taken place\r\nin the house. The things beyond her knowledge--numerous enough in\r\ntruth--had not hitherto, she believed, been the things that had been\r\nnearest to her: she had even had in the past a small smug conviction\r\nthat in the domestic labyrinth she always kept the clue. This time too,\r\nhowever, she at last found out--with the discreet aid, it had to be\r\nconfessed, of Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude\'s own assistance was abruptly taken\r\nfrom her, for his comment on her ladyship\'s game was to start on the\r\nspot, quite alone, for Paris, evidently because he wished to show\r\na spirit when accused of bad behaviour. He might be fond of his\r\nstepdaughter, Maisie felt, without wishing her to be after all thrust on\r\nhim in such a way; his absence therefore, it was clear, was a protest\r\nagainst the thrusting. It was while this absence lasted that our young\r\nlady finally discovered what had happened in the house to be that her\r\nmother was no longer in love.\r\n\r\nThe limit of a passion for Sir Claude had certainly been reached, she\r\njudged, some time before the day on which her ladyship burst suddenly\r\ninto the schoolroom to introduce Mr. Perriam, who, as she announced\r\nfrom the doorway to Maisie, wouldn\'t believe his ears that one had a\r\ngreat hoyden of a daughter. Mr. Perriam was short and massive--Mrs.\r\nWix remarked afterwards that he was "too fat for the pace"; and it\r\nwould have been difficult to say of him whether his head were more\r\nbald or his black moustache more bushy. He seemed also to have\r\nmoustaches over his eyes, which, however, by no means prevented these\r\npolished little globes from rolling round the room as if they had been\r\nbilliard-balls impelled by Ida\'s celebrated stroke. Mr. Perriam wore\r\non the hand that pulled his moustache a diamond of dazzling lustre, in\r\nconsequence of which and of his general weight and mystery our young\r\nlady observed on his departure that if he had only had a turban he\r\nwould have been quite her idea of a heathen Turk.\r\n\r\n"He\'s quite my idea," Mrs. Wix replied, "of a heathen Jew."\r\n\r\n"Well, I mean," said Maisie, "of a person who comes from the East."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where he MUST come from," her governess opined--"he comes from\r\nthe City." In a moment she added as if she knew all about him. "He\'s one\r\nof those people who have lately broken out. He\'ll be immensely rich."\r\n\r\n"On the death of his papa?" the child interestedly enquired.\r\n\r\n"Dear no--nothing hereditary. I mean he has made a mass of money."\r\n\r\n"How much, do you think?" Maisie demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix reflected and sketched it. "Oh many millions."\r\n\r\n"A hundred?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix was not sure of the number, but there were enough of them to\r\nhave seemed to warm up for the time the penury of the schoolroom--to\r\nlinger there as an afterglow of the hot heavy light Mr. Perriam sensibly\r\nshed. This was also, no doubt, on his part, an effect of that enjoyment\r\nof life with which, among her elders, Maisie had been in contact from\r\nher earliest years--the sign of happy maturity, the old familiar note of\r\noverflowing cheer. "How d\'ye do, ma\'am? How d\'ye do, little miss?"--he\r\nlaughed and nodded at the gaping figures. "She has brought me up for a\r\npeep--it\'s true I wouldn\'t take you on trust. She\'s always talking about\r\nyou, but she\'d never produce you; so to-day I challenged her on the\r\nspot. Well, you ain\'t a myth, my dear--I back down on that," the visitor\r\nwent on to Maisie; "nor you either, miss, though you might be, to be\r\nsure!"\r\n\r\n"I bored him with you, darling--I bore every one," Ida said, "and to\r\nprove that you ARE a sweet thing, as well as a fearfully old one, I told\r\nhim he could judge for himself. So now he sees that you\'re a dreadful\r\nbouncing business and that your poor old Mummy\'s at least sixty!"--and\r\nher ladyship smiled at Mr. Perriam with the charm that her daughter had\r\nheard imputed to her at papa\'s by the merry gentlemen who had so often\r\nwished to get from him what they called a "rise." Her manner at that\r\ninstant gave the child a glimpse more vivid than any yet enjoyed of the\r\nattraction that papa, in remarkable language, always denied she could\r\nput forth.\r\n\r\nMr. Perriam, however, clearly recognised it in the humour with which he\r\nmet her. "I never said you ain\'t wonderful--did I ever say it, hey?" and\r\nhe appealed with pleasant confidence to the testimony of the schoolroom,\r\nabout which itself also he evidently felt something might be expected of\r\nhim. "So this is their little place, hey? Charming, charming, charming!"\r\nhe repeated as he vaguely looked round. The interrupted students clung\r\ntogether as if they had been personally exposed; but Ida relieved their\r\nembarrassment by a hunch of her high shoulders. This time the smile she\r\naddressed to Mr. Perriam had a beauty of sudden sadness. "What on earth\r\nis a poor woman to do?"\r\n\r\nThe visitor\'s grimace grew more marked as he continued to look, and\r\nthe conscious little schoolroom felt still more like a cage at a\r\nmenagerie. "Charming, charming, charming!" Mr. Perriam insisted; but\r\nthe parenthesis closed with a prompt click. "There you are!" said her\r\nladyship. "By-bye!" she sharply added. The next minute they were on the\r\nstairs, and Mrs. Wix and her companion, at the open door and looking\r\nmutely at each other, were reached by the sound of the large social\r\ncurrent that carried them back to their life.\r\n\r\nIt was singular perhaps after this that Maisie never put a question\r\nabout Mr. Perriam, and it was still more singular that by the end of a\r\nweek she knew all she didn\'t ask. What she most particularly knew--and\r\nthe information came to her, unsought, straight from Mrs. Wix--was that\r\nSir Claude wouldn\'t at all care for the visits of a millionaire who was\r\nin and out of the upper rooms. How little he would care was proved by\r\nthe fact that under the sense of them Mrs. Wix\'s discretion broke down\r\naltogether; she was capable of a transfer of allegiance, capable, at the\r\naltar of propriety, of a desperate sacrifice of her ladyship. As against\r\nMrs. Beale, she more than once intimated, she had been willing to do\r\nthe best for her, but as against Sir Claude she could do nothing for\r\nher at all. It was extraordinary the number of things that, still\r\nwithout a question, Maisie knew by the time her stepfather came back\r\nfrom Paris--came bringing her a splendid apparatus for painting in\r\nwater-colours and bringing Mrs. Wix, by a lapse of memory that would\r\nhave been droll if it had not been a trifle disconcerting, a second and\r\neven a more elegant umbrella. He had forgotten all about the first,\r\nwith which, buried in as many wrappers as a mummy of the Pharaohs, she\r\nwouldn\'t for the world have done anything so profane as use it. Maisie\r\nknew above all that though she was now, by what she called an informal\r\nunderstanding, on Sir Claude\'s "side," she had yet not uttered a word\r\nto him about Mr. Perriam. That gentleman became therefore a kind of\r\nflourishing public secret, out of the depths of which governess and\r\npupil looked at each other portentously from the time their friend was\r\nrestored to them. He was restored in great abundance, and it was marked\r\nthat, though he appeared to have felt the need to take a stand against\r\nthe risk of being too roughly saddled with the offspring of others, he\r\nat this period exposed himself more than ever before to the presumption\r\nof having created expectations.\r\n\r\nIf it had become now, for that matter, a question of sides, there was at\r\nleast a certain amount of evidence as to where they all were. Maisie of\r\ncourse, in such a delicate position, was on nobody\'s; but Sir Claude had\r\nall the air of being on hers. If therefore Mrs. Wix was on Sir Claude\'s,\r\nher ladyship on Mr. Perriam\'s and Mr. Perriam presumably on her\r\nladyship\'s, this left only Mrs. Beale and Mr. Farange to account for.\r\nMrs. Beale clearly was, like Sir Claude, on Maisie\'s, and papa, it was\r\nto be supposed, on Mrs. Beale\'s. Here indeed was a slight ambiguity,\r\nas papa\'s being on Mrs. Beale\'s didn\'t somehow seem to place him quite\r\non his daughter\'s. It sounded, as this young lady thought it over,\r\nvery much like puss-in-the-corner, and she could only wonder if the\r\ndistribution of parties would lead to a rushing to and fro and a\r\nchanging of places. She was in the presence, she felt, of restless\r\nchange: wasn\'t it restless enough that her mother and her stepfather\r\nshould already be on different sides? That was the great thing that had\r\ndomestically happened. Mrs. Wix, besides, had turned another face: she\r\nhad never been exactly gay, but her gravity was now an attitude as\r\npublic as a posted placard. She seemed to sit in her new dress and brood\r\nover her lost delicacy, which had become almost as doleful a memory as\r\nthat of poor Clara Matilda. "It IS hard for him," she often said to her\r\ncompanion; and it was surprising how competent on this point Maisie\r\nwas conscious of being to agree with her. Hard as it was, however, Sir\r\nClaude had never shown to greater advantage than in the gallant generous\r\nsociable way he carried it off: a way that drew from Mrs. Wix a hundred\r\nexpressions of relief at his not having suffered it to embitter him.\r\nIt threw him more and more at last into the schoolroom, where he\r\nhad plainly begun to recognise that if he was to have the credit of\r\nperverting the innocent child he might also at least have the amusement.\r\nHe never came into the place without telling its occupants that they\r\nwere the nicest people in the house--a remark which always led them to\r\nsay to each other "Mr. Perriam!" as loud as ever compressed lips and\r\nenlarged eyes could make them articulate. He caused Maisie to remember\r\nwhat she had said to Mrs. Beale about his having the nature of a good\r\nnurse, and, rather more than she intended before Mrs. Wix, to bring the\r\nwhole thing out by once remarking to him that none of her good nurses\r\nhad smoked quite so much in the nursery. This had no more effect than\r\nit was meant to on his cigarettes: he was always smoking, but always\r\ndeclaring that it was death to him not to lead a domestic life.\r\n\r\nHe led one after all in the schoolroom, and there were hours of late\r\nevening, when she had gone to bed, that Maisie knew he sat there talking\r\nwith Mrs. Wix of how to meet his difficulties. His consideration for\r\nthis unfortunate woman even in the midst of them continued to show him\r\nas the perfect gentleman and lifted the subject of his courtesy into an\r\nupper air of beatitude in which her very pride had the hush of anxiety.\r\n"He leans on me--he leans on me!" she only announced from time to time;\r\nand she was more surprised than amused when, later on, she accidentally\r\nfound she had given her pupil the impression of a support literally\r\nsupplied by her person. This glimpse of a misconception led her to be\r\nexplicit--to put before the child, with an air of mourning indeed for\r\nsuch a stoop to the common, that what they talked about in the small\r\nhours, as they said, was the question of his taking right hold of life.\r\nThe life she wanted him to take right hold of was the public: "she"\r\nbeing, I hasten to add, in this connexion, not the mistress of his fate,\r\nbut only Mrs. Wix herself. She had phrases about him that were full of\r\neasy understanding, yet full of morality. "He\'s a wonderful nature, but\r\nhe can\'t live like the lilies. He\'s all right, you know, but he must\r\nhave a high interest." She had more than once remarked that his affairs\r\nwere sadly involved, but that they must get him--Maisie and she\r\ntogether apparently--into Parliament. The child took it from her with a\r\nflutter of importance that Parliament was his natural sphere, and she\r\nwas the less prepared to recognise a hindrance as she had never heard\r\nof any affairs whatever that were not involved. She had in the old\r\ndays once been told by Mrs. Beale that her very own were, and with the\r\nrefreshment of knowing that she HAD affairs the information hadn\'t in\r\nthe least overwhelmed her. It was true and perhaps a little alarming\r\nthat she had never heard of any such matters since then. Full of\r\ncharm at any rate was the prospect of some day getting Sir Claude in;\r\nespecially after Mrs. Wix, as the fruit of more midnight colloquies,\r\nonce went so far as to observe that she really believed it was all\r\nthat was wanted to save him. This critic, with these words, struck her\r\ndisciple as cropping up, after the manner of mamma when mamma talked,\r\nquite in a new place. The child stared as at the jump of a kangaroo.\r\n"Save him from what?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix debated, then covered a still greater distance. "Why just from\r\nawful misery."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had not at the moment explained her ominous speech, but the light of\r\nremarkable events soon enabled her companion to read it. It may indeed\r\nbe said that these days brought on a high quickening of Maisie\'s direct\r\nperceptions, of her sense of freedom to make out things for herself.\r\nThis was helped by an emotion intrinsically far from sweet--the increase\r\nof the alarm that had most haunted her meditations. She had no need to\r\nbe told, as on the morrow of the revelation of Sir Claude\'s danger she\r\nwas told by Mrs. Wix, that her mother wanted more and more to know why\r\nthe devil her father didn\'t send for her: she had too long expected\r\nmamma\'s curiosity on this point to express itself sharply. Maisie could\r\nmeet such pressure so far as meeting it was to be in a position to\r\nreply, in words directly inspired, that papa would be hanged before he\'d\r\nagain be saddled with her. She therefore recognised the hour that in\r\ntroubled glimpses she had long foreseen, the hour when--the phrase for\r\nit came back to her from Mrs. Beale--with two fathers, two mothers and\r\ntwo homes, six protections in all, she shouldn\'t know "wherever" to\r\ngo. Such apprehension as she felt on this score was not diminished\r\nby the fact that Mrs. Wix herself was suddenly white with terror: a\r\ncircumstance leading Maisie to the further knowledge that this lady\r\nwas still more scared on her own behalf than on that of her pupil. A\r\ngoverness who had only one frock was not likely to have either two\r\nfathers or two mothers: accordingly if even with these resources Maisie\r\nwas to be in the streets, where in the name of all that was dreadful\r\nwas poor Mrs. Wix to be? She had had, it appeared, a tremendous brush\r\nwith Ida, which had begun and ended with the request that she would be\r\npleased on the spot to "bundle." It had come suddenly but completely,\r\nthis signal of which she had gone in fear. The companions confessed to\r\neach other the dread each had hidden the worst of, but Mrs. Wix was\r\nbetter off than Maisie in having a plan of defence. She declined indeed\r\nto communicate it till it was quite mature; but meanwhile, she hastened\r\nto declare, her feet were firm in the schoolroom. They could only be\r\nloosened by force: she would "leave" for the police perhaps, but she\r\nwouldn\'t leave for mere outrage. That would be to play her ladyship\'s\r\ngame, and it would take another turn of the screw to make her desert her\r\ndarling. Her ladyship had come down with extraordinary violence: it had\r\nbeen one of many symptoms of a situation strained--"between them all,"\r\nas Mrs. Wix said, "but especially between the two"--to the point of God\r\nonly knew what.\r\n\r\nHer description of the crisis made the child blanch. "Between which\r\ntwo?--papa and mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Dear no. I mean between your mother and HIM."\r\n\r\nMaisie, in this, recognised an opportunity to be really deep.\r\n"\'Him\'?--Mr. Perriam?"\r\n\r\nShe fairly brought a blush to the scared face. "Well, my dear, I must\r\nsay what you DON\'T know ain\'t worth mentioning. That it won\'t go on for\r\never with Mr. Perriam--since I MUST meet you--you can suppose? But I\r\nmeant dear Sir Claude."\r\n\r\nMaisie stood corrected rather than abashed. "I see. But it\'s about Mr.\r\nPerriam he\'s angry?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix waited. "He says he\'s not."\r\n\r\n"Not angry? He has told you so?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked at her hard. "Not about HIM!"\r\n\r\n"Then about some one else?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked at her harder. "About some one else."\r\n\r\n"Lord Eric?" the child promptly brought forth.\r\n\r\nAt this, of a sudden, her governess was more agitated. "Oh why, little\r\nunfortunate, should we discuss their dreadful names?"--and she threw\r\nherself for the millionth time on Maisie\'s neck. It took her pupil but\r\na moment to feel that she quivered with insecurity, and, the contact\r\nof her terror aiding, the pair in another instant were sobbing in each\r\nother\'s arms. Then it was that, completely relaxed, demoralised as she\r\nhad never been, Mrs. Wix suffered her wound to bleed and her resentment\r\nto gush. Her great bitterness was that Ida had called her false,\r\ndenounced her hypocrisy and duplicity, reviled her spying and tattling,\r\nher lying and grovelling to Sir Claude. "Me, ME!" the poor woman wailed,\r\n"who\'ve seen what I\'ve seen and gone through everything only to cover\r\nher up and ease her off and smooth her down? If I\'ve been an \'ipocrite\r\nit\'s the other way round: I\'ve pretended, to him and to her, to myself\r\nand to you and to every one, NOT to see! It serves me right to have held\r\nmy tongue before such horrors!"\r\n\r\nWhat horrors they were her companion forbore too closely to enquire,\r\nshowing even signs not a few of an ability to take them for granted.\r\nThat put the couple more than ever, in this troubled sea, in the same\r\nboat, so that with the consciousness of ideas on the part of her fellow\r\nmariner Maisie could sit close and wait. Sir Claude on the morrow came\r\nin to tea, and then the ideas were produced. It was extraordinary how\r\nthe child\'s presence drew out their full strength. The principal one was\r\nstartling, but Maisie appreciated the courage with which her governess\r\nhandled it. It simply consisted of the proposal that whenever and\r\nwherever they should seek refuge Sir Claude should consent to share\r\ntheir asylum. On his protesting with all the warmth in nature against\r\nthis note of secession she asked what else in the world was left to them\r\nif her ladyship should stop supplies.\r\n\r\n"Supplies be hanged, my dear woman!" said their delightful friend.\r\n"Leave supplies to me--I\'ll take care of supplies."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix rose to it. "Well, it\'s exactly because I knew you\'d be so glad\r\nto do so that I put the question before you. There\'s a way to look after\r\nus better than any other. The way\'s just to come along with us."\r\n\r\nIt hung before Maisie, Mrs. Wix\'s way, like a glittering picture, and\r\nshe clasped her hands in ecstasy. "Come along, come along, come along!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked from his stepdaughter back to her governess. "Do you\r\nmean leave this house and take up my abode with you?"\r\n\r\n"It will be the right thing--if you feel as you\'ve told me you feel."\r\nMrs. Wix, sustained and uplifted, was now as clear as a bell.\r\n\r\nSir Claude had the air of trying to recall what he had told her; then\r\nthe light broke that was always breaking to make his face more pleasant.\r\n"It\'s your happy thought that I shall take a house for you?"\r\n\r\n"For the wretched homeless child. Any roof--over OUR heads--will do for\r\nus; but of course for you it will have to be something really nice."\r\n\r\nSir Claude\'s eyes reverted to Maisie, rather hard, as she thought; and\r\nthere was a shade in his very smile that seemed to show her--though she\r\nalso felt it didn\'t show Mrs. Wix--that the accommodation prescribed\r\nmust loom to him pretty large. The next moment, however, he laughed\r\ngaily enough. "My dear lady, you exaggerate tremendously MY poor little\r\nneeds." Mrs. Wix had once mentioned to her young friend that when Sir\r\nClaude called her his dear lady he could do anything with her; and\r\nMaisie felt a certain anxiety to see what he would do now. Well, he only\r\naddressed her a remark of which the child herself was aware of feeling\r\nthe force. "Your plan appeals to me immensely; but of course--don\'t you\r\nsee--I shall have to consider the position I put myself in by leaving my\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll also have to remember," Mrs. Wix replied, "that if you don\'t\r\nlook out your wife won\'t give you time to consider. Her ladyship will\r\nleave YOU."\r\n\r\n"Ah my good friend, I do look out!" the young man returned while Maisie\r\nhelped herself afresh to bread and butter. "Of course if that happens I\r\nshall have somehow to turn round; but I hope with all my heart it won\'t.\r\nI beg your pardon," he continued to his stepdaughter, "for appearing to\r\ndiscuss that sort of possibility under your sharp little nose. But the\r\nfact is I FORGET half the time that Ida\'s your sainted mother."\r\n\r\n"So do I!" said Maisie, her mouth full of bread and butter and to put\r\nhim the more in the right.\r\n\r\nHer protectress, at this, was upon her again. "The little desolate\r\nprecious pet!" For the rest of the conversation she was enclosed in Mrs.\r\nWix\'s arms, and as they sat there interlocked Sir Claude, before them\r\nwith his tea-cup, looked down at them in deepening thought. Shrink\r\ntogether as they might they couldn\'t help, Maisie felt, being a very\r\nlarge lumpish image of what Mrs. Wix required of his slim fineness.\r\nShe knew moreover that this lady didn\'t make it better by adding in a\r\nmoment: "Of course we shouldn\'t dream of a whole house. Any sort of\r\nlittle lodging, however humble, would be only too blest."\r\n\r\n"But it would have to be something that would hold us all," said Sir\r\nClaude.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," Mrs. Wix concurred; "the whole point\'s our being together.\r\nWhile you\'re waiting, before you act, for her ladyship to take some\r\nstep, our position here will come to an impossible pass. You don\'t\r\nknow what I went through with her for you yesterday--and for our poor\r\ndarling; but it\'s not a thing I can promise you often to face again. She\r\ncast me out in horrible language--she has instructed the servants not to\r\nwait on me."\r\n\r\n"Oh the poor servants are all right!" Sir Claude eagerly cried.\r\n\r\n"They\'re certainly better than their mistress. It\'s too dreadful that I\r\nshould sit here and say of your wife, Sir Claude, and of Maisie\'s own\r\nmother, that she\'s lower than a domestic; but my being betrayed into\r\nsuch remarks is just a reason the more for our getting away. I shall\r\nstay till I\'m taken by the shoulders, but that may happen any day. What\r\nalso may perfectly happen, you must permit me to repeat, is that she\'ll\r\ngo off to get rid of us."\r\n\r\n"Oh if she\'ll only do that!" Sir Claude laughed. "That would be the very\r\nmaking of us!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say it--don\'t say it!" Mrs. Wix pleaded. "Don\'t speak of anything\r\nso fatal. You know what I mean. We must all cling to the right. You\r\nmustn\'t be bad."\r\n\r\nSir Claude set down his tea-cup; he had become more grave and he\r\npensively wiped his moustache. "Won\'t all the world say I\'m awful if I\r\nleave the house before--before she has bolted? They\'ll say it was my\r\ndoing so that made her bolt."\r\n\r\nMaisie could grasp the force of this reasoning, but it offered no check\r\nto Mrs. Wix. "Why need you mind that--if you\'ve done it for so high a\r\nmotive? Think of the beauty of it," the good lady pressed.\r\n\r\n"Of bolting with YOU?" Sir Claude ejaculated.\r\n\r\nShe faintly smiled--she even faintly coloured. "So far from doing you\r\nharm it will do you the highest good. Sir Claude, if you\'ll listen to\r\nme, it will save you."\r\n\r\n"Save me from what?"\r\n\r\nMaisie, at this question, waited with renewed suspense for an answer\r\nthat would bring the thing to some finer point than their companion\r\nhad brought it to before. But there was on the contrary only more\r\nmystification in Mrs. Wix\'s reply. "Ah from you know what!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean from some other woman!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--from a real bad one."\r\n\r\nSir Claude at least, the child could see, was not mystified; so little\r\nindeed that a smile of intelligence broke afresh in his eyes. He turned\r\nthem in vague discomfort to Maisie, and then something in the way she\r\nmet them caused him to chuck her playfully under the chin. It was not\r\ntill after this that he good-naturedly met Mrs. Wix. "You think me much\r\nworse than I am."\r\n\r\n"If that were true," she returned, "I wouldn\'t appeal to you. I do, Sir\r\nClaude, in the name of all that\'s good in you--and oh so earnestly! We\r\ncan help each other. What you\'ll do for our young friend here I needn\'t\r\nsay. That isn\'t even what I want to speak of now. What I want to speak\r\nof is what you\'ll GET--don\'t you see?--from such an opportunity to take\r\nhold. Take hold of US--take hold of HER. Make her your duty--make her\r\nyour life: she\'ll repay you a thousand-fold!"\r\n\r\nIt was to Mrs. Wix, during this appeal, that Maisie\'s contemplation\r\ntransferred itself: partly because, though her heart was in her throat\r\nfor trepidation, her delicacy deterred her from appearing herself to\r\npress the question; partly from the coercion of seeing Mrs. Wix come out\r\nas Mrs. Wix had never come before--not even on the day of her call at\r\nMrs. Beale\'s with the news of mamma\'s marriage. On that day Mrs. Beale\r\nhad surpassed her in dignity, but nobody could have surpassed her now.\r\nThere was in fact at this moment a fascination for her pupil in the hint\r\nshe seemed to give that she had still more of that surprise behind. So\r\nthe sharpened sense of spectatorship was the child\'s main support, the\r\nlong habit, from the first, of seeing herself in discussion and finding\r\nin the fury of it--she had had a glimpse of the game of football--a sort\r\nof compensation for the doom of a peculiar passivity. It gave her often\r\nan odd air of being present at her history in as separate a manner as if\r\nshe could only get at experience by flattening her nose against a pane\r\nof glass. Such she felt to be the application of her nose while she\r\nwaited for the effect of Mrs. Wix\'s eloquence. Sir Claude, however,\r\ndidn\'t keep her long in a position so ungraceful: he sat down and opened\r\nhis arms to her as he had done the day he came for her at her father\'s,\r\nand while he held her there, looking at her kindly, but as if their\r\ncompanion had brought the blood a good deal to his face, he said:\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Wix is magnificent, but she\'s rather too grand about it.\r\nI mean the situation isn\'t after all quite so desperate or quite so\r\nsimple. But I give you my word before her, and I give it to her before\r\nyou, that I\'ll never, never, forsake you. Do you hear that, old fellow,\r\nand do you take it in? I\'ll stick to you through everything."\r\n\r\nMaisie did take it in--took it with a long tremor of all her little\r\nbeing; and then as, to emphasise it, he drew her closer she buried her\r\nhead on his shoulder and cried without sound and without pain. While she\r\nwas so engaged she became aware that his own breast was agitated, and\r\ngathered from it with rapture that his tears were as silently flowing.\r\nPresently she heard a loud sob from Mrs. Wix--Mrs. Wix was the only one\r\nwho made a noise.\r\n\r\nShe was to have made, for some time, none other but this, though\r\nwithin a few days, in conversation with her pupil, she described her\r\nintercourse with Ida as little better than the state of being battered.\r\nThere was as yet nevertheless no attempt to eject her by force, and she\r\nrecognised that Sir Claude, taking such a stand as never before, had\r\nintervened with passion and with success. As Maisie remembered--and\r\nremembered wholly without disdain--that he had told her he was afraid of\r\nher ladyship, the little girl took this act of resolution as a proof of\r\nwhat, in the spirit of the engagement sealed by all their tears, he was\r\nreally prepared to do. Mrs. Wix spoke to her of the pecuniary sacrifice\r\nby which she herself purchased the scant security she enjoyed and which,\r\nif it was a defence against the hand of violence, yet left her exposed\r\nto incredible rudeness. Didn\'t her ladyship find every hour of the\r\nday some artful means to humiliate and trample upon her? There was a\r\nquarter\'s salary owing her--a great name, even Maisie could suspect,\r\nfor a small matter; she should never see it as long as she lived, but\r\nkeeping quiet about it put her ladyship, thank heaven, a little in one\'s\r\npower. Now that he was doing so much else she could never have the\r\ngrossness to apply for it to Sir Claude. He had sent home for schoolroom\r\nconsumption a huge frosted cake, a wonderful delectable mountain with\r\ngeological strata of jam, which might, with economy, see them through\r\nmany days of their siege; but it was none the less known to Mrs. Wix\r\nthat his affairs were more and more involved, and her fellow partaker\r\nlooked back tenderly, in the light of these involutions, at the\r\nexpression of face with which he had greeted the proposal that he should\r\nset up another establishment. Maisie felt that if their maintenance\r\nshould hang by a thread they must still demean themselves with the\r\nhighest delicacy. What he was doing was simply acting without delay, so\r\nfar as his embarrassments permitted, on the inspiration of his elder\r\nfriend. There was at this season a wonderful month of May--as soft as a\r\ndrop of the wind in a gale that had kept one awake--when he took out his\r\nstepdaughter with a fresh alacrity and they rambled the great town in\r\nsearch, as Mrs. Wix called it, of combined amusement and instruction.\r\n\r\nThey rode on the top of \'buses; they visited outlying parks; they went\r\nto cricket-matches where Maisie fell asleep; they tried a hundred places\r\nfor the best one to have tea. This was his direct way of rising to Mrs.\r\nWix\'s grand lesson--of making his little accepted charge his duty and\r\nhis life. They dropped, under incontrollable impulses, into shops that\r\nthey agreed were too big, to look at things that they agreed were too\r\nsmall, and it was during these hours that Mrs. Wix, alone at home, but\r\na subject of regretful reference as they pulled off their gloves for\r\nrefreshment, subsequently described herself as least sheltered from the\r\nblows her ladyship had achieved such ingenuity in dealing. She again\r\nand again repeated that she wouldn\'t so much have minded having her\r\n"attainments" held up to scorn and her knowledge of every subject\r\ndenied, hadn\'t she been branded as "low" in character and tone. There\r\nwas by this time no pretence on the part of any one of denying it to be\r\nfortunate that her ladyship habitually left London every Saturday and\r\nwas more and more disposed to a return late in the week. It was almost\r\nequally public that she regarded as a preposterous "pose," and indeed as\r\na direct insult to herself, her husband\'s attitude of staying behind to\r\nlook after a child for whom the most elaborate provision had been made.\r\nIf there was a type Ida despised, Sir Claude communicated to Maisie, it\r\nwas the man who pottered about town of a Sunday; and he also mentioned\r\nhow often she had declared to him that if he had a grain of spirit\r\nhe would be ashamed to accept a menial position about Mr. Farange\'s\r\ndaughter. It was her ladyship\'s contention that he was in craven fear\r\nof his predecessor--otherwise he would recognise it as an obligation of\r\nplain decency to protect his wife against the outrage of that person\'s\r\nbarefaced attempt to swindle her. The swindle was that Mr. Farange\r\nput upon her the whole intolerable burden; "and even when I pay for\r\nyou myself," Sir Claude averred to his young friend, "she accuses me\r\nthe more of truckling and grovelling." It was Mrs. Wix\'s conviction,\r\nthey both knew, arrived at on independent grounds, that Ida\'s weekly\r\nexcursions were feelers for a more considerable absence. If she came\r\nback later each week the week would be sure to arrive when she wouldn\'t\r\ncome back at all. This appearance had of course much to do with Mrs.\r\nWix\'s actual valour. Could they but hold out long enough the snug little\r\nhome with Sir Claude would find itself informally established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might moreover have been taken to be the sense of a remark made by\r\nher stepfather as--one rainy day when the streets were all splash and\r\ntwo umbrellas unsociable and the wanderers had sought shelter in the\r\nNational Gallery--Maisie sat beside him staring rather sightlessly at a\r\nroomful of pictures which he had mystified her much by speaking of with\r\na bored sigh as a "silly superstition." They represented, with patches\r\nof gold and cataracts of purple, with stiff saints and angular angels,\r\nwith ugly Madonnas and uglier babies, strange prayers and prostrations;\r\nso that she at first took his words for a protest against devotional\r\nidolatry--all the more that he had of late often come with her and\r\nwith Mrs. Wix to morning church, a place of worship of Mrs. Wix\'s own\r\nchoosing, where there was nothing of that sort; no haloes on heads,\r\nbut only, during long sermons, beguiling backs of bonnets, and where,\r\nas her governess always afterwards observed, he gave the most earnest\r\nattention. It presently appeared, however, that his reference was merely\r\nto the affectation of admiring such ridiculous works--an admonition that\r\nshe received from him as submissively as she received everything. What\r\nturn it gave to their talk needn\'t here be recorded: the transition to\r\nthe colourless schoolroom and lonely Mrs. Wix was doubtless an effect of\r\nrelaxed interest in what was before them. Maisie expressed in her own\r\nway the truth that she never went home nowadays without expecting to\r\nfind the temple of her studies empty and the poor priestess cast out.\r\nThis conveyed a full appreciation of her peril, and it was in rejoinder\r\nthat Sir Claude uttered, acknowledging the source of that peril, the\r\nreassurance at which I have glanced. "Don\'t be afraid, my dear: I\'ve\r\nsquared her." It required indeed a supplement when he saw that it left\r\nthe child momentarily blank. "I mean that your mother lets me do what I\r\nwant so long as I let her do what SHE wants."\r\n\r\n"So you ARE doing what you want?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\n"Rather, Miss Farange!"\r\n\r\nMiss Farange turned it over. "And she\'s doing the same?"\r\n\r\n"Up to the hilt!"\r\n\r\nAgain she considered. "Then, please, what may it be?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t tell you for the whole world."\r\n\r\nShe gazed at a gaunt Madonna; after which she broke into a slow smile.\r\n"Well, I don\'t care, so long as you do let her."\r\n\r\n"Oh you monster!"--and Sir Claude\'s gay vehemence brought him to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAnother day, in another place--a place in Baker Street where at a hungry\r\nhour she had sat down with him to tea and buns--he brought out a question\r\ndisconnected from previous talk. "I say, you know, what do you suppose\r\nyour father WOULD do?"\r\n\r\nMaisie hadn\'t long to cast about or to question his pleasant eyes. "If\r\nyou were really to go with us? He\'d make a great complaint."\r\n\r\nHe seemed amused at the term she employed. "Oh I shouldn\'t mind a\r\n\'complaint\'!"\r\n\r\n"He\'d talk to every one about it," said Maisie.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shouldn\'t mind that either."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," the child hastened to respond. "You\'ve told me you\'re\r\nnot afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"The question is are you?" said Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nMaisie candidly considered; then she spoke resolutely. "No, not of\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"But of somebody else?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, of lots of people."\r\n\r\n"Of your mother first and foremost of course."\r\n\r\n"Dear, yes; more of mamma than of--than of--"\r\n\r\n"Than of what?" Sir Claude asked as she hesitated for a comparison.\r\n\r\nShe thought over all objects of dread. "Than of a wild elephant!" she at\r\nlast declared. "And you are too," she reminded him as he laughed.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I am too."\r\n\r\nAgain she meditated. "Why then did you marry her?"\r\n\r\n"Just because I WAS afraid."\r\n\r\n"Even when she loved you?"\r\n\r\n"That made her the more alarming."\r\n\r\nFor Maisie herself, though her companion seemed to find it droll, this\r\nopened up depths of gravity. "More alarming than she is now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, in a different way. Fear, unfortunately, is a very big thing, and\r\nthere\'s a great variety of kinds."\r\n\r\nShe took this in with complete intelligence. "Then I think I\'ve got them\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"You?" her friend cried. "Nonsense! You\'re thoroughly \'game.\'"\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully afraid of Mrs. Beale," Maisie objected.\r\n\r\nHe raised his smooth brows. "That charming woman?"\r\n\r\n"Well," she answered, "you can\'t understand it because you\'re not in the\r\nsame state."\r\n\r\nShe had been going on with a luminous "But" when, across the table, he\r\nlaid his hand on her arm. "I CAN understand it," he confessed. "I AM in\r\nthe same state."\r\n\r\n"Oh but she likes you so!" Maisie promptly pleaded.\r\n\r\nSir Claude literally coloured. "That has something to do with it."\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered again. "Being liked with being afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, when it amounts to adoration."\r\n\r\n"Then why aren\'t you afraid of ME?"\r\n\r\n"Because with you it amounts to that?" He had kept his hand on her arm.\r\n"Well, what prevents is simply that you\'re the gentlest spirit on earth.\r\nBesides--" he pursued; but he came to a pause.\r\n\r\n"Besides--?"\r\n\r\n"I SHOULD be in fear if you were older--there! See--you already make me\r\ntalk nonsense," the young man added. "The question\'s about your father.\r\nIs he likewise afraid of Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. And yet he loves her," Maisie mused.\r\n\r\n"Oh no--he doesn\'t; not a bit!" After which, as his companion stared,\r\nSir Claude apparently felt that he must make this oddity fit with her\r\nrecollections. "There\'s nothing of that sort NOW."\r\n\r\nBut Maisie only stared the more. "They\'ve changed?"\r\n\r\n"Like your mother and me."\r\n\r\nShe wondered how he knew. "Then you\'ve seen Mrs. Beale again?"\r\n\r\nHe demurred. "Oh no. She has written to me," he presently subjoined.\r\n"SHE\'S not afraid of your father either. No one at all is--really."\r\nThen he went on while Maisie\'s little mind, with its filial spring\r\ntoo relaxed from of old for a pang at this want of parental majesty,\r\nspeculated on the vague relation between Mrs. Beale\'s courage and the\r\nquestion, for Mrs. Wix and herself, of a neat lodging with their friend.\r\n"She wouldn\'t care a bit if Mr. Farange should make a row."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean about you and me and Mrs. Wix? Why should she care? It\r\nwouldn\'t hurt HER."\r\n\r\nSir Claude, with his legs out and his hand diving into his\r\ntrousers-pocket, threw back his head with a laugh just perceptibly\r\ntempered, as she thought, by a sigh. "My dear stepchild, you\'re\r\ndelightful! Look here, we must pay. You\'ve had five buns?"\r\n\r\n"How CAN you?" Maisie demanded, crimson under the eye of the young woman\r\nwho had stepped to their board. "I\'ve had three."\r\n\r\nShortly after this Mrs. Wix looked so ill that it was to be feared her\r\nladyship had treated her to some unexampled passage. Maisie asked if\r\nanything worse than usual had occurred; whereupon the poor woman brought\r\nout with infinite gloom: "He has been seeing Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\n"Sir Claude?" The child remembered what he had said. "Oh no--not SEEING\r\nher!"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon. I absolutely know it." Mrs. Wix was as positive as\r\nshe was dismal.\r\n\r\nMaisie nevertheless ventured to challenge her. "And how, please, do you\r\nknow it?"\r\n\r\nShe faltered a moment. "From herself. I\'ve been to see her."\r\n\r\nThen on Maisie\'s visible surprise: "I went yesterday while you were out\r\nwith him. He has seen her repeatedly."\r\n\r\nIt was not wholly clear to Maisie why Mrs. Wix should be prostrate at\r\nthis discovery; but her general consciousness of the way things could be\r\nboth perpetrated and resented always eased off for her the strain of the\r\nparticular mystery. "There may be some mistake. He says he hasn\'t."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix turned paler, as if this were a still deeper ground for alarm.\r\n"He says so?--he denies that he has seen her?"\r\n\r\n"He told me so three days ago. Perhaps she\'s mistaken," Maisie\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean perhaps she lies? She lies whenever it suits her, I\'m very\r\nsure. But I know when people lie--and that\'s what I\'ve loved in you,\r\nthat YOU never do. Mrs. Beale didn\'t yesterday at any rate. He HAS seen\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMaisie was silent a little. "He says not," she then repeated.\r\n"Perhaps--perhaps--" Once more she paused.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean perhaps HE lies?"\r\n\r\n"Gracious goodness, no!" Maisie shouted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix\'s bitterness, however, again overflowed. "He does, he does,"\r\nshe cried, "and it\'s that that\'s just the worst of it! They\'ll take\r\nyou, they\'ll take you, and what in the world will then become of me?"\r\nShe threw herself afresh upon her pupil and wept over her with the\r\ninevitable effect of causing the child\'s own tears to flow. But Maisie\r\ncouldn\'t have told you if she had been crying at the image of their\r\nseparation or at that of Sir Claude\'s untruth. As regards this deviation\r\nit was agreed between them that they were not in a position to bring it\r\nhome to him. Mrs. Wix was in dread of doing anything to make him, as\r\nshe said, "worse"; and Maisie was sufficiently initiated to be able to\r\nreflect that in speaking to her as he had done he had only wished to be\r\ntender of Mrs. Beale. It fell in with all her inclinations to think of\r\nhim as tender, and she forbore to let him know that the two ladies had,\r\nas SHE would never do, betrayed him.\r\n\r\nShe had not long to keep her secret, for the next day, when she went\r\nout with him, he suddenly said in reference to some errand he had first\r\nproposed: "No, we won\'t do that--we\'ll do something else." On this, a\r\nfew steps from the door, he stopped a hansom and helped her in; then\r\nfollowing her he gave the driver over the top an address that she lost.\r\nWhen he was seated beside her she asked him where they were going; to\r\nwhich he replied "My dear child, you\'ll see." She saw while she watched\r\nand wondered that they took the direction of the Regent\'s Park; but\r\nshe didn\'t know why he should make a mystery of that, and it was not\r\ntill they passed under a pretty arch and drew up at a white house\r\nin a terrace from which the view, she thought, must be lovely that,\r\nmystified, she clutched him and broke out: "I shall see papa?"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at her with a kind smile. "No, probably not. I haven\'t\r\nbrought you for that."\r\n\r\n"Then whose house is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s your father\'s. They\'ve moved here."\r\n\r\nShe looked about: she had known Mr. Farange in four or five houses, and\r\nthere was nothing astonishing in this except that it was the nicest\r\nplace yet. "But I shall see Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s to see her that I brought you."\r\n\r\nShe stared, very white, and, with her hand on his arm, though they had\r\nstopped, kept him sitting in the cab. "To leave me, do you mean?"\r\n\r\nHe could scarce bring it out. "It\'s not for me to say if you CAN stay.\r\nWe must look into it."\r\n\r\n"But if I do I shall see papa?"\r\n\r\n"Oh some time or other, no doubt." Then Sir Claude went on: "Have you\r\nreally so very great a dread of that?"\r\n\r\nMaisie glanced away over the apron of the cab--gazed a minute at the\r\ngreen expanse of the Regent\'s Park and, at this moment colouring to the\r\nroots of her hair, felt the full, hot rush of an emotion more mature\r\nthan any she had yet known. It consisted of an odd unexpected shame at\r\nplacing in an inferior light, to so perfect a gentleman and so charming\r\na person as Sir Claude, so very near a relative as Mr. Farange. She\r\nremembered, however, her friend\'s telling her that no one was seriously\r\nafraid of her father, and she turned round with a small toss of her\r\nhead. "Oh I dare say I can manage him!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude smiled, but she noted that the violence with which she had\r\njust changed colour had brought into his own face a slight compunctious\r\nand embarrassed flush. It was as if he had caught his first glimpse of\r\nher sense of responsibility. Neither of them made a movement to get out,\r\nand after an instant he said to her: "Look here, if you say so we won\'t\r\nafter all go in."\r\n\r\n"Ah but I want to see Mrs. Beale!" the child gently wailed.\r\n\r\n"But what if she does decide to take you? Then, you know, you\'ll have to\r\nremain."\r\n\r\nMaisie turned it over. "Straight on--and give you up?"\r\n\r\n"Well--I don\'t quite know about giving me up."\r\n\r\n"I mean as I gave up Mrs. Beale when I last went to mamma\'s. I couldn\'t\r\ndo without you here for anything like so long a time as that." It struck\r\nher as a hundred years since she had seen Mrs. Beale, who was on the\r\nother side of the door they were so near and whom she yet had not taken\r\nthe jump to clasp in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh I dare say you\'ll see more of me than you\'ve seen of Mrs. Beale.\r\nIt isn\'t in ME to be so beautifully discreet," Sir Claude said. "But\r\nall the same," he continued, "I leave the thing, now that we\'re here,\r\nabsolutely WITH you. You must settle it. We\'ll only go in if you say so.\r\nIf you don\'t say so we\'ll turn right round and drive away."\r\n\r\n"So in that case Mrs. Beale won\'t take me?"\r\n\r\n"Well--not by any act of ours."\r\n\r\n"And I shall be able to go on with mamma?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh I don\'t say that!"\r\n\r\nShe considered. "But I thought you said you had squared her?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude poked his stick at the splashboard of the cab. "Not, my dear\r\nchild, to the point she now requires."\r\n\r\n"Then if she turns me out and I don\'t come here--"\r\n\r\nSir Claude promptly took her up. "What do I offer you, you naturally\r\nenquire? My poor chick, that\'s just what I ask myself. I don\'t see it,\r\nI confess, quite as straight as Mrs. Wix."\r\n\r\nHis companion gazed a moment at what Mrs. Wix saw. "You mean WE can\'t\r\nmake a little family?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s very base of me, no doubt, but I can\'t wholly chuck your mother."\r\n\r\nMaisie, at this, emitted a low but lengthened sigh, a slight sound of\r\nreluctant assent which would certainly have been amusing to an auditor.\r\n"Then there isn\'t anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I vow I don\'t quite see what there is."\r\n\r\nMaisie waited; her silence seemed to signify that she too had no\r\nalternative to suggest. But she made another appeal. "If I come here\r\nyou\'ll come to see me?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t lose sight of you."\r\n\r\n"But how often will you come?" As he hung fire she pressed him. "Often\r\nand often?"\r\n\r\nStill he faltered. "My dear old woman--" he began. Then he paused again,\r\ngoing on the next moment with a change of tone. "You\'re too funny! Yes\r\nthen," he said; "often and often."\r\n\r\n"All right!" Maisie jumped out. Mrs. Beale was at home, but not in the\r\ndrawing-room, and when the butler had gone for her the child suddenly\r\nbroke out: "But when I\'m here what will Mrs. Wix do?"\r\n\r\n"Ah you should have thought of that sooner!" said her companion with the\r\nfirst faint note of asperity she had ever heard him sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Beale fairly swooped upon her and the effect of the whole hour was\r\nto show the child how much, how quite formidably indeed, after all, she\r\nwas loved. This was the more the case as her stepmother, so changed--in\r\nthe very manner of her mother--that she really struck her as a new\r\nacquaintance, somehow recalled more familiarity than Maisie could feel.\r\nA rich strong expressive affection in short pounced upon her in the\r\nshape of a handsomer, ampler, older Mrs. Beale. It was like making a\r\nfine friend, and they hadn\'t been a minute together before she felt\r\nelated at the way she had met the choice imposed on her in the cab.\r\nThere was a whole future in the combination of Mrs. Beale\'s beauty and\r\nMrs. Beale\'s hug. She seemed to Maisie charming to behold, and also to\r\nhave no connexion at all with anybody who had once mended underclothing\r\nand had meals in the nursery. The child knew one of her father\'s wives\r\nwas a woman of fashion, but she had always dimly made a distinction, not\r\napplying that epithet without reserve to the other. Mrs. Beale had since\r\ntheir separation acquired a conspicuous right to it, and Maisie\'s first\r\nflush of response to her present delight coloured all her splendour with\r\nmeanings that this time were sweet. She had told Sir Claude she was\r\nafraid of the lady in the Regent\'s Park; but she had confidence enough\r\nto break on the spot, into the frankest appreciation. "Why, aren\'t you\r\nbeautiful? Isn\'t she beautiful, Sir Claude, ISN\'T she?"\r\n\r\n"The handsomest woman in London, simply," Sir Claude gallantly replied.\r\n"Just as sure as you\'re the best little girl!"\r\n\r\nWell, the handsomest woman in London gave herself up, with tender\r\nlustrous looks and every demonstration of fondness, to a happiness at\r\nlast clutched again. There was almost as vivid a bloom in her maturity\r\nas in mamma\'s, and it took her but a short time to give her little\r\nfriend an impression of positive power--an impression that seemed to\r\nbegin like a long bright day. This was a perception on Maisie\'s part\r\nthat neither mamma, nor Sir Claude, nor Mrs. Wix, with their immense and\r\nso varied respective attractions, had exactly kindled, and that made an\r\nimmediate difference when the talk, as it promptly did, began to turn to\r\nher father. Oh yes, Mr. Farange was a complication, but she saw now that\r\nhe wouldn\'t be one for his daughter. For Mrs. Beale certainly he was an\r\nimmense one--she speedily made known as much; but Mrs. Beale from this\r\nmoment presented herself to Maisie as a person to whom a great gift had\r\ncome. The great gift was just for handling complications. Maisie felt\r\nhow little she made of them when, after she had dropped to Sir Claude\r\nsome recall of a previous meeting, he made answer, with a sound of\r\nconsternation and yet an air of relief, that he had denied to their\r\ncompanion their having, since the day he came for her, seen each other\r\ntill that moment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale could but vaguely pity it. "Why did you do anything so\r\nsilly?"\r\n\r\n"To protect your reputation."\r\n\r\n"From Maisie?" Mrs. Beale was much amused. "My reputation with Maisie is\r\ntoo good to suffer."\r\n\r\n"But you believed me, you rascal, didn\'t you?" Sir Claude asked of the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him; she smiled. "Her reputation did suffer. I discovered\r\nyou had been here."\r\n\r\nHe was not too chagrined to laugh. "The way, my dear, you talk of that\r\nsort of thing!"\r\n\r\n"How should she talk," Mrs. Beale wanted to know, "after all this\r\nwretched time with her mother?"\r\n\r\n"It was not mamma who told me," Maisie explained. "It was only Mrs.\r\nWix." She was hesitating whether to bring out before Sir Claude the\r\nsource of Mrs. Wix\'s information; but Mrs. Beale, addressing the young\r\nman, showed the vanity of scruples.\r\n\r\n"Do you know that preposterous person came to see me a day or two\r\nago?--when I told her I had seen you repeatedly."\r\n\r\nSir Claude, for once in a way, was disconcerted. "The old cat! She never\r\ntold me. Then you thought I had lied?" he demanded of Maisie.\r\n\r\nShe was flurried by the term with which he had qualified her gentle\r\nfriend, but she took the occasion for one to which she must in every\r\nmanner lend herself. "Oh I didn\'t mind! But Mrs. Wix did," she added\r\nwith an intention benevolent to her governess.\r\n\r\nHer intention was not very effective as regards Mrs. Beale. "Mrs. Wix is\r\ntoo idiotic!" that lady declared.\r\n\r\n"But to you, of all people," Sir Claude asked, "what had she to say?"\r\n\r\n"Why that, like Mrs. Micawber--whom she must, I think, rather\r\nresemble--she will never, never, never desert Miss Farange."\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'ll make that all right!" Sir Claude cheerfully returned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope so, my dear man," said Mrs. Beale, while Maisie\r\nwondered just how he would proceed. Before she had time to ask Mrs.\r\nBeale continued: "That\'s not all she came to do, if you please. But\r\nyou\'ll never guess the rest."\r\n\r\n"Shall _I_ guess it?" Maisie quavered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale was again amused. "Why you\'re just the person! It must be\r\nquite the sort of thing you\'ve heard at your awful mother\'s. Have you\r\nnever seen women there crying to her to \'spare\' the men they love?"\r\n\r\nMaisie, wondering, tried to remember; but Sir Claude was freshly\r\ndiverted. "Oh they don\'t trouble about Ida! Mrs. Wix cried to you to\r\nspare ME?"\r\n\r\n"She regularly went down on her knees to me."\r\n\r\n"The darling old dear!" the young man exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThese words were a joy to Maisie--they made up for his previous\r\ndescription of Mrs. Wix. "And WILL you spare him?" she asked of Mrs.\r\nBeale.\r\n\r\nHer stepmother, seizing her and kissing her again, seemed charmed with\r\nthe tone of her question. "Not an inch of him! I\'ll pick him to the\r\nbone!"\r\n\r\n"You mean that he\'ll really come often?" Maisie pressed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale turned lovely eyes to Sir Claude. "That\'s not for me to\r\nsay--its for him."\r\n\r\nHe said nothing at once, however; with his hands in his pockets\r\nand vaguely humming a tune--even Maisie could see he was a little\r\nnervous--he only walked to the window and looked out at the Regent\'s\r\nPark. "Well, he has promised," Maisie said. "But how will papa like it?"\r\n\r\n"His being in and out? Ah that\'s a question that, to be frank with you,\r\nmy dear, hardly matters. In point of fact, however, Beale greatly enjoys\r\nthe idea that Sir Claude too, poor man, has been forced to quarrel with\r\nyour mother."\r\n\r\nSir Claude turned round and spoke gravely and kindly. "Don\'t be afraid,\r\nMaisie; you won\'t lose sight of me."\r\n\r\n"Thank you so much!" Maisie was radiant. "But what I meant--don\'t you\r\nknow?--was what papa would say to ME."\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'ve been having that out with him," said Mrs. Beale. "He\'ll behave\r\nwell enough. You see the great difficulty is that, though he changes\r\nevery three days about everything else in the world, he has never\r\nchanged about your mother. It\'s a caution, the way he hates her."\r\n\r\nSir Claude gave a short laugh. "It certainly can\'t beat the way she\r\nstill hates HIM!"\r\n\r\n"Well," Mrs. Beale went on obligingly, "nothing can take the place of\r\nthat feeling with either of them, and the best way they can think of to\r\nshow it is for each to leave you as long as possible on the hands of the\r\nother. There\'s nothing, as you\'ve seen for yourself, that makes either\r\nso furious. It isn\'t, asking so little as you do, that you\'re much of\r\nan expense or a trouble; it\'s only that you make each feel so well how\r\nnasty the other wants to be. Therefore Beale goes on loathing your\r\nmother too much to have any great fury left for any one else. Besides,\r\nyou know, I\'ve squared him."\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord!" Sir Claude cried with a louder laugh and turning again to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"_I_ know how!" Maisie was prompt to proclaim. "By letting him do what\r\nhe wants on condition that he lets you also do it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re too delicious, my own pet!"--she was involved in another hug.\r\n"How in the world have I got on so long without you? I\'ve not been\r\nhappy, love," said Mrs. Beale with her cheek to the child\'s.\r\n\r\n"Be happy now!"--she throbbed with shy tenderness.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall be. You\'ll save me."\r\n\r\n"As I\'m saving Sir Claude?" the little girl asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, a trifle at a loss, appealed to her visitor, "Is she\r\nreally?"\r\n\r\nHe showed high amusement at Maisie\'s question. "It\'s dear Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nidea. There may be something in it."\r\n\r\n"He makes me his duty--he makes me his life," Maisie set forth to her\r\nstepmother.\r\n\r\n"Why that\'s what _I_ want to do!"--Mrs. Beale, so anticipated, turned\r\npink with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Well, you can do it together. Then he\'ll HAVE to come!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale by this time had her young friend fairly in her lap and she\r\nsmiled up at Sir Claude. "Shall we do it together?"\r\n\r\nHis laughter had dropped, and for a moment he turned his handsome\r\nserious face not to his hostess, but to his stepdaughter. "Well, it\'s\r\nrather more decent than some things. Upon my soul, the way things are\r\ngoing, it seems to me the only decency!" He had the air of arguing it\r\nout to Maisie, of presenting it, through an impulse of conscience, as a\r\nconnexion in which they could honourably see her participate; though his\r\nplea of mere "decency" might well have appeared to fall below her rosy\r\nlittle vision. "If we\'re not good for YOU" he exclaimed, "I\'ll be hanged\r\nif I know who we shall be good for!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale showed the child an intenser light. "I dare say you WILL save\r\nus--from one thing and another."\r\n\r\n"Oh I know what she\'ll save ME from!" Sir Claude roundly asserted.\r\n"There\'ll be rows of course," he went on.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale quickly took him up. "Yes, but they\'ll be nothing--for you\r\nat least--to the rows your wife makes as it is. I can bear what _I_\r\nsuffer--I can\'t bear what you go through."\r\n\r\n"We\'re doing a good deal for you, you know, young woman," Sir Claude\r\nwent on to Maisie with the same gravity.\r\n\r\nShe coloured with a sense of obligation and the eagerness of her desire\r\nit should be remarked how little was lost on her. "Oh I know!"\r\n\r\n"Then you must keep us all right!" This time he laughed.\r\n\r\n"How you talk to her!" cried Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"No worse than you!" he gaily answered.\r\n\r\n"Handsome is that handsome does!" she returned in the same spirit. "You\r\ncan take off your things," she went on, releasing Maisie.\r\n\r\nThe child, on her feet, was all emotion. "Then I\'m just to stop--this\r\nway?"\r\n\r\n"It will do as well as any other. Sir Claude, to-morrow, will have your\r\nthings brought."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bring them myself. Upon my word I\'ll see them packed!" Sir Claude\r\npromised. "Come here and unbutton."\r\n\r\nHe had beckoned his young companion to where he sat, and he helped\r\nto disengage her from her coverings while Mrs. Beale, from a little\r\ndistance, smiled at the hand he displayed. "There\'s a stepfather for\r\nyou! I\'m bound to say, you know, that he makes up for the want of other\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"He makes up for the want of a nurse!" Sir Claude laughed. "Don\'t you\r\nremember I told you so the very first time?"\r\n\r\n"Remember? It was exactly what made me think so well of you!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing would induce me," the young man said to Maisie, "to tell you\r\nwhat made me think so well of HER." Having divested the child he kissed\r\nher gently and gave her a little pat to make her stand off. The pat was\r\naccompanied with a vague sigh in which his gravity of a moment before\r\ncame back. "All the same, if you hadn\'t had the fatal gift of beauty--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what?" Maisie asked, wondering why he paused. It was the first\r\ntime she had heard of her beauty.\r\n\r\n"Why, we shouldn\'t all be thinking so well of each other!"\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t speaking of personal loveliness--you\'ve not THAT vulgar\r\nbeauty, my dear, at all," Mrs. Beale explained. "He\'s just talking of\r\nplain dull charm of character."\r\n\r\n"Her character\'s the most extraordinary thing in all the world," Sir\r\nClaude stated to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"Oh I know all about that sort of thing!"--she fairly bridled with the\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt gave Maisie somehow a sudden sense of responsibility from which she\r\nsought refuge. "Well, you\'ve got it too, \'that sort of thing\'--you\'ve\r\ngot the fatal gift: you both really have!" she broke out.\r\n\r\n"Beauty of character? My dear boy, we haven\'t a pennyworth!" Sir Claude\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself, sir!" she leaped lightly from Mrs. Beale. "I\'m good\r\nand I\'m clever. What more do you want? For you, I\'ll spare your blushes\r\nand not be personal--I\'ll simply say that you\'re as handsome as you can\r\nstick together."\r\n\r\n"You\'re both very lovely; you can\'t get out of it!"--Maisie felt the\r\nneed of carrying her point. "And it\'s beautiful to see you side by\r\nside."\r\n\r\nSir Claude had taken his hat and stick; he stood looking at her a\r\nmoment. "You\'re a comfort in trouble! But I must go home and pack you."\r\n\r\n"And when will you come back?--to-morrow, to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"You see what we\'re in for!" he said to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can bear it if you can."\r\n\r\nTheir companion gazed from one of them to the other, thinking that\r\nthough she had been happy indeed between Sir Claude and Mrs. Wix she\r\nshould evidently be happier still between Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale. But\r\nit was like being perched on a prancing horse, and she made a movement\r\nto hold on to something. "Then, you know, shan\'t I bid goodbye to Mrs.\r\nWix?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'ll make it all right with her," said Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nMaisie considered. "And with mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Ah mamma!" he sadly laughed.\r\n\r\nEven for the child this was scarcely ambiguous; but Mrs. Beale\r\nendeavoured to contribute to its clearness. "Your mother will crow,\r\nshe\'ll crow--"\r\n\r\n"Like the early bird!" said Sir Claude as she looked about for a\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll need no consolation," Mrs. Beale went on, "for having made your\r\nfather grandly blaspheme."\r\n\r\nMaisie stared. "Will he grandly blaspheme?" It was impressive, it might\r\nhave been out of the Bible, and her question produced a fresh play of\r\ncaresses, in which Sir Claude also engaged. She wondered meanwhile who,\r\nif Mrs. Wix was disposed of, would represent in her life the element of\r\ngeography and anecdote; and she presently surmounted the delicacy she\r\nfelt about asking. "Won\'t there be any one to give me lessons?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale was prepared with a reply that struck her as absolutely\r\nmagnificent. "You shall have such lessons as you\'ve never had in all\r\nyour life. You shall go to courses."\r\n\r\n"Courses?" Maisie had never heard of such things.\r\n\r\n"At institutions--on subjects."\r\n\r\nMaisie continued to stare. "Subjects?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale was really splendid. "All the most important ones. French\r\nliterature--and sacred history. You\'ll take part in classes--with\r\nawfully smart children."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to look thoroughly into the whole thing, you know." And Sir\r\nClaude, with characteristic kindness, gave her a nod of assurance\r\naccompanied by a friendly wink.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Beale went much further. "My dear child, you shall attend\r\nlectures."\r\n\r\nThe horizon was suddenly vast and Maisie felt herself the smaller for\r\nit. "All alone?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; I\'ll attend them with you," said Sir Claude. "They\'ll teach me\r\na lot I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"So they will me," Mrs. Beale gravely admitted. "We\'ll go with her\r\ntogether--it will be charming. It\'s ages," she confessed to Maisie,\r\n"since I\'ve had any time for study. That\'s another sweet way in which\r\nyou\'ll be a motive to us. Oh won\'t the good she\'ll do us be immense?"\r\nshe broke out uncontrollably to Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nHe weighed it; then he replied: "That\'s certainly our idea."\r\n\r\nOf this idea Maisie naturally had less of a grasp, but it inspired her\r\nwith almost equal enthusiasm. If in so bright a prospect there would be\r\nnothing to long for it followed that she wouldn\'t long for Mrs. Wix;\r\nbut her consciousness of her assent to the absence of that fond figure\r\ncaused a pair of words that had often sounded in her ears to ring in\r\nthem again. It showed her in short what her father had always meant by\r\ncalling her mother a "low sneak" and her mother by calling her father\r\none. She wondered if she herself shouldn\'t be a low sneak in learning to\r\nbe so happy without Mrs. Wix. What would Mrs. Wix do?--where would Mrs.\r\nWix go? Before Maisie knew it, and at the door, as Sir Claude was off,\r\nthese anxieties, on her lips, grew articulate and her stepfather had\r\nstopped long enough to answer them. "Oh I\'ll square her!" he cried; and\r\nwith this he departed.\r\n\r\nFace to face with Mrs. Beale, Maisie, giving a sigh of relief, looked\r\nround at what seemed to her the dawn of a higher order. "Then EVERY\r\nONE will be squared!" she peacefully said. On which her stepmother\r\naffectionately bent over her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Susan Ash who came to her with the news: "He\'s downstairs, miss,\r\nand he do look beautiful."\r\n\r\nIn the schoolroom at her father\'s, which had pretty blue curtains, she\r\nhad been making out at the piano a lovely little thing, as Mrs. Beale\r\ncalled it, a "Moonlight Berceuse" sent her through the post by Sir\r\nClaude, who considered that her musical education had been deplorably\r\nneglected and who, the last months at her mother\'s, had been on the\r\npoint of making arrangements for regular lessons. She knew from him\r\nfamiliarly that the real thing, as he said, was shockingly dear and that\r\nanything else was a waste of money, and she therefore rejoiced the more\r\nat the sacrifice represented by this composition, of which the price,\r\nfive shillings, was marked on the cover and which was evidently the real\r\nthing. She was already on her feet. "Mrs. Beale has sent up for me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--it\'s not that," said Susan Ash. "Mrs. Beale has been out this\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n"Then papa!"\r\n\r\n"Dear no--not papa. You\'ll do, miss, all but them wandering \'airs,"\r\nSusan went on. "Your papa never came \'ome at all," she added.\r\n\r\n"Home from where?" Maisie responded a little absently and very\r\nexcitedly. She gave a wild manual brush to her locks.\r\n\r\n"Oh that, miss, I should be very sorry to tell you! I\'d rather tuck away\r\nthat white thing behind--though I\'m blest if it\'s my work."\r\n\r\n"Do then, please. I know where papa was," Maisie impatiently continued.\r\n\r\n"Well, in your place I wouldn\'t tell."\r\n\r\n"He was at the club--the Chrysanthemum. So!"\r\n\r\n"All night long? Why the flowers shut up at night, you know!" cried\r\nSusan Ash.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care"--he child was at the door. "Sir Claude asked for me\r\nALONE?"\r\n\r\n"The same as if you was a duchess."\r\n\r\nMaisie was aware on her way downstairs that she was now quite as happy\r\nas one, and also, a moment later, as she hung round his neck, that\r\neven such a personage would scarce commit herself more grandly. There\r\nwas moreover a hint of the duchess in the infinite point with which,\r\nas she felt, she exclaimed: "And this is what you call coming OFTEN?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude met her delightfully and in the same fine spirit. "My dear\r\nold man, don\'t make me a scene--I assure you it\'s what every woman I\r\nlook at does. Let us have some fun--it\'s a lovely day: clap on something\r\nsmart and come out with me; then we\'ll talk it over quietly."\r\n\r\nThey were on their way five minutes later to Hyde Park, and nothing that\r\neven in the good days at her mother\'s they had ever talked over had more\r\nof the sweetness of tranquillity than his present prompt explanations.\r\nHe was at his best in such an office and with the exception of Mrs. Wix\r\nthe only person she had met in her life who ever explained. With him,\r\nhowever, the act had an authority transcending the wisdom of woman. It\r\nall came back--the plans that always failed, all the rewards and bribes\r\nthat she was perpetually paying for in advance and perpetually out of\r\npocket by afterwards--the whole great stress to be dealt with introduced\r\nher on each occasion afresh to the question of money. Even she herself\r\nalmost knew how it would have expressed the strength of his empire to\r\nsay that to shuffle away her sense of being duped he had only, from\r\nunder his lovely moustache, to breathe upon it. It was somehow in the\r\nnature of plans to be expensive and in the nature of the expensive to be\r\nimpossible. To be "involved" was of the essence of everybody\'s affairs,\r\nand also at every particular moment to be more involved than usual.\r\nThis had been the case with Sir Claude\'s, with papa\'s, with mamma\'s,\r\nwith Mrs. Beale\'s and with Maisie\'s own at the particular moment, a\r\nmoment of several weeks, that had elapsed since our young lady had been\r\nre-established at her father\'s. There wasn\'t "two-and-tuppence" for\r\nanything or for any one, and that was why there had been no sequel to\r\nthe classes in French literature with all the smart little girls. It\r\nwas devilish awkward, didn\'t she see? to try, without even the limited\r\ncapital mentioned, to mix her up with a remote array that glittered\r\nbefore her after this as the children of the rich. She was to feel\r\nhenceforth as if she were flattening her nose upon the hard window-pane\r\nof the sweet-shop of knowledge. If the classes, however, that were\r\nselect, and accordingly the only ones, were impossibly dear, the\r\nlectures at the institutions--at least at some of them--were directly\r\naddressed to the intelligent poor, and it therefore had to be easier\r\nstill to produce on the spot the reason why she had been taken to none.\r\nThis reason, Sir Claude said, was that she happened to be just going to\r\nbe, though they had nothing to do with that in now directing their steps\r\nto the banks of the Serpentine. Maisie\'s own park, in the north, had\r\nbeen nearer at hand, but they rolled westward in a hansom because at the\r\nend of the sweet June days this was the direction taken by every one\r\nthat any one looked at. They cultivated for an hour, on the Row and\r\nby the Drive, this opportunity for each observer to amuse and for one\r\nof them indeed, not a little hilariously, to mystify the other, and\r\nbefore the hour was over Maisie had elicited, in reply to her sharpest\r\nchallenge, a further account of her friend\'s long absence.\r\n\r\n"Why I\'ve broken my word to you so dreadfully--promising so solemnly and\r\nthen never coming? Well, my dear, that\'s a question that, not seeing me\r\nday after day, you must very often have put to Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," the child replied; "again and again."\r\n\r\n"And what has she told you?"\r\n\r\n"That you\'re as bad as you\'re beautiful."\r\n\r\n"Is that what she says?"\r\n\r\n"Those very words."\r\n\r\n"Ah the dear old soul!" Sir Claude was much diverted, and his loud,\r\nclear laugh was all his explanation. Those were just the words Maisie\r\nhad last heard him use about Mrs. Wix. She clung to his hand, which was\r\nencased in a pearl-grey glove ornamented with the thick black lines\r\nthat, at her mother\'s, always used to strike her as connected with the\r\nway the bestitched fists of the long ladies carried, with the elbows\r\nwell out, their umbrellas upside down. The mere sense of his grasp in\r\nher own covered the ground of loss just as much as the ground of gain.\r\nHis presence was like an object brought so close to her face that she\r\ncouldn\'t see round its edges. He himself, however, remained showman of\r\nthe spectacle even after they had passed out of the Park and begun,\r\nunder the charm of the spot and the season, to stroll in Kensington\r\nGardens. What they had left behind them was, as he said, only a pretty\r\nbad circus, and, through prepossessing gates and over a bridge, they\r\nhad come in a quarter of an hour, as he also remarked, a hundred miles\r\nfrom London. A great green glade was before them, and high old trees,\r\nand under the shade of these, in the fresh turf, the crooked course\r\nof a rural footpath. "It\'s the Forest of Arden," Sir Claude had just\r\ndelightfully observed, "and I\'m the banished duke, and you\'re--what was\r\nthe young woman called?--the artless country wench. And there," he went\r\non, "is the other girl--what\'s her name, Rosalind?--and (don\'t you\r\nknow?) the fellow who was making up to her. Upon my word he IS making\r\nup to her!"\r\n\r\nHis allusion was to a couple who, side by side, at the end of the glade,\r\nwere moving in the same direction as themselves. These distant figures,\r\nin their slow stroll (which kept them so close together that their\r\nheads, drooping a little forward, almost touched), presented the back of\r\na lady who looked tall, who was evidently a very fine woman, and that\r\nof a gentleman whose left hand appeared to be passed well into her arm\r\nwhile his right, behind him, made jerky motions with the stick that it\r\ngrasped. Maisie\'s fancy responded for an instant to her friend\'s idea\r\nthat the sight was idyllic; then, stopping short, she brought out with\r\nall her clearness: "Why mercy--if it isn\'t mamma!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude paused with a stare. "Mamma? But mamma\'s at Brussels."\r\n\r\nMaisie, with her eyes on the lady, wondered. "At Brussels?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone to play a match."\r\n\r\n"At billiards? You didn\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I didn\'t!" Sir Claude ejaculated. "There\'s plenty I don\'t\r\ntell you. She went on Wednesday."\r\n\r\nThe couple had added to their distance, but Maisie\'s eyes more than kept\r\npace with them. "Then she has come back."\r\n\r\nSir Claude watched the lady. "It\'s much more likely she never went!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s mamma!" the child said with decision.\r\n\r\nThey had stood still, but Sir Claude had made the most of his\r\nopportunity, and it happened that just at this moment, at the end of the\r\nvista, the others halted and, still showing only their backs, seemed to\r\nstay talking. "Right you are, my duck!" he exclaimed at last. "It\'s my\r\nown sweet wife!"\r\n\r\nHe had spoken with a laugh, but he had changed colour, and Maisie\r\nquickly looked away from him. "Then who is it with her?"\r\n\r\n"Blest if I know!" said Sir Claude.\r\n\r\n"Is it Mr. Perriam?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no--Perriam\'s smashed."\r\n\r\n"Smashed?"\r\n\r\n"Exposed--in the City. But there are quantities of others!" Sir Claude\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nMaisie appeared to count them; she studied the gentleman\'s back. "Then\r\nis this Lord Eric?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment her companion made no answer, and when she turned her eyes\r\nagain to him he was looking at her, she thought, rather queerly. "What\r\ndo you know about Lord Eric?"\r\n\r\nShe tried innocently to be odd in return. "Oh I know more than you\r\nthink! Is it Lord Eric?" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"It maybe. Blest if I care!"\r\n\r\nTheir friends had slightly separated and now, as Sir Claude spoke,\r\nsuddenly faced round, showing all the splendour of her ladyship and all\r\nthe mystery of her comrade. Maisie held her breath. "They\'re coming!"\r\n\r\n"Let them come." And Sir Claude, pulling out his cigarettes, began to\r\nstrike a light.\r\n\r\n"We shall meet them!"\r\n\r\n"No. They\'ll meet US."\r\n\r\nMaisie stood her ground. "They see us. Just look."\r\n\r\nSir Claude threw away his match. "Come straight on." The others, in the\r\nreturn, evidently startled, had half-paused again, keeping well apart.\r\n"She\'s horribly surprised and wants to slope," he continued. "But it\'s\r\ntoo late."\r\n\r\nMaisie advanced beside him, making out even across the interval that her\r\nladyship was ill at ease. "Then what will she do?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude puffed his cigarette. "She\'s quickly thinking." He appeared\r\nto enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIda had wavered but an instant; her companion clearly gave her moral\r\nsupport. Maisie thought he somehow looked brave, and he had no likeness\r\nwhatever to Mr. Perriam. His face, thin and rather sharp, was smooth,\r\nand it was not till they came nearer that she saw he had a remarkably\r\nfair little moustache. She could already see that his eyes were of the\r\nlightest blue. He was far nicer than Mr. Perriam. Mamma looked terrible\r\nfrom afar, but even under her guns the child\'s curiosity flickered and\r\nshe appealed again to Sir Claude. "Is it--IS it Lord Eric?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude smoked composedly enough. "I think it\'s the Count."\r\n\r\nThis was a happy solution--it fitted her idea of a count. But what idea,\r\nas she now came grandly on, did mamma fit?--unless that of an actress,\r\nin some tremendous situation, sweeping down to the footlights as if she\r\nwould jump them. Maisie felt really so frightened that before she knew\r\nit she had passed her hand into Sir Claude\'s arm. Her pressure caused\r\nhim to stop, and at the sight of this the other couple came equally to\r\na stand and, beyond the diminished space, remained a moment more in\r\ntalk. This, however, was the matter of an instant; leaving the Count\r\napparently to come round more circuitously--an outflanking movement, if\r\nMaisie had but known--her ladyship resumed the onset. "What WILL she do\r\nnow?" her daughter asked.\r\n\r\nSir Claude was at present in a position to say: "Try to pretend it\'s\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You?"\r\n\r\n"Why that I\'m up to something."\r\n\r\nIn another minute poor Ida had justified this prediction, erect there\r\nbefore them like a figure of justice in full dress. There were parts of\r\nher face that grew whiter while Maisie looked, and other parts in which\r\nthis change seemed to make other colours reign with more intensity.\r\n"What are you doing with my daughter?" she demanded of her husband; in\r\nspite of the indignant tone of which Maisie had a greater sense than\r\never in her life before of not being personally noticed. It seemed to\r\nher Sir Claude also grew pale as an effect of the loud defiance with\r\nwhich Ida twice repeated this question. He put her, instead of answering\r\nit, an enquiry of his own: "Who the devil have you got hold of NOW?"\r\nand at this her ladyship turned tremendously to the child, glaring at\r\nher as at an equal plotter of sin. Maisie received in petrifaction the\r\nfull force of her mother\'s huge painted eyes--they were like Japanese\r\nlanterns swung under festal arches. But life came back to her from a\r\ntone suddenly and strangely softened. "Go straight to that gentleman, my\r\ndear; I\'ve asked him to take you a few minutes. He\'s charming--go. I\'ve\r\nsomething to say to THIS creature."\r\n\r\nMaisie felt Sir Claude immediately clutch her. "No, no--thank you: that\r\nwon\'t do. She\'s mine."\r\n\r\n"Yours?" It was confounding to Maisie to hear her speak quite as if she\r\nhad never heard of Sir Claude before.\r\n\r\n"Mine. You\'ve given her up. You\'ve not another word to say about her. I\r\nhave her from her father," said Sir Claude--a statement that startled\r\nhis companion, who could also measure its lively action on her mother.\r\n\r\nThere was visibly, however, an influence that made Ida consider; she\r\nglanced at the gentleman she had left, who, having strolled with his\r\nhands in his pockets to some distance, stood there with unembarrassed\r\nvagueness. She directed to him the face that was like an illuminated\r\ngarden, turnstile and all, for the frequentation of which he had his\r\nseason-ticket; then she looked again at Sir Claude. "I\'ve given her\r\nup to her father to KEEP--not to get rid of by sending about the town\r\neither with you or with any one else. If she\'s not to mind me let HIM\r\ncome and tell me so. I decline to take it from another person, and I\r\nlike your pretending that with your humbug of \'interest\' you\'ve a leg to\r\nstand on. I know your game and have something now to say to you about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nSir Claude gave a squeeze of the child\'s arm. "Didn\'t I tell you she\'d\r\nhave, Miss Farange?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re uncommonly afraid to hear it," Ida went on; "but if you think\r\nshe\'ll protect you from it you\'re mightily mistaken." She gave him a\r\nmoment. "I\'ll give her the benefit as soon as look at you. Should you\r\nlike her to know, my dear?" Maisie had a sense of her launching the\r\nquestion with effect; yet our young lady was also conscious of hoping\r\nthat Sir Claude would declare that preference. We have already learned\r\nthat she had come to like people\'s liking her to "know." Before he\r\ncould reply at all, none the less, her mother opened a pair of arms of\r\nextraordinary elegance, and then she felt the loosening of his grasp.\r\n"My own child," Ida murmured in a voice--a voice of sudden confused\r\ntenderness--that it seemed to her she heard for the first time. She\r\nwavered but an instant, thrilled with the first direct appeal, as\r\ndistinguished from the mere maternal pull, she had ever had from lips\r\nthat, even in the old vociferous years, had always been sharp. The next\r\nmoment she was on her mother\'s breast, where, amid a wilderness of\r\ntrinkets, she felt as if she had suddenly been thrust, with a smash of\r\nglass, into a jeweller\'s shop-front, but only to be as suddenly ejected\r\nwith a push and the brisk injunction: "Now go to the Captain!"\r\n\r\nMaisie glanced at the gentleman submissively, but felt the want of more\r\nintroduction. "The Captain?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude broke into a laugh. "I told her it was the Count."\r\n\r\nIda stared; she rose so superior that she was colossal. "You\'re too\r\nutterly loathsome," she then declared. "Be off!" she repeated to her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nMaisie started, moved backward and, looking at Sir Claude, "Only for a\r\nmoment," she signed to him in her bewilderment. But he was too angry\r\nto heed her--too angry with his wife; as she turned away she heard his\r\nanger break out. "You damned old b----"--she couldn\'t quite hear all.\r\nIt was enough, it was too much: she fled before it, rushing even to a\r\nstranger for the shock of such a change of tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she met the Captain\'s light blue eyes the greatest marvel occurred;\r\nshe felt a sudden relief at finding them reply with anxiety to the\r\nhorror in her face. "What in the world has he done?" He put it all on\r\nSir Claude.\r\n\r\n"He has called her a damned old brute." She couldn\'t help bringing that\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, at the same elevation as her ladyship, gaped wide; then of\r\ncourse, like every one else, he was convulsed. But he instantly caught\r\nhimself up, echoing her bad words. "A damned old brute--your mother?"\r\n\r\nMaisie was already conscious of her second movement. "I think she tried\r\nto make him angry."\r\n\r\nThe Captain\'s stupefaction was fine. "Angry--SHE? Why she\'s an angel!"\r\n\r\nOn the spot, as he said this, his face won her over; it was so bright\r\nand kind, and his blue eyes had such a reflexion of some mysterious\r\ngrace that, for him at least, her mother had put forth. Her fund of\r\nobservation enabled her as she gazed up at him to place him: he was a\r\ncandid simple soldier; very grave--she came back to that--but not at\r\nall terrible. At any rate he struck a note that was new to her and that\r\nafter a moment made her say: "Do you like her very much?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled down at her, hesitating, looking pleasanter and pleasanter.\r\n"Let me tell you about your mother."\r\n\r\nHe put out a big military hand which she immediately took, and they\r\nturned off together to where a couple of chairs had been placed under\r\none of the trees. "She told me to come to you," Maisie explained as they\r\nwent; and presently she was close to him in a chair, with the prettiest\r\nof pictures--the sheen of the lake through other trees--before them, and\r\nthe sound of birds, the plash of boats, the play of children in the air.\r\nThe Captain, inclining his military person, sat sideways to be closer\r\nand kinder, and as her hand was on the arm of her seat he put his own\r\ndown on it again to emphasise something he had to say that would be good\r\nfor her to hear. He had already told her how her mother, from the moment\r\nof seeing her so unexpectedly with a person who was--well, not at all\r\nthe right person, had promptly asked him to take charge of her while she\r\nherself tackled, as she said, the real culprit. He gave the child the\r\nsense of doing for the time what he liked with her; ten minutes before\r\nshe had never seen him, but she could now sit there touching him,\r\ntouched and impressed by him and thinking it nice when a gentleman\r\nwas thin and brown--brown with a kind of clear depth that made his\r\nstraw-coloured moustache almost white and his eyes resemble little pale\r\nflowers. The most extraordinary thing was the way she didn\'t appear just\r\nthen to mind Sir Claude\'s being tackled. The Captain wasn\'t a bit like\r\nhim, for it was an odd part of the pleasantness of mamma\'s friend that\r\nit resided in a manner in this friend\'s having a face so informally put\r\ntogether that the only kindness could be to call it funny. An odder part\r\nstill was that it finally made our young lady, to classify him further,\r\nsay to herself that, of all people in the world, he reminded her most\r\ninsidiously of Mrs. Wix. He had neither straighteners nor a diadem, nor,\r\nat least in the same place as the other, a button; he was sun-burnt and\r\ndeep-voiced and smelt of cigars, yet he marvellously had more in common\r\nwith her old governess than with her young stepfather. What he had\r\nto say to her that was good for her to hear was that her poor mother\r\n(didn\'t she know?) was the best friend he had ever had in all his life.\r\nAnd he added: "She has told me ever so much about you. I\'m awfully glad\r\nto know you."\r\n\r\nShe had never, she thought, been so addressed as a young lady, not even\r\nby Sir Claude the day, so long ago, that she found him with Mrs. Beale.\r\nIt struck her as the way that at balls, by delightful partners, young\r\nladies must be spoken to in the intervals of dances; and she tried to\r\nthink of something that would meet it at the same high point. But this\r\neffort flurried her, and all she could produce was: "At first, you know,\r\nI thought you were Lord Eric."\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked vague. "Lord Eric?"\r\n\r\n"And then Sir Claude thought you were the Count."\r\n\r\nAt this he laughed out. "Why he\'s only five foot high and as red as\r\na lobster!" Maisie laughed, with a certain elegance, in return--the\r\nyoung lady at the ball certainly would--and was on the point, as\r\nconscientiously, of pursuing the subject with an agreeable question. But\r\nbefore she could speak her companion challenged her. "Who in the world\'s\r\nLord Eric?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know him?" She judged her young lady would say that with\r\nlight surprise.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean a fat man with his mouth always open?" She had to\r\nconfess that their acquaintance was so limited that she could only\r\ndescribe the bearer of the name as a friend of mamma\'s; but a light\r\nsuddenly came to the Captain, who quickly spoke as knowing her man.\r\n"What-do-you-call-him\'s brother, the fellow that owned Bobolink?" Then,\r\nwith all his kindness, he contradicted her flat. "Oh dear no; your\r\nmother never knew HIM."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs. Wix said so," the child risked.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Wix?"\r\n\r\n"My old governess."\r\n\r\nThis again seemed amusing to the Captain. "She mixed him up, your old\r\ngoverness. He\'s an awful beast. Your mother never looked at him."\r\n\r\nHe was as positive as he was friendly, but he dropped for a minute after\r\nthis into a silence that gave Maisie, confused but ingenious, a chance\r\nto redeem the mistake of pretending to know too much by the humility of\r\ninviting further correction. "And doesn\'t she know the Count?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I dare say! But he\'s another ass." After which abruptly, with a\r\ndifferent look, he put down again on the back of her own the hand he had\r\nmomentarily removed. Maisie even thought he coloured a little. "I want\r\ntremendously to speak to you. You must never believe any harm of your\r\nmother."\r\n\r\n"Oh I assure you I DON\'T!" cried the child, blushing, herself, up to her\r\neyes in a sudden surge of deprecation of such a thought.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, bending his head, raised her hand to his lips with a\r\nbenevolence that made her wish her glove had been nicer. "Of course you\r\ndon\'t when you know how fond she is of YOU."\r\n\r\n"She\'s fond of me?" Maisie panted.\r\n\r\n"Tremendously. But she thinks you don\'t like her. You MUST like her. She\r\nhas had too much to put up with."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--I know!" She rejoiced that she had never denied it.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ve no right to speak of her except as a particular friend,"\r\nthe Captain went on. "But she\'s a splendid woman. She has never had any\r\nsort of justice."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t she?"--his companion, to hear the words, felt a thrill\r\naltogether new.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I oughtn\'t to say it to you, but she has had everything to\r\nsuffer."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--you can SAY it to me!" Maisie hastened to profess.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was glad. "Well, you needn\'t tell. It\'s all for YOU--do you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\nSerious and smiling she only wanted to take it from him. "It\'s between\r\nyou and me! Oh there are lots of things I\'ve never told!"\r\n\r\n"Well, keep this with the rest. I assure you she has had the most\r\ninfernal time, no matter what any one says to the contrary. She\'s the\r\ncleverest woman I ever saw in all my life. She\'s too charming." She had\r\nbeen touched already by his tone, and now she leaned back in her chair\r\nand felt something tremble within her. "She\'s tremendous fun--she can\r\ndo all sorts of things better than I\'ve ever seen any one. She has the\r\npluck of fifty--and I know; I assure you I do. She has the nerve for a\r\ntiger-shoot--by Jove I\'d TAKE her! And she is awfully open and generous,\r\ndon\'t you know? there are women that are such horrid sneaks. She\'ll\r\ngo through anything for any one she likes." He appeared to watch for\r\na moment the effect on his companion of this emphasis; then he gave a\r\nsmall sigh that mourned the limits of the speakable. But it was almost\r\nwith the note of a fresh challenge that he wound up: "Look here, she\'s\r\nTRUE!"\r\n\r\nMaisie had so little desire to assert the contrary that she found\r\nherself, in the intensity of her response, throbbing with a joy still\r\nless utterable than the essence of the Captain\'s admiration. She was\r\nfairly hushed with the sense that he spoke of her mother as she had\r\nnever heard any one speak. It came over her as she sat silent that,\r\nafter all, this admiration and this respect were quite new words, which\r\ntook a distinction from the fact that nothing in the least resembling\r\nthem in quality had on any occasion dropped from the lips of her father,\r\nof Mrs. Beale, of Sir Claude or even of Mrs. Wix. What it appeared to\r\nher to come to was that on the subject of her ladyship it was the first\r\nreal kindness she had heard, so that at the touch of it something\r\nstrange and deep and pitying surged up within her--a revelation that,\r\npractically and so far as she knew, her mother, apart from this,\r\nhad only been disliked. Mrs. Wix\'s original account of Sir Claude\'s\r\naffection seemed as empty now as the chorus in a children\'s game, and\r\nthe husband and wife, but a little way off at that moment, were face to\r\nface in hatred and with the dreadful name he had called her still in the\r\nair. What was it the Captain on the other hand had called her? Maisie\r\nwanted to hear that again. The tears filled her eyes and rolled down\r\nher cheeks, which burned under them with the rush of a consciousness\r\nthat for her too, five minutes before, the vivid towering beauty whose\r\nassault she awaited had been, a moment long, an object of pure dread.\r\nShe became on the spot indifferent to her usual fear of showing what\r\nin children was notoriously most offensive--presented to her companion,\r\nsoundlessly but hideously, her wet distorted face. She cried, with a\r\npang, straight AT him, cried as she had never cried at any one in all\r\nher life. "Oh do you love her?" she brought out with a gulp that was\r\nthe effect of her trying not to make a noise.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless another consequence of the thick mist through which she\r\nsaw him that in reply to her question the Captain gave her such a queer\r\nblurred look. He stammered, yet in his voice there was also the ring of\r\na great awkward insistence. "Of course I\'m tremendously fond of her--I\r\nlike her better than any woman I ever saw. I don\'t mind in the least\r\ntelling you that," he went on, "and I should think myself a great beast\r\nif I did." Then to show that his position was superlatively clear he\r\nmade her, with a kindness that even Sir Claude had never surpassed,\r\ntremble again as she had trembled at his first outbreak. He called her\r\nby her name, and her name drove it home. "My dear Maisie, your mother\'s\r\nan angel!"\r\n\r\nIt was an almost unbelievable balm--it soothed so her impression of\r\ndanger and pain. She sank back in her chair, she covered her face\r\nwith her hands. "Oh mother, mother, mother!" she sobbed. She had an\r\nimpression that the Captain, beside her, if more and more friendly, was\r\nby no means unembarrassed; in a minute, however, when her eyes were\r\nclearer, he was erect in front of her, very red and nervously looking\r\nabout him and whacking his leg with his stick. "Say you love her, Mr.\r\nCaptain; say it, say it!" she implored.\r\n\r\nMr. Captain\'s blue eyes fixed themselves very hard. "Of course I love\r\nher, damn it, you know!"\r\n\r\nAt this she also jumped up; she had fished out somehow her\r\npocket-handkerchief. "So do I then. I do, I do, I do!" she passionately\r\nasseverated.\r\n\r\n"Then will you come back to her?"\r\n\r\nMaisie, staring, stopped the tight little plug of her handkerchief on\r\nthe way to her eyes. "She won\'t have me."\r\n\r\n"Yes she will. She wants you."\r\n\r\n"Back at the house--with Sir Claude?"\r\n\r\nAgain he hung fire. "No, not with him. In another place."\r\n\r\nThey stood looking at each other with an intensity unusual as between a\r\nCaptain and a little girl. "She won\'t have me in any place."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes she will if _I_ ask her!"\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s intensity continued. "Shall you be there?"\r\n\r\nThe Captain\'s, on the whole, did the same. "Oh yes--some day."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t mean now?"\r\n\r\nHe broke into a quick smile. "Will you come now?--go with us for an\r\nhour?"\r\n\r\nMaisie considered. "She wouldn\'t have me even now." She could see that\r\nhe had his idea, but that her tone impressed him. That disappointed her\r\na little, though in an instant he rang out again.\r\n\r\n"She will if I ask her," he repeated. "I\'ll ask her this minute."\r\n\r\nMaisie, turning at this, looked away to where her mother and her\r\nstepfather had stopped. At first, among the trees, nobody was visible;\r\nbut the next moment she exclaimed with expression: "It\'s over--here he\r\ncomes!"\r\n\r\nThe Captain watched the approach of her ladyship\'s husband, who lounged\r\ncomposedly over the grass, making to Maisie with his closed fingers a\r\nlittle movement in the air. "I\'ve no desire to avoid him."\r\n\r\n"Well, you mustn\'t see him," said Maisie.\r\n\r\n"Oh he\'s in no hurry himself!" Sir Claude had stopped to light another\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nShe was vague as to the way it was proper he should feel; but she had a\r\nsense that the Captain\'s remark was rather a free reflexion on it. "Oh\r\nhe doesn\'t care!" she replied.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t care for what?"\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t care who you are. He told me so. Go and ask mamma," she added.\r\n\r\n"If you can come with us? Very good. You really want me not to wait for\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"PLEASE don\'t." But Sir Claude was not yet near, and the Captain had\r\nwith his left hand taken hold of her right, which he familiarly,\r\nsociably swung a little. "Only first," she continued, "tell me this. Are\r\nyou going to LIVE with mamma?"\r\n\r\nThe immemorial note of mirth broke out at her seriousness. "One of these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\nShe wondered, wholly unperturbed by his laughter. "Then where will Sir\r\nClaude be?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll have left her of course."\r\n\r\n"Does he really intend to do that?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve every opportunity to ask him."\r\n\r\nMaisie shook her head with decision. "He won\'t do it. Not first."\r\n\r\nHer "first" made the Captain laugh out again. "Oh he\'ll be sure to be\r\nnasty! But I\'ve said too much to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, I\'ll never tell," said Maisie.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s all for yourself. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye." Maisie kept his hand long enough to add: "I like you too."\r\nAnd then supremely: "You DO love her?"\r\n\r\n"My dear child--!" The Captain wanted words.\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t do it only for just a little."\r\n\r\n"A little?"\r\n\r\n"Like all the others."\r\n\r\n"All the others?"--he stood staring.\r\n\r\nShe pulled away her hand. "Do it always!" She bounded to meet Sir\r\nClaude, and as she left the Captain she heard him ring out with apparent\r\ngaiety:\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'m in for it!"\r\n\r\nAs she joined Sir Claude she noted her mother in the distance move\r\nslowly off, and, glancing again at the Captain, saw him, swinging his\r\nstick, retreat in the same direction.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen Sir Claude look as he looked just then; flushed yet\r\nnot excited--settled rather in an immoveable disgust and at once very\r\nsick and very hard. His conversation with her mother had clearly drawn\r\nblood, and the child\'s old horror came back to her, begetting the\r\ninstant moral contraction of the days when her parents had looked to\r\nher to feed their love of battle. Her greatest fear for the moment,\r\nhowever, was that her friend would see she had been crying. The next\r\nshe became aware that he had glanced at her, and it presently occurred\r\nto her that he didn\'t even wish to be looked at. At this she quickly\r\nremoved her gaze, while he said rather curtly: "Well, who in the world\r\nIS the fellow?"\r\n\r\nShe felt herself flooded with prudence. "Oh _I_ haven\'t found out!" This\r\nsounded as if she meant he ought to have done so himself; but she could\r\nonly face doggedly the ugliness of seeming disagreeable, as she used to\r\nface it in the hours when her father, for her blankness, called her a\r\ndirty little donkey, and her mother, for her falsity, pushed her out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Then what have you been doing all this time?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I don\'t know!" It was of the essence of her method not to be silly\r\nby halves.\r\n\r\n"Then didn\'t the beast say anything?" They had got down by the lake and\r\nwere walking fast.\r\n\r\n"Well, not very much."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t speak of your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, a little!"\r\n\r\n"Then what I ask you, please, is HOW?" She kept silence--so long that\r\nhe presently went on: "I say, you know--don\'t you hear me?" At this she\r\nproduced: "Well, I\'m afraid I didn\'t attend to him very much."\r\n\r\nSir Claude, smoking rather hard, made no immediate rejoinder; but\r\nfinally he exclaimed: "Then my dear--with such a chance--you were the\r\nperfection of a dunce!" He was so irritated--or she took him to be--that\r\nfor the rest of the time they were in the Gardens he spoke no other\r\nword; and she meanwhile subtly abstained from any attempt to pacify him.\r\nThat would only lead to more questions. At the gate of the Gardens he\r\nhailed a four-wheeled cab and, in silence, without meeting her eyes, put\r\nher into it, only saying "Give him THAT" as he tossed half a crown upon\r\nthe seat. Even when from outside he had closed the door and told the man\r\nwhere to go he never took her departing look. Nothing of this kind had\r\never yet happened to them, but it had no power to make her love him\r\nless; so she could not only bear it, she felt as she drove away--she\r\ncould rejoice in it. It brought again the sweet sense of success that,\r\nages before, she had had at a crisis when, on the stairs, returning from\r\nher father\'s, she had met a fierce question of her mother\'s with an\r\nimbecility as deep and had in consequence been dashed by Mrs. Farange\r\nalmost to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIf for reasons of her own she could bear the sense of Sir Claude\'s\r\ndispleasure her young endurance might have been put to a serious test.\r\nThe days went by without his knocking at her father\'s door, and the\r\ntime would have turned sadly to waste if something hadn\'t conspicuously\r\nhappened to give it a new difference. What took place was a marked\r\nchange in the attitude of Mrs. Beale--a change that somehow, even\r\nin his absence, seemed to bring Sir Claude again into the house. It\r\nbegan practically with a conversation that occurred between them the\r\nday Maisie, came home alone in the cab. Mrs. Beale had by that time\r\nreturned, and she was more successful than their friend in extracting\r\nfrom our young lady an account of the extraordinary passage with the\r\nCaptain. She came back to it repeatedly, and on the very next day it\r\ngrew distinct to the child that she was already in full possession of\r\nwhat at the same moment had been enacted between her ladyship and Sir\r\nClaude. This was the real origin of her final perception that though he\r\ndidn\'t come to the house her stepmother had some rare secret for not\r\nbeing quite without him. This led to some rare passages with Mrs. Beale,\r\nthe promptest of which had been--not on Maisie\'s part--a wonderful\r\noutbreak of tears. Mrs. Beale was not, as she herself said, a crying\r\ncreature: she hadn\'t cried, to Maisie\'s knowledge, since the lowly\r\ngoverness days, the grey dawn of their connexion. But she wept now with\r\npassion, professing loudly that it did her good and saying remarkable\r\nthings to her charge, for whom the occasion was an equal benefit, an\r\naddition to all the fine precautionary wisdom stored away. It somehow\r\nhadn\'t violated that wisdom, Maisie felt, for her to have told Mrs.\r\nBeale what she had not told Sir Claude, inasmuch as the greatest strain,\r\nto her sense, was between Sir Claude and Sir Claude\'s wife, and his wife\r\nwas just what Mrs. Beale was unfortunately not. He sent his stepdaughter\r\nthree days after the incident in Kensington Gardens a message as frank\r\nas it was tender, and that was how Mrs. Beale had had to bring out in\r\na manner that seemed half an appeal, half a defiance: "Well yes, hang\r\nit--I DO see him!"\r\n\r\nHow and when and where, however, were just what Maisie was not to\r\nknow--an exclusion moreover that she never questioned in the light of\r\na participation large enough to make him, while she shared the ample\r\nvoid of Mrs. Beale\'s rather blank independence, shine in her yearning\r\neye like the single, the sovereign window-square of a great dim\r\ndisproportioned room. As far as her father was concerned such hours\r\nhad no interruption; and then it was clear between them that each\r\nwas thinking of the absent and thinking the other thought, so that he\r\nwas an object of conscious reference in everything they said or did.\r\nThe wretched truth, Mrs. Beale had to confess, was that she had hoped\r\nagainst hope and that in the Regent\'s Park it was impossible Sir Claude\r\nshould really be in and out. Hadn\'t they at last to look the fact in the\r\nface?--it was too disgustingly evident that no one after all had been\r\nsquared. Well, if no one had been squared it was because every one had\r\nbeen vile. No one and every one were of course Beale and Ida, the extent\r\nof whose power to be nasty was a thing that, to a little girl, Mrs.\r\nBeale simply couldn\'t give chapter and verse for. Therefore it was that\r\nto keep going at all, as she said, that lady had to make, as she also\r\nsaid, another arrangement--the arrangement in which Maisie was included\r\nonly to the point of knowing it existed and wondering wistfully what it\r\nwas. Conspicuously at any rate it had a side that was responsible for\r\nMrs. Beale\'s sudden emotion and sudden confidence--a demonstration\r\nthis, however, of which the tearfulness was far from deterrent to our\r\nheroine\'s thought of how happy she should be if she could only make an\r\narrangement for herself. Mrs. Beale\'s own operated, it appeared, with\r\nregularity and frequency; for it was almost every day or two that she\r\nwas able to bring Maisie a message and to take one back. It had been\r\nover the vision of what, as she called it, he did for her that she\r\nbroke down; and this vision was kept in a manner before Maisie by a\r\nsubsequent increase not only of the gaiety, but literally--it seemed not\r\npresumptuous to perceive--of the actual virtue of her friend. The friend\r\nwas herself the first to proclaim it: he had pulled her up immensely--he\r\nhad quite pulled her round. She had charming tormenting words about him:\r\nhe was her good fairy, her hidden spring--above all he was just her\r\n"higher" conscience. That was what had particularly come out with her\r\nstartling tears: he had made her, dear man, think ever so much better of\r\nherself. It had been thus rather surprisingly revealed that she had been\r\nin a way to think ill, and Maisie was glad to hear of the corrective at\r\nthe same time that she heard of the ailment.\r\n\r\nShe presently found herself supposing, and in spite of her envy even\r\nhoping, that whenever Mrs. Beale was out of the house Sir Claude had\r\nin some manner the satisfaction of it. This was now of more frequent\r\noccurrence than ever before--so much so that she would have thought of\r\nher stepmother as almost extravagantly absent had it not been that, in\r\nthe first place, her father was a superior specimen of that habit: it\r\nwas the frequent remark of his present wife, as it had been, before the\r\ntribunals of their country, a prominent plea of her predecessor, that\r\nhe scarce came home even to sleep. In the second place Mrs. Beale, when\r\nshe WAS on the spot, had now a beautiful air of longing to make up for\r\neverything. The only shadow in such bright intervals was that, as Maisie\r\nput it to herself, she could get nothing by questions. It was in the\r\nnature of things to be none of a small child\'s business, even when a\r\nsmall child had from the first been deluded into a fear that she might\r\nbe only too much initiated. Things then were in Maisie\'s experience so\r\ntrue to their nature that questions were almost always improper; but\r\nshe learned on the other hand soon to recognise how at last, sometimes,\r\npatient little silences and intelligent little looks could be rewarded\r\nby delightful little glimpses. There had been years at Beale Farange\'s\r\nwhen the monosyllable "he" meant always, meant almost violently, the\r\nmaster; but all that was changed at a period at which Sir Claude\'s\r\nmerits were of themselves so much in the air that it scarce took even\r\ntwo letters to name him. "He keeps me up splendidly--he does, my own\r\nprecious," Mrs. Beale would observe to her comrade; or else she would\r\nsay that the situation at the other establishment had reached a point\r\nthat could scarcely be believed--the point, monstrous as it sounded,\r\nof his not having laid eyes upon her for twelve days. "She" of course\r\nat Beale Farange\'s had never meant any one but Ida, and there was the\r\ndifference in this case that it now meant Ida with renewed intensity.\r\nMrs. Beale--it was striking--was in a position to animadvert more and\r\nmore upon her dreadfulness, the moral of all which appeared to be how\r\nabominably yet blessedly little she had to do with her husband. This\r\nflow of information came home to our two friends because, truly, Mrs.\r\nBeale had not much more to do with her own; but that was one of the\r\nreflexions that Maisie could make without allowing it to break the\r\nspell of her present sympathy. How could such a spell be anything but\r\ndeep when Sir Claude\'s influence, operating from afar, at last really\r\ndetermined the resumption of his stepdaughter\'s studies? Mrs. Beale\r\nagain took fire about them and was quite vivid for Maisie as to their\r\nbeing the great matter to which the dear absent one kept her up.\r\n\r\nThis was the second source--I have just alluded to the first--of the\r\nchild\'s consciousness of something that, very hopefully, she described\r\nto herself as a new phase; and it also presented in the brightest light\r\nthe fresh enthusiasm with which Mrs. Beale always reappeared and which\r\nreally gave Maisie a happier sense than she had yet had of being very\r\ndear at least to two persons. That she had small remembrance at present\r\nof a third illustrates, I am afraid, a temporary oblivion of Mrs. Wix,\r\nan accident to be explained only by a state of unnatural excitement. For\r\nwhat was the form taken by Mrs. Beale\'s enthusiasm and acquiring relief\r\nin the domestic conditions still left to her but the delightful form of\r\n"reading" with her little charge on lines directly prescribed and in\r\nworks profusely supplied by Sir Claude? He had got hold of an awfully\r\ngood list--"mostly essays, don\'t you know?" Mrs. Beale had said; a word\r\nalways august to Maisie, but henceforth to be softened by hazy, in fact\r\nby quite languorous edges. There was at any rate a week in which no less\r\nthan nine volumes arrived, and the impression was to be gathered from\r\nMrs. Beale that the obscure intercourse she enjoyed with Sir Claude not\r\nonly involved an account and a criticism of studies, but was organised\r\nalmost for the very purpose of report and consultation. It was for\r\nMaisie\'s education in short that, as she often repeated, she closed her\r\ndoor--closed it to the gentlemen who used to flock there in such numbers\r\nand whom her husband\'s practical desertion of her would have made it a\r\ncourse of the highest indelicacy to receive. Maisie was familiar from of\r\nold with the principle at least of the care that a woman, as Mrs. Beale\r\nphrased it, attractive and exposed must take of her "character," and was\r\nduly impressed with the rigour of her stepmother\'s scruples. There was\r\nliterally no one of the other sex whom she seemed to feel at liberty to\r\nsee at home, and when the child risked an enquiry about the ladies who,\r\none by one, during her own previous period, had been made quite loudly\r\nwelcome, Mrs. Beale hastened to inform her that, one by one, they had,\r\nthe fiends, been found out, after all, to be awful. If she wished to\r\nknow more about them she was recommended to approach her father.\r\n\r\nMaisie had, however, at the very moment of this injunction much livelier\r\ncuriosities, for the dream of lectures at an institution had at last\r\nbecome a reality, thanks to Sir Claude\'s now unbounded energy in\r\ndiscovering what could be done. It stood out in this connexion that when\r\nyou came to look into things in a spirit of earnestness an immense deal\r\ncould be done for very little more than your fare in the Underground.\r\nThe institution--there was a splendid one in a part of the town but\r\nlittle known to the child--became, in the glow of such a spirit, a\r\nthrilling place, and the walk to it from the station through Glower\r\nStreet (a pronunciation for which Mrs. Beale once laughed at her little\r\nfriend) a pathway literally strewn with "subjects." Maisie imagined\r\nherself to pluck them as she went, though they thickened in the great\r\ngrey rooms where the fountain of knowledge, in the form usually of a\r\nhigh voice that she took at first to be angry, plashed in the stillness\r\nof rows of faces thrust out like empty jugs. "It MUST do us good--it\'s\r\nall so hideous," Mrs. Beale had immediately declared; manifesting a\r\npurity of resolution that made these occasions quite the most harmonious\r\nof all the many on which the pair had pulled together. Maisie certainly\r\nhad never, in such an association, felt so uplifted, and never above\r\nall been so carried off her feet, as at the moments of Mrs. Beale\'s\r\nbreathlessly re-entering the house and fairly shrieking upstairs to\r\nknow if they should still be in time for a lecture. Her stepdaughter,\r\nall ready from the earliest hours, almost leaped over the banister to\r\nrespond, and they dashed out together in quest of learning as hard as\r\nthey often dashed back to release Mrs. Beale for other preoccupations.\r\nThere had been in short no bustle like these particular spasms, once\r\nthey had broken out, since that last brief flurry when Mrs. Wix, blowing\r\nas if she were grooming her, "made up" for everything previously lost at\r\nher father\'s.\r\n\r\nThese weeks as well were too few, but they were flooded with a new\r\nemotion, part of which indeed came from the possibility that, through\r\nthe long telescope of Glower Street, or perhaps between the pillars of\r\nthe institution--which impressive objects were what Maisie thought most\r\nmade it one--they should some day spy Sir Claude. That was what Mrs.\r\nBeale, under pressure, had said--doubtless a little impatiently: "Oh\r\nyes, oh yes, some day!" His joining them was clearly far less of a\r\nmatter of course than was to have been gathered from his original\r\nprofession of desire to improve in their company his own mind; and\r\nthis sharpened our young lady\'s guess that since that occasion either\r\nsomething destructive had happened or something desirable hadn\'t. Mrs.\r\nBeale had thrown but a partial light in telling her how it had turned\r\nout that nobody had been squared. Maisie wished at any rate that\r\nsomebody WOULD be squared. However, though in every approach to the\r\ntemple of knowledge she watched in vain for Sir Claude, there was\r\nno doubt about the action of his loved image as an incentive and a\r\nrecompense. When the institution was most on pillars--or, as Mrs. Beale\r\nput it, on stilts--when the subject was deepest and the lecture longest\r\nand the listeners ugliest, then it was they both felt their patron in\r\nthe background would be most pleased with them. One day, abruptly, with\r\na glance at this background, Mrs. Beale said to her companion: "We\'ll\r\ngo to-night to the thingumbob at Earl\'s Court"; an announcement putting\r\nforth its full lustre when she had made known that she referred to\r\nthe great Exhibition just opened in that quarter, a collection of\r\nextraordinary foreign things in tremendous gardens, with illuminations,\r\nbands, elephants, switchbacks and side-shows, as well as crowds of\r\npeople among whom they might possibly see some one they knew. Maisie\r\nflew in the same bound at the neck of her friend and at the name of Sir\r\nClaude, on which Mrs. Beale confessed that--well, yes, there was just a\r\nchance that he would be able to meet them. He never of course, in his\r\nterrible position, knew what might happen from hour to hour; but he\r\nhoped to be free and he had given Mrs. Beale the tip. "Bring her there\r\non the quiet and I\'ll try to turn up"--this was clear enough on what\r\nso many weeks of privation had made of his desire to see the child: it\r\neven appeared to represent on his part a yearning as constant as her\r\nown. That in turn was just puzzling enough to make Maisie express a\r\nbewilderment. She couldn\'t see, if they were so intensely of the same\r\nmind, why the theory on which she had come back to Mrs. Beale, the\r\ngeneral reunion, the delightful trio, should have broken down so in\r\nfact. Mrs. Beale furthermore only gave her more to think about in saying\r\nthat their disappointment was the result of his having got into his head\r\na kind of idea.\r\n\r\n"What kind of idea?"\r\n\r\n"Oh goodness knows!" She spoke with an approach to asperity. "He\'s so\r\nawfully delicate."\r\n\r\n"Delicate?"--that was ambiguous.\r\n\r\n"About what he does, don\'t you know?" said Mrs. Beale. She fumbled.\r\n"Well, about what WE do."\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered. "You and me?"\r\n\r\n"Me and HIM, silly!" cried Mrs. Beale with, this time, a real giggle.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t do any harm--YOU don\'t," said Maisie, wondering afresh\r\nand intending her emphasis as a decorous allusion to her parents.\r\n\r\n"Of course we don\'t, you angel--that\'s just the ground _I_ take!" her\r\ncompanion exultantly responded. "He says he doesn\'t want you mixed up."\r\n\r\n"Mixed up with what?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what _I_ want to know: mixed up with what, and how you\r\nare any more mixed--?" Mrs. Beale paused without ending her question.\r\nShe ended after an instant in a different way. "All you can say is that\r\nit\'s his fancy."\r\n\r\nThe tone of this, in spite of its expressing a resignation, the fruit of\r\nweariness, that dismissed the subject, conveyed so vividly how much such\r\na fancy was not Mrs. Beale\'s own that our young lady was led by the mere\r\nfact of contact to arrive at a dim apprehension of the unuttered and the\r\nunknown. The relation between her step-parents had then a mysterious\r\nresiduum; this was the first time she really had reflected that except\r\nas regards herself it was not a relationship. To each other it was only\r\nwhat they might have happened to make it, and she gathered that this,\r\nin the event, had been something that led Sir Claude to keep away from\r\nher. Didn\'t he fear she would be compromised? The perception of such a\r\nscruple endeared him the more, and it flashed over her that she might\r\nsimplify everything by showing him how little she made of such a danger.\r\nHadn\'t she lived with her eyes on it from her third year? It was the\r\ncondition most frequently discussed at the Faranges\', where the word was\r\nalways in the air and where at the age of five, amid rounds of applause,\r\nshe could gabble it off. She knew as well in short that a person could\r\nbe compromised as that a person could be slapped with a hair-brush or\r\nleft alone in the dark, and it was equally familiar to her that each of\r\nthese ordeals was in general held to have too little effect. But the\r\nfirst thing was to make absolutely sure of Mrs. Beale. This was done by\r\nsaying to her thoughtfully: "Well, if you don\'t mind--and you really\r\ndon\'t, do you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, with a dawn of amusement, considered. "Mixing you up? Not a\r\nbit. For what does it mean?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever it means I don\'t in the least mind BEING mixed. Therefore if\r\nyou don\'t and I don\'t," Maisie concluded, "don\'t you think that when I\r\nsee him this evening I had better just tell him we don\'t and ask him why\r\nin the world HE should?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child, however, was not destined to enjoy much of Sir Claude at the\r\n"thingumbob," which took for them a very different turn indeed. On the\r\nspot Mrs. Beale, with hilarity, had urged her to the course proposed;\r\nbut later, at the Exhibition, she withdrew this allowance, mentioning as\r\na result of second thoughts that when a man was so sensitive anything at\r\nall frisky usually made him worse. It would have been hard indeed for\r\nSir Claude to be "worse," Maisie felt, as, in the gardens and the crowd,\r\nwhen the first dazzle had dropped, she looked for him in vain up and\r\ndown. They had all their time, the couple, for frugal wistful wandering:\r\nthey had partaken together at home of the light vague meal--Maisie\'s\r\nname for it was a "jam-supper"--to which they were reduced when Mr.\r\nFarange sought his pleasure abroad. It was abroad now entirely that Mr.\r\nFarange pursued this ideal, and it was the actual impression of his\r\ndaughter, derived from his wife, that he had three days before joined a\r\nfriend\'s yacht at Cowes.\r\n\r\nThe place was full of side-shows, to which Mrs. Beale could introduce\r\nthe little girl only, alas, by revealing to her so attractive, so\r\nenthralling a name: the side-shows, each time, were sixpence apiece,\r\nand the fond allegiance enjoyed by the elder of our pair had been\r\nestablished from the earliest time in spite of a paucity of sixpences.\r\nSmall coin dropped from her as half-heartedly as answers from bad\r\nchildren to lessons that had not been looked at. Maisie passed more\r\nslowly the great painted posters, pressing with a linked arm closer\r\nto her friend\'s pocket, where she hoped for the audible chink of a\r\nshilling. But the upshot of this was but to deepen her yearning: if Sir\r\nClaude would only at last come the shillings would begin to ring. The\r\ncompanions paused, for want of one, before the Flowers of the Forest, a\r\nlarge presentment of bright brown ladies--they were brown all over--in\r\na medium suggestive of tropical luxuriance, and there Maisie dolorously\r\nexpressed her belief that he would never come at all. Mrs. Beale\r\nhereupon, though discernibly disappointed, reminded her that he had not\r\nbeen promised as a certainty--a remark that caused the child to gaze at\r\nthe Flowers through a blur in which they became more magnificent, yet\r\noddly more confused, and by which moreover confusion was imparted to the\r\naspect of a gentleman who at that moment, in the company of a lady, came\r\nout of the brilliant booth. The lady was so brown that Maisie at first\r\ntook her for one of the Flowers; but during the few seconds that this\r\nrequired--a few seconds in which she had also desolately given up Sir\r\nClaude--she heard Mrs. Beale\'s voice, behind her, gather both wonder and\r\npain into a single sharp little cry.\r\n\r\n"Of all the wickedness--BEALE!"\r\n\r\nHe had already, without distinguishing them in the mass of strollers,\r\nturned another way--it seemed at the brown lady\'s suggestion. Her course\r\nwas marked, over heads and shoulders, by an upright scarlet plume, as to\r\nthe ownership of which Maisie was instantly eager. "Who is she--who is\r\nshe?"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Beale for a moment only looked after them. "The liar--the\r\nliar!"\r\n\r\nMaisie considered. "Because he\'s not--where one thought?" That was also,\r\na month ago in Kensington Gardens, where her mother had not been.\r\n"Perhaps he has come back," she was quick to contribute.\r\n\r\n"He never went--the hound!"\r\n\r\nThat, according to Sir Claude, had been also what her mother had not\r\ndone, and Maisie could only have a sense of something that in a maturer\r\nmind would be called the way history repeats itself.\r\n\r\n"Who IS she?" she asked again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, fixed to the spot, seemed lost in the vision of an\r\nopportunity missed. "If he had only seen me!"--it came from between her\r\nteeth. "She\'s a brand-new one. But he must have been with her since\r\nTuesday."\r\n\r\nMaisie took it in. "She\'s almost black," she then reported.\r\n\r\n"They\'re always hideous," said Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\nThis was a remark on which the child had again to reflect. "Oh not his\r\nWIVES!" she remonstrantly exclaimed. The words at another moment would\r\nprobably have set her friend "off," but Mrs. Beale was now, in her\r\ninstant vigilance, too immensely "on." "Did you ever in your life see\r\nsuch a feather?" Maisie presently continued.\r\n\r\nThis decoration appeared to have paused at some distance, and in spite\r\nof intervening groups they could both look at it. "Oh that\'s the way\r\nthey dress--the vulgarest of the vulgar!"\r\n\r\n"They\'re coming back--they\'ll see us!" Maisie the next moment cried;\r\nand while her companion answered that this was exactly what she wanted\r\nand the child returned "Here they are--here they are!" the unconscious\r\nsubjects of so much attention, with a change of mind about their\r\ndirection, quickly retraced their steps and precipitated themselves upon\r\ntheir critics. Their unconsciousness gave Mrs. Beale time to leap, under\r\nher breath, to a recognition which Maisie caught.\r\n\r\n"It must be Mrs. Cuddon!"\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at Mrs. Cuddon hard--her lips even echoed the name. What\r\nfollowed was extraordinarily rapid--a minute of livelier battle than had\r\never yet, in so short a span at least, been waged round our heroine. The\r\nmuffled shock--lest people should notice--was violent, and it was only\r\nfor her later thought that the steps fell into their order, the steps\r\nthrough which, in a bewilderment not so much of sound as of silence, she\r\nhad come to find herself, too soon for comprehension and too strangely\r\nfor fear, at the door of the Exhibition with her father. He thrust her\r\ninto a hansom and got in after her, and then it was--as she drove along\r\nwith him--that she recovered a little what had happened. Face to face\r\nwith them in the gardens he had seen them, and there had been a moment\r\nof checked concussion during which, in a glare of black eyes and a\r\ntoss of red plumage, Mrs. Cuddon had recognised them, ejaculated and\r\nvanished. There had been another moment at which she became aware of Sir\r\nClaude, also poised there in surprise, but out of her father\'s view, as\r\nif he had been warned off at the very moment of reaching them. It fell\r\ninto its place with all the rest that she had heard Mrs. Beale say to\r\nher father, but whether low or loud was now lost to her, something\r\nabout his having this time a new one; on which he had growled something\r\nindistinct but apparently in the tone and of the sort that the child,\r\nfrom her earliest years, had associated with hearing somebody retort\r\nto somebody that somebody was "another." "Oh I stick to the old!" Mrs.\r\nBeale had then quite loudly pronounced; and her accent, even as the cab\r\ngot away, was still in the air, Maisie\'s effective companion having\r\nspoken no other word from the moment of whisking her off--none at least\r\nsave the indistinguishable address which, over the top of the hansom and\r\npoised on the step, he had given the driver. Reconstructing these things\r\nlater Maisie theorised that she at this point would have put a question\r\nto him had not the silence into which he charmed her or scared her--she\r\ncould scarcely tell which--come from his suddenly making her feel his\r\narm about her, feel, as he drew her close, that he was agitated in a way\r\nhe had never yet shown her. It struck her he trembled, trembled too much\r\nto speak, and this had the effect of making her, with an emotion which,\r\nthough it had begun to throb in an instant, was by no means all dread,\r\nconform to his portentous hush. The act of possession that his pressure\r\nin a manner advertised came back to her after the longest of the long\r\nintermissions that had ever let anything come back. They drove and\r\ndrove, and he kept her close; she stared straight before her, holding\r\nher breath, watching one dark street succeed another and strangely\r\nconscious that what it all meant was somehow that papa was less to be\r\nleft out of everything than she had supposed. It took her but a minute\r\nto surrender to this discovery, which, in the form of his present\r\nembrace, suggested a purpose in him prodigiously reaffirmed and with\r\nthat a confused confidence. She neither knew exactly what he had done\r\nnor what he was doing; she could only, altogether impressed and rather\r\nproud, vibrate with the sense that he had jumped up to do something and\r\nthat she had as quickly become a part of it. It was a part of it too\r\nthat here they were at a house that seemed not large, but in the fresh\r\nwhite front of which the street-lamp showed a smartness of flower-boxes.\r\nThe child had been in thousands of stories--all Mrs. Wix\'s and her own,\r\nto say nothing of the richest romances of French Elise--but she had\r\nnever been in such a story as this. By the time he had helped her out\r\nof the cab, which drove away, and she heard in the door of the house\r\nthe prompt little click of his key, the Arabian Nights had quite closed\r\nround her.\r\n\r\nFrom this minute that pitch of the wondrous was in everything,\r\nparticularly in such an instant "Open Sesame" and in the departure of\r\nthe cab, a rattling void filled with relinquished step-parents; it was,\r\nwith the vividness, the almost blinding whiteness of the light that\r\nsprang responsive to papa\'s quick touch of a little brass knob on the\r\nwall, in a place that, at the top of a short soft staircase, struck her\r\nas the most beautiful she had ever seen in her life. The next thing she\r\nperceived it to be was the drawing-room of a lady--of a lady, she could\r\nsee in a moment, and not of a gentleman, not even of one like papa\r\nhimself or even like Sir Claude--whose things were as much prettier than\r\nmamma\'s as it had always had to be confessed that mamma\'s were prettier\r\nthan Mrs. Beale\'s. In the middle of the small bright room and the\r\npresence of more curtains and cushions, more pictures and mirrors, more\r\npalm-trees drooping over brocaded and gilded nooks, more little silver\r\nboxes scattered over little crooked tables and little oval miniatures\r\nhooked upon velvet screens than Mrs. Beale and her ladyship together\r\ncould, in an unnatural alliance, have dreamed of mustering, the child\r\nbecame aware, with a sharp foretaste of compassion, of something that\r\nwas strangely like a relegation to obscurity of each of those women of\r\ntaste. It was a stranger operation still that her father should on the\r\nspot be presented to her as quite advantageously and even grandly at\r\nhome in the dazzling scene and himself by so much the more separated\r\nfrom scenes inferior to it. She spent with him in it, while explanations\r\ncontinued to hang back, twenty minutes that, in their sudden drop of\r\ndanger, affected her, though there were neither buns nor ginger-beer,\r\nlike an extemporised expensive treat.\r\n\r\n"Is she very rich?" He had begun to strike her as almost embarrassed, so\r\nshy that he might have found himself with a young lady with whom he had\r\nlittle in common. She was literally moved by this apprehension to offer\r\nhim some tactful relief.\r\n\r\nBeale Farange stood and smiled at his young lady, his back to\r\nthe fanciful fireplace, his light overcoat--the very lightest in\r\nLondon--wide open, and his wonderful lustrous beard completely\r\nconcealing the expanse of his shirt-front. It pleased her more than ever\r\nto think that papa was handsome and, though as high aloft as mamma and\r\nalmost, in his specially florid evening-dress, as splendid, of a beauty\r\nsomehow less belligerent, less terrible.\r\n\r\n"The Countess? Why do you ask me that?"\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s eyes opened wider. "Is she a Countess?"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to treat her wonder as a positive tribute. "Oh yes, my dear,\r\nbut it isn\'t an English title."\r\n\r\nHer manner appreciated this. "Is it a French one?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor French either. It\'s American."\r\n\r\nShe conversed agreeably. "Ah then of course she must be rich." She took\r\nin such a combination of nationality and rank. "I never saw anything so\r\nlovely."\r\n\r\n"Did you have a sight of her?" Beale asked.\r\n\r\n"At the Exhibition?" Maisie smiled. "She was gone too quick."\r\n\r\nHer father laughed. "She did slope!" She had feared he would say\r\nsomething about Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude, yet the way he spared them\r\nmade her rather uneasy too. All he risked was, the next minute, "She has\r\na horror of vulgar scenes."\r\n\r\nThis was something she needn\'t take up; she could still continue bland.\r\n"But where do you suppose she went?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I thought she\'d have taken a cab and have been here by this time.\r\nBut she\'ll turn up all right."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I HOPE she will," Maisie said; she spoke with an earnestness\r\nbegotten of the impression of all the beauty about them, to which, in\r\nperson, the Countess might make further contribution. "We came awfully\r\nfast," she added.\r\n\r\nHer father again laughed loud. "Yes, my dear, I made you step out!" He\r\nwaited an instant, then pursued: "I want her to see you."\r\n\r\nMaisie, at this, rejoiced in the attention that, for their evening out,\r\nMrs. Beale, even to the extent of personally "doing up" her old hat, had\r\ngiven her appearance. Meanwhile her father went on: "You\'ll like her\r\nawfully."\r\n\r\n"Oh I\'m sure I shall!" After which, either from the effect of having\r\nsaid so much or from that of a sudden glimpse of the impossibility of\r\nsaying more, she felt an embarrassment and sought refuge in a minor\r\nbranch of the subject. "I thought she was Mrs. Cuddon."\r\n\r\nBeale\'s gaiety rather increased than diminished. "You mean my wife\r\ndid? My dear child, my wife\'s a damned fool!" He had the oddest air of\r\nspeaking of his wife as of a person whom she might scarcely have known,\r\nso that the refuge of her scruple didn\'t prove particularly happy. Beale\r\non the other hand appeared after an instant himself to feel a scruple.\r\n"What I mean is, to speak seriously, that she doesn\'t really know\r\nanything about anything." He paused, following the child\'s charmed eyes\r\nand tentative step or two as they brought her nearer to the pretty\r\nthings on one of the tables. "She thinks she has good things, don\'t you\r\nknow!" He quite jeered at Mrs. Beale\'s delusion.\r\n\r\nMaisie felt she must confess that it WAS one; everything she had missed\r\nat the side-shows was made up to her by the Countess\'s luxuries. "Yes,"\r\nshe considered; "she does think that."\r\n\r\nThere was again a dryness in the way Beale replied that it didn\'t matter\r\nwhat she thought; but there was an increasing sweetness for his daughter\r\nin being with him so long without his doing anything worse. The whole\r\nhour of course was to remain with her, for days and weeks, ineffaceably\r\nillumined and confirmed; by the end of which she was able to read\r\ninto it a hundred things that had been at the moment mere miraculous\r\npleasantness. What they at the moment came to was simply that her\r\ncompanion was still in a good deal of a flutter, yet wished not to show\r\nit, and that just in proportion as he succeeded in this attempt he was\r\nable to encourage her to regard him as kind. He moved about the room\r\nafter a little, showed her things, spoke to her as a person of taste,\r\ntold her the name, which she remembered, of the famous French lady\r\nrepresented in one of the miniatures, and remarked, as if he had caught\r\nher wistful over a trinket or a trailing stuff, that he made no doubt\r\nthe Countess, on coming in, would give her something jolly. He spied a\r\npink satin box with a looking-glass let into the cover, which he raised,\r\nwith a quick facetious flourish, to offer her the privilege of six rows\r\nof chocolate bonbons, cutting out thereby Sir Claude, who had never\r\ngone beyond four rows. "I can do what I like with these," he said, "for\r\nI don\'t mind telling you I gave \'em to her myself." The Countess had\r\nevidently appreciated the gift; there were numerous gaps, a ravage now\r\nquite unchecked, in the array. Even while they waited together Maisie\r\nhad her sense, which was the mark of what their separation had become,\r\nof her having grown for him, since the last time he had, as it were,\r\nnoticed her, and by increase of years and of inches if by nothing else,\r\nmuch more of a little person to reckon with. Yes, this was a part of\r\nthe positive awkwardness that he carried off by being almost foolishly\r\ntender. There was a passage during which, on a yellow silk sofa under\r\none of the palms, he had her on his knee, stroking her hair, playfully\r\nholding her off while he showed his shining fangs and let her, with\r\na vague affectionate helpless pointless "Dear old girl, dear little\r\ndaughter," inhale the fragrance of his cherished beard. She must have\r\nbeen sorry for him, she afterwards knew, so well could she privately\r\nfollow his difficulty in being specific to her about anything. She had\r\nsuch possibilities of vibration, of response, that it needed nothing\r\nmore than this to make up to her in fact for omissions. The tears came\r\ninto her eyes again as they had done when in the Park that day the\r\nCaptain told her so "splendidly" that her mother was good. What was\r\nthis but splendid too--this still directer goodness of her father and\r\nthis unexampled shining solitude with him, out of which everything had\r\ndropped but that he was papa and that he was magnificent? It didn\'t\r\nspoil it that she finally felt he must have, as he became restless, some\r\npurpose he didn\'t quite see his way to bring out, for in the freshness\r\nof their recovered fellowship she would have lent herself gleefully to\r\nhis suggesting, or even to his pretending, that their relations were\r\neasy and graceful. There was something in him that seemed, and quite\r\ntouchingly, to ask her to help him to pretend--pretend he knew enough\r\nabout her life and her education, her means of subsistence and her view\r\nof himself, to give the questions he couldn\'t put her a natural domestic\r\ntone. She would have pretended with ecstasy if he could only have given\r\nher the cue. She waited for it while, between his big teeth, he breathed\r\nthe sighs she didn\'t know to be stupid. And as if, though he was so\r\nstupid all through, he had let the friendly suffusion of her eyes yet\r\ntell him she was ready for anything, he floundered about, wondering what\r\nthe devil he could lay hold of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had lighted a cigarette and begun to smoke in her face it was as\r\nif he had struck with the match the note of some queer clumsy ferment\r\nof old professions, old scandals, old duties, a dim perception of what\r\nhe possessed in her and what, if everything had only--damn it!--been\r\ntotally different, she might still be able to give him. What she was\r\nable to give him, however, as his blinking eyes seemed to make out\r\nthrough the smoke, would be simply what he should be able to get from\r\nher. To give something, to give here on the spot, was all her own\r\ndesire. Among the old things that came back was her little instinct of\r\nkeeping the peace; it made her wonder more sharply what particular thing\r\nshe could do or not do, what particular word she could speak or not\r\nspeak, what particular line she could take or not take, that might for\r\nevery one, even for the Countess, give a better turn to the crisis. She\r\nwas ready, in this interest, for an immense surrender, a surrender of\r\neverything but Sir Claude, of everything but Mrs. Beale. The immensity\r\ndidn\'t include THEM; but if he had an idea at the back of his head\r\nshe had also one in a recess as deep, and for a time, while they sat\r\ntogether, there was an extraordinary mute passage between her vision\r\nof this vision of his, his vision of her vision, and her vision of his\r\nvision of her vision. What there was no effective record of indeed\r\nwas the small strange pathos on the child\'s part of an innocence so\r\nsaturated with knowledge and so directed to diplomacy. What, further,\r\nBeale finally laid hold of while he masked again with his fine presence\r\nhalf the flounces of the fireplace was: "Do you know, my dear, I shall\r\nsoon be off to America?" It struck his daughter both as a short cut and\r\nas the way he wouldn\'t have said it to his wife. But his wife figured\r\nwith a bright superficial assurance in her response.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean with Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\nHer father looked at her hard. "Don\'t be a little ass!"\r\n\r\nHer silence appeared to represent a concentrated effort not to be. "Then\r\nwith the Countess?"\r\n\r\n"With her or without her, my dear; that concerns only your poor daddy.\r\nShe has big interests over there, and she wants me to take a look at\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nMaisie threw herself into them. "Will that take very long?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; they\'re in such a muddle--it may take months. Now what I want to\r\nhear, you know, is whether you\'d like to come along?"\r\n\r\nPlanted once more before him in the middle of the room she felt herself\r\nturning white. "I?" she gasped, yet feeling as soon as she had spoken\r\nthat such a note of dismay was not altogether pretty. She felt it still\r\nmore while her father replied, with a shake of his legs, a toss of his\r\ncigarette-ash and a fidgety look--he was for ever taking one--all the\r\nlength of his waistcoat and trousers, that she needn\'t be quite so\r\ndisgusted. It helped her in a few seconds to appear more as he would\r\nlike her that she saw, in the lovely light of the Countess\'s splendour,\r\nexactly, however she appeared, the right answer to make. "Dear papa,\r\nI\'ll go with you anywhere."\r\n\r\nHe turned his back to her and stood with his nose at the glass of the\r\nchimneypiece while he brushed specks of ash out of his beard. Then he\r\nabruptly said: "Do you know anything about your brute of a mother?"\r\n\r\nIt was just of her brute of a mother that the manner of the question in\r\na remarkable degree reminded her: it had the free flight of one of Ida\'s\r\nfine bridgings of space. With the sense of this was kindled for Maisie\r\nat the same time an inspiration. "Oh yes, I know everything!" and she\r\nbecame so radiant that her father, seeing it in the mirror, turned back\r\nto her and presently, on the sofa, had her at his knee again and was\r\nagain particularly affecting. Maisie\'s inspiration instructed her,\r\npressingly, that the more she should be able to say about mamma the\r\nless she would be called upon to speak of her step-parents. She kept\r\nhoping the Countess would come in before her power to protect them was\r\nexhausted; and it was now, in closer quarters with her companion, that\r\nthe idea at the back of her head shifted its place to her lips. She told\r\nhim she had met her mother in the Park with a gentleman who, while Sir\r\nClaude had strolled with her ladyship, had been kind and had sat and\r\ntalked to her; narrating the scene with a remembrance of her pledge of\r\nsecrecy to the Captain quite brushed away by the joy of seeing Beale\r\nlisten without profane interruption. It was almost an amazement, but it\r\nwas indeed all a joy, thus to be able to guess that papa was at last\r\nquite tired of his anger--of his anger at any rate about mamma. He was\r\nonly bored with her now. That made it, however, the more imperative that\r\nhis spent displeasure shouldn\'t be blown out again. It charmed the child\r\nto see how much she could interest him; and the charm remained even\r\nwhen, after asking her a dozen questions, he observed musingly and a\r\nlittle obscurely: "Yes, damned if she won\'t!" For in this too there was\r\na detachment, a wise weariness that made her feel safe. She had had\r\nto mention Sir Claude, though she mentioned him as little as possible\r\nand Beale only appeared to look quite over his head. It pieced itself\r\ntogether for her that this was the mildness of general indifference, a\r\nsource of profit so great for herself personally that if the Countess\r\nwas the author of it she was prepared literally to hug the Countess. She\r\nbetrayed that eagerness by a restless question about her, to which her\r\nfather replied: "Oh she has a head on her shoulders. I\'ll back her to\r\nget out of anything!" He looked at Maisie quite as if he could trace the\r\nconnexion between her enquiry and the impatience of her gratitude. "Do\r\nyou mean to say you\'d really come with me?"\r\n\r\nShe felt as if he were now looking at her very hard indeed, and also as\r\nif she had grown ever so much older. "I\'ll do anything in the world you\r\nask me, papa."\r\n\r\nHe gave again, with a laugh and with his legs apart, his proprietary\r\nglance at his waistcoat and trousers. "That\'s a way, my dear, of saying\r\n\'No, thank you!\' You know you don\'t want to go the least little mite.\r\nYou can\'t humbug ME!" Beale Farange laid down. "I don\'t want to bully\r\nyou--I never bullied you in my life; but I make you the offer, and it\'s\r\nto take or to leave. Your mother will never again have any more to do\r\nwith you than if you were a kitchenmaid she had turned out for going\r\nwrong. Therefore of course I\'m your natural protector and you\'ve a right\r\nto get everything out of me you can. Now\'s your chance, you know--you\r\nwon\'t be half-clever if you don\'t. You can\'t say I don\'t put it before\r\nyou--you can\'t say I ain\'t kind to you or that I don\'t play fair. Mind\r\nyou never say that, you know--it WOULD bring me down on you. I know\r\nwhat\'s proper. I\'ll take you again, just as I HAVE taken you again and\r\nagain. And I\'m much obliged to you for making up such a face."\r\n\r\nShe was conscious enough that her face indeed couldn\'t please him if it\r\nshowed any sign--just as she hoped it didn\'t--of her sharp impression of\r\nwhat he now really wanted to do. Wasn\'t he trying to turn the tables on\r\nher, embarrass her somehow into admitting that what would really suit\r\nher little book would be, after doing so much for good manners, to leave\r\nher wholly at liberty to arrange for herself? She began to be nervous\r\nagain: it rolled over her that this was their parting, their parting\r\nfor ever, and that he had brought her there for so many caresses only\r\nbecause it was important such an occasion should look better for him\r\nthan any other. For her to spoil it by the note of discord would\r\ncertainly give him ground for complaint; and the child was momentarily\r\nbewildered between her alternatives of agreeing with him about her\r\nwanting to get rid of him and displeasing him by pretending to stick\r\nto him. So she found for the moment no solution but to murmur very\r\nhelplessly: "Oh papa--oh papa!"\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'re up to--don\'t tell ME!" After which he came straight\r\nover and, in the most inconsequent way in the world, clasped her in\r\nhis arms a moment and rubbed his beard against her cheek. Then she\r\nunderstood as well as if he had spoken it that what he wanted, hang\r\nit, was that she should let him off with all the honours--with all\r\nthe appearance of virtue and sacrifice on his side. It was exactly as\r\nif he had broken out to her: "I say, you little booby, help me to be\r\nirreproachable, to be noble, and yet to have none of the beastly bore of\r\nit. There\'s only impropriety enough for one of us; so YOU must take it\r\nall. REPUDIATE your dear old daddy--in the face, mind you, of his tender\r\nsupplications. He can\'t be rough with you--it isn\'t in his nature:\r\ntherefore you\'ll have successfully chucked him because he was too\r\ngenerous to be as firm with you, poor man, as was, after all, his duty."\r\nThis was what he communicated in a series of tremendous pats on the\r\nback; that portion of her person had never been so thumped since Moddle\r\nthumped her when she choked. After a moment he gave her the further\r\nimpression of having become sure enough of her to be able very\r\ngracefully to say out: "You know your mother loathes you, loathes you\r\nsimply. And I\'ve been thinking over your precious man--the fellow you\r\ntold me about."\r\n\r\n"Well," Maisie replied with competence, "I\'m sure of HIM."\r\n\r\nHer father was vague for an instant. "Do you mean sure of his liking\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; of his liking HER!"\r\n\r\nBeale had a return of gaiety. "There\'s no accounting for tastes! It\'s\r\nwhat they all say, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care--I\'m sure of him!" Maisie repeated.\r\n\r\n"Sure, you mean, that she\'ll bolt?"\r\n\r\nMaisie knew all about bolting, but, decidedly, she WAS older, and there\r\nwas something in her that could wince at the way her father made the\r\nugly word--ugly enough at best--sound flat and low. It prompted her to\r\namend his allusion, which she did by saying: "I don\'t know what she\'ll\r\ndo. But she\'ll be happy."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope so," said Beale--almost as for edification. "The more happy\r\nshe is at any rate the less she\'ll want you about. That\'s why I press\r\nyou," he agreeably pursued, "to consider this handsome offer--I mean\r\nseriously, you know--of your sole surviving parent." Their eyes, at\r\nthis, met again in a long and extraordinary communion which terminated\r\nin his ejaculating: "Ah you little scoundrel!" She took it from him in\r\nthe manner it seemed to her he would like best and with a success that\r\nencouraged him to go on: "You ARE a deep little devil!" Her silence,\r\nticking like a watch, acknowledged even this, in confirmation of which\r\nhe finally brought out: "You\'ve settled it with the other pair!"\r\n\r\n"Well, what if I have?" She sounded to herself most bold.\r\n\r\nHer father, quite as in the old days, broke into a peal. "Why, don\'t you\r\nknow they\'re awful?"\r\n\r\nShe grew bolder still. "I don\'t care--not a bit!"\r\n\r\n"But they\'re probably the worst people in the world and the very\r\ngreatest criminals," Beale pleasantly urged. "I\'m not the man, my dear,\r\nnot to let you know it."\r\n\r\n"Well, it doesn\'t prevent them from loving me. They love me\r\ntremendously." Maisie turned crimson to hear herself.\r\n\r\nHer companion fumbled; almost any one--let alone a daughter--would\r\nhave seen how conscientious he wanted to be. "I dare say. But do you\r\nknow why?" She braved his eyes and he added: "You\'re a jolly good\r\npretext."\r\n\r\n"For what?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, for their game. I needn\'t tell you what that is."\r\n\r\nThe child reflected. "Well then that\'s all the more reason."\r\n\r\n"Reason for what, pray?"\r\n\r\n"For their being kind to me."\r\n\r\n"And for your keeping in with them?" Beale roared again; it was as if\r\nhis spirits rose and rose. "Do you realise, pray, that in saying that\r\nyou\'re a monster?"\r\n\r\nShe turned it over. "A monster?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve MADE one of you. Upon my honour it\'s quite awful. It shows\r\nthe kind of people they are. Don\'t you understand," Beale pursued,\r\n"that when they\'ve made you as horrid as they can--as horrid as\r\nthemselves--they\'ll just simply chuck you?"\r\n\r\nShe had at this a flicker of passion. "They WON\'T chuck me!"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," her father courteously insisted; "it\'s my duty to\r\nput it before you. I shouldn\'t forgive myself if I didn\'t point out to\r\nyou that they\'ll cease to require you." He spoke as if with an appeal to\r\nher intelligence that she must be ashamed not adequately to meet, and\r\nthis gave a real distinction to his superior delicacy.\r\n\r\nIt cleared the case as he had wished. "Cease to require me because they\r\nwon\'t care?" She paused with that sketch of her idea.\r\n\r\n"OF COURSE Sir Claude won\'t care if his wife bolts. That\'s his game. It\r\nwill suit him down to the ground."\r\n\r\nThis was a proposition Maisie could perfectly embrace, but it still left\r\na loophole for triumph. She turned it well over. "You mean if mamma\r\ndoesn\'t come back ever at all?" The composure with which her face was\r\npresented to that prospect would have shown a spectator the long road\r\nshe had travelled. "Well, but that won\'t put Mrs. Beale--"\r\n\r\n"In the same comfortable position--?" Beale took her up with relish; he\r\nhad sprung to his feet again, shaking his legs and looking at his shoes.\r\n"Right you are, darling! Something more will be wanted for Mrs. Beale."\r\nHe just paused, then he added: "But she may not have long to wait for\r\nit."\r\n\r\nMaisie also for a minute looked at his shoes, though they were not the\r\npair she most admired, the laced yellow "uppers" and patent-leather\r\ncomplement. At last, with a question, she raised her eyes. "Aren\'t you\r\ncoming back?"\r\n\r\nOnce more he hung fire; after which he gave a small laugh that in the\r\noddest way in the world reminded her of the unique sounds she had\r\nheard emitted by Mrs. Wix. "It may strike you as extraordinary that I\r\nshould make you such an admission; and in point of fact you\'re not to\r\nunderstand that I do. But we\'ll put it that way to help your decision.\r\nThe point is that that\'s the way my wife will presently be sure to put\r\nit. You\'ll hear her shrieking that she\'s deserted, so that she may just\r\npile up her wrongs. She\'ll be as free as she likes then--as free, you\r\nsee, as your mother\'s muff of a husband. They won\'t have anything more\r\nto consider and they\'ll just put you into the street. Do I understand,"\r\nBeale enquired, "that, in the face of what I press on you, you still\r\nprefer to take the risk of that?" It was the most wonderful appeal any\r\ngentleman had ever addressed to his daughter, and it had placed Maisie\r\nin the middle of the room again while her father moved slowly about her\r\nwith his hands in his pockets and something in his step that seemed,\r\nmore than anything else he had done, to show the habit of the place.\r\nShe turned her fevered little eyes over his friend\'s brightnesses, as\r\nif, on her own side, to press for some help in a quandary unexampled.\r\nAs if also the pressure reached him he after an instant stopped short,\r\ncompleting the prodigy of his attitude and the pride of his loyalty by\r\na supreme formulation of the general inducement. "You\'ve an eye, love!\r\nYes, there\'s money. No end of money."\r\n\r\nThis affected her at first in the manner of some great flashing dazzle\r\nin one of the pantomimes to which Sir Claude had taken her: she saw\r\nnothing in it but what it directly conveyed. "And shall I never, never\r\nsee you again--?"\r\n\r\n"If I do go to America?" Beale brought it out like a man. "Never, never,\r\nnever!"\r\n\r\nHereupon, with the utmost absurdity, she broke down; everything gave\r\nway, everything but the horror of hearing herself definitely utter such\r\nan ugliness as the acceptance of that. So she only stiffened herself and\r\nsaid: "Then I can\'t give you up."\r\n\r\nShe held him some seconds looking at her, showing her a strained\r\ngrimace, a perfect parade of all his teeth, in which it seemed to her\r\nshe could read the disgust he didn\'t quite like to express at this\r\ndeparture from the pliability she had practically promised. But before\r\nshe could attenuate in any way the crudity of her collapse he gave an\r\nimpatient jerk which took him to the window. She heard a vehicle stop;\r\nBeale looked out; then he freshly faced her. He still said nothing, but\r\nshe knew the Countess had come back. There was a silence again between\r\nthem, but with a different shade of embarrassment from that of their\r\nunited arrival; and it was still without speaking that, abruptly\r\nrepeating one of the embraces of which he had already been so prodigal,\r\nhe whisked her back to the lemon sofa just before the door of the room\r\nwas thrown open. It was thus in renewed and intimate union with him that\r\nshe was presented to a person whom she instantly recognised as the brown\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nThe brown lady looked almost as astonished, though not quite as alarmed,\r\nas when, at the Exhibition, she had gasped in the face of Mrs. Beale.\r\nMaisie in truth almost gasped in her own; this was with the fuller\r\nperception that she was brown indeed. She literally struck the child\r\nmore as an animal than as a "real" lady; she might have been a clever\r\nfrizzled poodle in a frill or a dreadful human monkey in a spangled\r\npetticoat. She had a nose that was far too big and eyes that were far\r\ntoo small and a moustache that was, well, not so happy a feature as Sir\r\nClaude\'s. Beale jumped up to her; while, to the child\'s astonishment,\r\nthough as if in a quick intensity of thought, the Countess advanced as\r\ngaily as if, for many a day, nothing awkward had happened for any one.\r\nMaisie, in spite of a large acquaintance with the phenomenon, had\r\nnever seen it so promptly established that nothing awkward was to be\r\nmentioned. The next minute the Countess had kissed her and exclaimed to\r\nBeale with bright tender reproach: "Why, you never told me HALF! My dear\r\nchild," she cried, "it was awfully nice of you to come!"\r\n\r\n"But she hasn\'t come--she won\'t come!" Beale answered. "I\'ve put it to\r\nher how much you\'d like it, but she declines to have anything to do with\r\nus."\r\n\r\nThe Countess stood smiling, and after an instant that was mainly taken\r\nup with the shock of her weird aspect Maisie felt herself reminded\r\nof another smile, which was not ugly, though also interested--the\r\nkind light thrown, that day in the Park, from the clean fair face of\r\nthe Captain. Papa\'s Captain--yes--was the Countess; but she wasn\'t\r\nnearly so nice as the other: it all came back, doubtless, to Maisie\'s\r\nminor appreciation of ladies. "Shouldn\'t you like me," said this one\r\nendearingly, "to take you to Spa?"\r\n\r\n"To Spa?" The child repeated the name to gain time, not to show how the\r\nCountess brought back to her a dim remembrance of a strange woman with a\r\nhorrid face who once, years before, in an omnibus, bending to her from\r\nan opposite seat, had suddenly produced an orange and murmured "Little\r\ndearie, won\'t you have it?" She had felt then, for some reason, a small\r\nsilly terror, though afterwards conscious that her interlocutress,\r\nunfortunately hideous, had particularly meant to be kind. This was also\r\nwhat the Countess meant; yet the few words she had uttered and the smile\r\nwith which she had uttered them immediately cleared everything up. Oh\r\nno, she wanted to go nowhere with HER, for her presence had already, in\r\na few seconds, dissipated the happy impression of the room and put an\r\nend to the pleasure briefly taken in Beale\'s command of such elegance.\r\nThere was no command of elegance in his having exposed her to the\r\napproach of the short fat wheedling whiskered person in whom she had now\r\nto recognise the only figure wholly without attraction involved in any\r\nof the intimate connexions her immediate circle had witnessed the growth\r\nof. She was abashed meanwhile, however, at having appeared to weigh in\r\nthe balance the place to which she had been invited; and she added as\r\nquickly as possible: "It isn\'t to America then?" The Countess, at this,\r\nlooked sharply at Beale, and Beale, airily enough, asked what the deuce\r\nit mattered when she had already given him to understand she wanted to\r\nhave nothing to do with them. There followed between her companions a\r\npassage of which the sense was drowned for her in the deepening inward\r\nhum of her mere desire to get off; though she was able to guess later\r\non that her father must have put it to his friend that it was no use\r\ntalking, that she was an obstinate little pig and that, besides, she\r\nwas really old enough to choose for herself. It glimmered back to her\r\nindeed that she must have failed quite dreadfully to seem ideally other\r\nthan rude, inasmuch as before she knew it she had visibly given the\r\nimpression that if they didn\'t allow her to go home she should cry. Oh\r\nif there had ever been a thing to cry about it was being so consciously\r\nand gawkily below the handsomest offers any one could ever have\r\nreceived. The great pain of the thing was that she could see the\r\nCountess liked her enough to wish to be liked in return, and it was from\r\nthe idea of a return she sought utterly to flee. It was the idea of a\r\nreturn that after a confusion of loud words had broken out between the\r\nothers brought to her lips with the tremor preceding disaster: "Can\'t\r\nI, please, be sent home in a cab?" Yes, the Countess wanted her and the\r\nCountess was wounded and chilled, and she couldn\'t help it, and it was\r\nall the more dreadful because it only made the Countess more coaxing and\r\nmore impossible. The only thing that sustained either of them perhaps\r\ntill the cab came--Maisie presently saw it would come--was its being\r\nin the air somehow that Beale had done what he wanted. He went out to\r\nlook for a conveyance; the servants, he said, had gone to bed, but she\r\nshouldn\'t be kept beyond her time. The Countess left the room with him,\r\nand, alone in the possession of it, Maisie hoped she wouldn\'t come\r\nback. It was all the effect of her face--the child simply couldn\'t look\r\nat it and meet its expression halfway. All in a moment too that queer\r\nexpression had leaped into the lovely things--all in a moment she had\r\nhad to accept her father as liking some one whom she was sure neither\r\nher mother, nor Mrs. Beale, nor Mrs. Wix, nor Sir Claude, nor the\r\nCaptain, nor even Mr. Perriam and Lord Eric could possibly have liked.\r\nThree minutes later, downstairs, with the cab at the door, it was\r\nperhaps as a final confession of not having much to boast of that, on\r\ntaking leave of her, he managed to press her to his bosom without her\r\nseeing his face. For herself she was so eager to go that their parting\r\nreminded her of nothing, not even of a single one of all the "nevers"\r\nthat above, as the penalty of not cleaving to him, he had attached to\r\nthe question of their meeting again. There was something in the Countess\r\nthat falsified everything, even the great interests in America and yet\r\nmore the first flush of that superiority to Mrs. Beale and to mamma\r\nwhich had been expressed in S\xe8vres sets and silver boxes. These were\r\nstill there, but perhaps there were no great interests in America.\r\nMamma had known an American who was not a bit like this one. She was\r\nnot, however, of noble rank; her name was only Mrs. Tucker. Maisie\'s\r\ndetachment would none the less have been more complete if she had not\r\nsuddenly had to exclaim: "Oh dear, I haven\'t any money!"\r\n\r\nHer father\'s teeth, at this, were such a picture of appetite without\r\naction as to be a match for any plea of poverty. "Make your stepmother\r\npay."\r\n\r\n"Stepmothers DON\'T pay!" cried the Countess. "No stepmother ever paid\r\nin her life!" The next moment they were in the street together, and the\r\nnext the child was in the cab, with the Countess, on the pavement, but\r\nclose to her, quickly taking money from a purse whisked out of a pocket.\r\nHer father had vanished and there was even yet nothing in that to\r\nreawaken the pang of loss. "Here\'s money," said the brown lady: "go!"\r\nThe sound was commanding: the cab rattled off. Maisie sat there with her\r\nhand full of coin. All that for a cab? As they passed a street-lamp she\r\nbent to see how much. What she saw was a cluster of sovereigns. There\r\nMUST then have been great interests in America. It was still at any rate\r\nthe Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe money was far too much even for a fee in a fairy-tale, and in the\r\nabsence of Mrs. Beale, who, though the hour was now late, had not yet\r\nreturned to the Regent\'s Park, Susan Ash, in the hall, as loud as Maisie\r\nwas low and as bold as she was bland, produced, on the exhibition\r\noffered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a\r\ncontrast to the child\'s recent scene of light, the half-crown that an\r\nunsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take. It\r\nwas apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval\r\nMaisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like\r\na darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to\r\ndevote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular\r\none of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table\r\nupstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a\r\nhousemaid than to the subject of the manoeuvres of a quartette. This\r\nsubject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted\r\nhandkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her\r\npillow; but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more\r\ncomplete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend\r\nfound their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free. There were\r\nexplanations indeed that Mrs. Beale had to give as well as to ask, and\r\nthe most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for\r\na little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of\r\ntheir sex. The sovereigns were examined with some attention, the result\r\nof which, however, was to make the author of that statement desire to\r\nknow what, if one really went into the matter, they could be called\r\nbut the wages of sin. Her companion went into it merely so far as the\r\nquestion of what then they were to do with them; on which Mrs. Beale,\r\nwho had by this time put them into her pocket, replied with dignity\r\nand with her hand on the place: "We\'re to send them back on the spot!"\r\nSusan, the child soon afterwards learnt, had been invited to contribute\r\nto this act of restitution her one appropriated coin; but a closer\r\nclutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to Maisie that\r\nthere was a limit to the way she could be "done." Maisie had been open\r\nwith Mrs. Beale about the whole of last night\'s transaction; but she\r\nnow found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient\r\nof remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that lady\'s own\r\nsuppressions. One of these bore upon the extraordinary hour--it was\r\nthree in the morning if she really wanted to know--at which Mrs. Beale\r\nhad re-entered the house; another, in accents as to which Maisie\'s\r\ncriticism was still intensely tacit, characterised her appeal as such\r\na "gime," such a "shime," as one had never had to put up with; a\r\nthird treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due\r\nbelowstairs, in every department, for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal.\r\nOur young lady\'s consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several\r\ndays with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her\r\nattendant\'s sense of wrong. These days would become terrific like the\r\nRevolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the\r\nkitchen should crown them; and to promote that prospect she had through\r\nSusan\'s eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are\r\nprepared. To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to\r\nthe inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to\r\nhave been the circumstance of one\'s being called a horrid low thief for\r\nrefusing to part with one\'s own. The redeeming point of this tension\r\nwas, on the fifth day, that it actually appeared to have had to do with\r\na breathless perception in our heroine\'s breast that scarcely more as\r\nthe centre of Sir Claude\'s than as that of Susan\'s energies she had soon\r\nafter breakfast been conveyed from London to Folkestone and established\r\nat a lovely hotel. These agents, before her wondering eyes, had combined\r\nto carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed\r\nits success to the fact that Mrs. Beale had, as Susan said, but just\r\nstepped out. When Sir Claude, watch in hand, had met this fact with the\r\nexclamation "Then pack Miss Farange and come off with us!" there had\r\nensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring Miss\r\nFarange\'s heart into Miss Farange\'s mouth. She sat with Sir Claude in\r\na four-wheeler while he still held his watch; held it longer than any\r\ndoctor who had ever felt her pulse; long enough to give her a vision\r\nof something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to\r\nshow impatience. The ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the\r\nBerceuse, quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day, a little\r\nwhile back, when Susan had panted up and she herself, after the hint\r\nabout the duchess, had sailed down; for what harm then had there been in\r\ndrops and disappointments if she could still have, even only a moment,\r\nthe sensation of such a name "brought up"? It had remained with her that\r\nher father had foretold her she would some day be in the street, but it\r\nclearly wouldn\'t be this day, and she felt justified of the preference\r\nbetrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set Susan in motion\r\nand laid his hand, while she waited with him, kindly on her own. This\r\nwas what the Captain, in Kensington Gardens, had done; her present\r\nsituation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder\r\nof the fashion after which, from the first, such pats and pulls had\r\nstruck her as the steps and signs of other people\'s business and even a\r\nlittle as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties. What had\r\nfailed her and what had frightened her on the night of the Exhibition\r\nlost themselves at present alike in the impression that any "surprise"\r\nnow about to burst from Sir Claude would be too big to burst all at\r\nonce. Any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her\r\nstepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule, the odd truth\r\nthat if Mrs. Beale now never came nor went without making her think of\r\nhim, it was never, to balance that, the main mark of his own renewed\r\nreality to appear to be a reference to Mrs. Beale. To be with Sir Claude\r\nwas to think of Sir Claude, and that law governed Maisie\'s mind until,\r\nthrough a sudden lurch of the cab, which had at last taken in Susan and\r\never so many bundles and almost reached Charing Cross, it popped again\r\nsomehow into her dizzy head the long-lost image of Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\nIt was singular, but from this time she understood and she followed,\r\nfollowed with the sense of an ample filling-out of any void created by\r\nsymptoms of avoidance and of flight. Her ecstasy was a thing that had\r\nyet more of a face than of a back to turn, a pair of eyes still directed\r\nto Mrs. Wix even after the slight surprise of their not finding her, as\r\nthe journey expanded, either at the London station or at the Folkestone\r\nhotel. It took few hours to make the child feel that if she was in\r\nneither of these places she was at least everywhere else. Maisie had\r\nknown all along a great deal, but never so much as she was to know from\r\nthis moment on and as she learned in particular during the couple of\r\ndays that she was to hang in the air, as it were, over the sea which\r\nrepresented in breezy blueness and with a summer charm a crossing of\r\nmore spaces than the Channel. It was granted her at this time to arrive\r\nat divinations so ample that I shall have no room for the goal if I\r\nattempt to trace the stages; as to which therefore I must be content to\r\nsay that the fullest expression we may give to Sir Claude\'s conduct is\r\na poor and pale copy of the picture it presented to his young friend.\r\nAbruptly, that morning, he had yielded to the action of the idea pumped\r\ninto him for weeks by Mrs. Wix on lines of approach that she had been\r\ncapable of the extraordinary art of preserving from entanglement in\r\nthe fine network of his relations with Mrs. Beale. The breath of her\r\nsincerity, blowing without a break, had puffed him up to the flight\r\nby which, in the degree I have indicated, Maisie too was carried off\r\nher feet. This consisted neither in more nor in less than the brave\r\nstroke of his getting off from Mrs. Beale as well as from his wife--of\r\nmaking with the child straight for some such foreign land as would\r\ngive a support to Mrs. Wix\'s dream that she might still see his\r\nerrors renounced and his delinquencies redeemed. It would all be a\r\nsacrifice--under eyes that would miss no faintest shade--to what even\r\nthe strange frequenters of her ladyship\'s earlier period used to call\r\nthe real good of the little unfortunate. Maisie\'s head held a suspicion\r\nof much that, during the last long interval, had confusedly, but quite\r\ncandidly, come and gone in his own; a glimpse, almost awe-stricken in\r\nits gratitude, of the miracle her old governess had wrought. That\r\nfunctionary could not in this connexion have been more impressive, even\r\nat second-hand, if she had been a prophetess with an open scroll or some\r\nardent abbess speaking with the lips of the Church. She had clung day\r\nby day to their plastic associate, plying him with her deep, narrow\r\npassion, doing her simple utmost to convert him, and so working on him\r\nthat he had at last really embraced his fine chance. That the chance was\r\nnot delusive was sufficiently guaranteed by the completeness with which\r\nhe could finally figure it out that, in case of his taking action,\r\nneither Ida nor Beale, whose book, on each side, it would only too well\r\nsuit, would make any sort of row.\r\n\r\nIt sounds, no doubt, too penetrating, but it was not all as an effect of\r\nSir Claude\'s betrayals that Maisie was able to piece together the beauty\r\nof the special influence through which, for such stretches of time,\r\nhe had refined upon propriety by keeping, so far as possible, his\r\nsentimental interests distinct. She had ever of course in her mind fewer\r\nnames than conceptions, but it was only with this drawback that she now\r\nmade out her companion\'s absences to have had for their ground that he\r\nwas the lover of her stepmother and that the lover of her stepmother\r\ncould scarce logically pretend to a superior right to look after her.\r\nMaisie had by this time embraced the implication of a kind of natural\r\ndivergence between lovers and little girls. It was just this indeed\r\nthat could throw light on the probable contents of the pencilled note\r\ndeposited on the hall-table in the Regent\'s Park and which would greet\r\nMrs. Beale on her return. Maisie freely figured it as provisionally\r\njocular in tone, even though to herself on this occasion Sir Claude\r\nturned a graver face than he had shown in any crisis but that of putting\r\nher into the cab when she had been horrid to him after her parting with\r\nthe Captain. He might really be embarrassed, but he would be sure, to\r\nher view, to have muffled in some bravado of pleasantry the disturbance\r\nproduced at her father\'s by the removal of a valued servant. Not that\r\nthere wasn\'t a great deal too that wouldn\'t be in the note--a great deal\r\nfor which a more comfortable place was Maisie\'s light little brain,\r\nwhere it hummed away hour after hour and caused the first outlook at\r\nFolkestone to swim in a softness of colour and sound. It became clear in\r\nthis medium that her stepfather had really now only to take into account\r\nhis entanglement with Mrs. Beale. Wasn\'t he at last disentangled from\r\nevery one and every thing else? The obstacle to the rupture pressed upon\r\nhim by Mrs. Wix in the interest of his virtue would be simply that he\r\nwas in love, or rather, to put it more precisely, that Mrs. Beale had\r\nleft him no doubt of the degree in which SHE was. She was so much so as\r\nto have succeeded in making him accept for a time her infatuated grasp\r\nof him and even to some extent the idea of what they yet might do\r\ntogether with a little diplomacy and a good deal of patience. I may not\r\neven answer for it that Maisie was not aware of how, in this, Mrs. Beale\r\nfailed to share his all but insurmountable distaste for their allowing\r\ntheir little charge to breathe the air of their gross irregularity--his\r\ncontention, in a word, that they should either cease to be irregular\r\nor cease to be parental. Their little charge, for herself, had long\r\nago adopted the view that even Mrs. Wix had at one time not thought\r\nprohibitively coarse--the view that she was after all, AS a little\r\ncharge, morally at home in atmospheres it would be appalling to analyse.\r\nIf Mrs. Wix, however, ultimately appalled, had now set her heart on\r\nstrong measures, Maisie, as I have intimated, could also work round both\r\nto the reasons for them and to the quite other reasons for that lady\'s\r\nnot, as yet at least, appearing in them at first-hand.\r\n\r\nOh decidedly I shall never get you to believe the number of things she\r\nsaw and the number of secrets she discovered! Why in the world, for\r\ninstance, couldn\'t Sir Claude have kept it from her--except on the\r\nhypothesis of his not caring to--that, when you came to look at it and\r\nso far as it was a question of vested interests, he had quite as much\r\nright in her as her stepmother, not to say a right that Mrs. Beale\r\nwas in no position to dispute? He failed at all events of any such\r\nsuccessful ambiguity as could keep her, when once they began to look\r\nacross at France, from regarding even what was least explained as most\r\nin the spirit of their old happy times, their rambles and expeditions in\r\nthe easier better days of their first acquaintance. Never before had she\r\nhad so the sense of giving him a lead for the sort of treatment of what\r\nwas between them that would best carry it off, or of his being grateful\r\nto her for meeting him so much in the right place. She met him literally\r\nat the very point where Mrs. Beale was most to be reckoned with, the\r\npoint of the jealousy that was sharp in that lady and of the need of\r\ntheir keeping it as long as possible obscure to her that poor Mrs. Wix\r\nhad still a hand. Yes, she met him too in the truth of the matter that,\r\nas her stepmother had had no one else to be jealous of, she had made\r\nup for so gross a privation by directing the sentiment to a moral\r\ninfluence. Sir Claude appeared absolutely to convey in a wink that\r\na moral influence capable of pulling a string was after all a moral\r\ninfluence exposed to the scratching out of its eyes; and that, this\r\nbeing the case, there was somebody they couldn\'t afford to leave\r\nunprotected before they should see a little better what Mrs. Beale was\r\nlikely to do. Maisie, true enough, had not to put it into words to\r\nrejoin, in the coffee-room, at luncheon: "What CAN she do but come to\r\nyou if papa does take a step that will amount to legal desertion?"\r\nNeither had he then, in answer, to articulate anything but the jollity\r\nof their having found a table at a window from which, as they partook of\r\ncold beef and apollinaris--for he hinted they would have to save lots\r\nof money--they could let their eyes hover tenderly on the far-off white\r\ncliffs that so often had signalled to the embarrassed English a promise\r\nof safety. Maisie stared at them as if she might really make out after a\r\nlittle a queer dear figure perched on them--a figure as to which she had\r\nalready the subtle sense that, wherever perched, it would be the very\r\noddest yet seen in France. But it was at least as exciting to feel where\r\nMrs. Wix wasn\'t as it would have been to know where she was, and if she\r\nwasn\'t yet at Boulogne this only thickened the plot.\r\n\r\nIf she was not to be seen that day, however, the evening was marked by\r\nan apparition before which, none the less, overstrained suspense folded\r\non the spot its wings. Adjusting her respirations and attaching, under\r\ndropped lashes, all her thoughts to a smartness of frock and frill for\r\nwhich she could reflect that she had not appealed in vain to a loyalty\r\nin Susan Ash triumphant over the nice things their feverish flight had\r\nleft behind, Maisie spent on a bench in the garden of the hotel the\r\nhalf-hour before dinner, that mysterious ceremony of the _table d\'h\xf4te_\r\nfor which she had prepared with a punctuality of flutter. Sir Claude,\r\nbeside her, was occupied with a cigarette and the afternoon papers; and\r\nthough the hotel was full the garden shewed the particular void that\r\nensues upon the sound of the dressing-bell. She had almost had time to\r\nweary of the human scene; her own humanity at any rate, in the shape of\r\na smutch on her scanty skirt, had held her so long that as soon as she\r\nraised her eyes they rested on a high fair drapery by which smutches\r\nwere put to shame and which had glided toward her over the grass without\r\nher noting its rustle. She followed up its stiff sheen--up and up from\r\nthe ground, where it had stopped--till at the end of a considerable\r\njourney her impression felt the shock of the fixed face which,\r\nsurmounting it, seemed to offer the climax of the dressed condition.\r\n"Why mamma!" she cried the next instant--cried in a tone that, as\r\nshe sprang to her feet, brought Sir Claude to his own beside her and\r\ngave her ladyship, a few yards off, the advantage of their momentary\r\nconfusion. Poor Maisie\'s was immense; her mother\'s drop had the effect\r\nof one of the iron shutters that, in evening walks with Susan Ash, she\r\nhad seen suddenly, at the touch of a spring, rattle down over shining\r\nshop-fronts. The light of foreign travel was darkened at a stroke; she\r\nhad a horrible sense that they were caught; and for the first time of\r\nher life in Ida\'s presence she so far translated an impulse into an\r\ninvidious act as to clutch straight at the hand of her responsible\r\nconfederate. It didn\'t help her that he appeared at first equally hushed\r\nwith horror; a minute during which, in the empty garden, with its long\r\nshadows on the lawn, its blue sea over the hedge and its startled peace\r\nin the air, both her elders remained as stiff as tall tumblers filled to\r\nthe brim and held straight for fear of a spill.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a tone that enriched the whole surprise by its unexpected\r\nsoftness, her mother said to Sir Claude: "Do you mind at all my speaking\r\nto her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; DO you?" His reply was so long in coming that Maisie was the\r\nfirst to find the right note.\r\n\r\nHe laughed as he seemed to take it from her, and she felt a sufficient\r\nconcession in his manner of addressing their visitor. "How in the world\r\ndid you know we were here?"\r\n\r\nHis wife, at this, came the rest of the way and sat down on the bench\r\nwith a hand laid on her daughter, whom she gracefully drew to her and in\r\nwhom, at her touch, the fear just kindled gave a second jump, but now in\r\nquite another direction. Sir Claude, on the further side, resumed his\r\nseat and his newspapers, so that the three grouped themselves like a\r\nfamily party; his connexion, in the oddest way in the world, almost\r\ncynically and in a flash acknowledged, and the mother patting the child\r\ninto conformities unspeakable. Maisie could already feel how little it\r\nwas Sir Claude and she who were caught. She had the positive sense of\r\ntheir catching their relative, catching her in the act of getting rid of\r\nher burden with a finality that showed her as unprecedentedly relaxed.\r\nOh yes, the fear had dropped, and she had never been so irrevocably\r\nparted with as in the pressure of possession now supremely exerted\r\nby Ida\'s long-gloved and much-bangled arm. "I went to the Regent\'s\r\nPark"--this was presently her ladyship\'s answer to Sir Claude.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to-day?"\r\n\r\n"This morning, just after your own call there. That\'s how I found you\r\nout; that\'s what has brought me."\r\n\r\nSir Claude considered and Maisie waited. "Whom then did you see?"\r\n\r\nIda gave a sound of indulgent mockery. "I like your scare. I know your\r\ngame. I didn\'t see the person I risked seeing, but I had been ready\r\nto take my chance of her." She addressed herself to Maisie; she had\r\nencircled her more closely. "I asked for YOU, my dear, but I saw no one\r\nbut a dirty parlourmaid. She was red in the face with the great things\r\nthat, as she told me, had just happened in the absence of her mistress;\r\nand she luckily had the sense to have made out the place to which Sir\r\nClaude had come to take you. If he hadn\'t given a false scent I should\r\nfind you here: that was the supposition on which I\'ve proceeded." Ida\r\nhad never been so explicit about proceeding or supposing, and Maisie,\r\ndrinking this in, noted too how Sir Claude shared her fine impression of\r\nit. "I wanted to see you," his wife continued, "and now you can judge of\r\nthe trouble I\'ve taken. I had everything to do in town to-day, but I\r\nmanaged to get off."\r\n\r\nMaisie and her companion, for a moment, did justice to this achievement;\r\nbut Maisie was the first to express it. "I\'m glad you wanted to see me,\r\nmamma." Then after a concentration more deep and with a plunge more\r\nbrave: "A little more and you\'d have been too late." It stuck in her\r\nthroat, but she brought it out: "We\'re going to France."\r\n\r\nIda was magnificent; Ida kissed her on the forehead. "That\'s just what I\r\nthought likely; it made me decide to run down. I fancied that in spite\r\nof your scramble you\'d wait to cross, and it added to the reason I have\r\nfor seeing you."\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered intensely what the reason could be, but she knew ever so\r\nmuch better than to ask. She was slightly surprised indeed to perceive\r\nthat Sir Claude didn\'t, and to hear him immediately enquire: "What in\r\nthe name of goodness can you have to say to her?"\r\n\r\nHis tone was not exactly rude, but it was impatient enough to make his\r\nwife\'s response a fresh specimen of the new softness. "That, my dear\r\nman, is all my own business."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," Sir Claude asked, "that you wish me to leave you with\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you\'ll be so good; that\'s the extraordinary request I take the\r\nliberty of making." Her ladyship had dropped to a mildness of irony by\r\nwhich, for a moment, poor Maisie was mystified and charmed, puzzled\r\nwith a glimpse of something that in all the years had at intervals\r\npeeped out. Ida smiled at Sir Claude with the strange air she had on\r\nsuch occasions of defying an interlocutor to keep it up as long; her\r\nhuge eyes, her red lips, the intense marks in her face formed an\r\n_\xe9clairage_ as distinct and public as a lamp set in a window. The\r\nchild seemed quite to see in it the very beacon that had lighted her\r\npath; she suddenly found herself reflecting that it was no wonder the\r\ngentlemen were guided. This must have been the way mamma had first\r\nlooked at Sir Claude; it brought back the lustre of the time they had\r\noutlived. It must have been the way she looked also at Mr. Perriam and\r\nLord Eric; above all it contributed in Maisie\'s mind to a completer\r\nview of that satisfied state of the Captain. Our young lady grasped\r\nthis idea with a quick lifting of the heart; there was a stillness\r\nduring which her mother flooded her with a wealth of support to the\r\nCaptain\'s striking tribute. This stillness remained long enough\r\nunbroken to represent that Sir Claude too might but be gasping again\r\nunder the spell originally strong for him; so that Maisie quite hoped\r\nhe would at least say something to show a recognition of how charming\r\nshe could be.\r\n\r\nWhat he presently said was: "Are you putting up for the night?"\r\n\r\nHis wife cast grandly about. "Not here--I\'ve come from Dover."\r\n\r\nOver Maisie\'s head, at this, they still faced each other. "You spend the\r\nnight there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I brought some things. I went to the hotel and hastily arranged;\r\nthen I caught the train that whisked me on here. You see what a day I\'ve\r\nhad of it."\r\n\r\nThe statement may surprise, but these were really as obliging if not as\r\nlucid words as, into her daughter\'s ears at least, Ida\'s lips had ever\r\ndropped; and there was a quick desire in the daughter that for the hour\r\nat any rate they should duly be welcomed as a ground of intercourse.\r\nCertainly mamma had a charm which, when turned on, became a large\r\nexplanation; and the only danger now in an impulse to applaud it would\r\nbe that of appearing to signalise its rarity. Maisie, however, risked\r\nthe peril in the geniality of an admission that Ida had indeed had a\r\nrush; and she invited Sir Claude to expose himself by agreeing with her\r\nthat the rush had been even worse than theirs. He appeared to meet this\r\nappeal by saying with detachment enough: "You go back there to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--there are plenty of trains." Again Sir Claude hesitated; it\r\nwould have been hard to say if the child, between them, more connected\r\nor divided them. Then he brought out quietly: "It will be late for you\r\nto knock about. I\'ll see you over."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t trouble, thank you. I think you won\'t deny that I can help\r\nmyself and that it isn\'t the first time in my dreadful life that I\'ve\r\nsomehow managed it." Save for this allusion to her dreadful life they\r\ntalked there, Maisie noted, as if they were only rather superficial\r\nfriends; a special effect that she had often wondered at before in the\r\nmidst of what she supposed to be intimacies. This effect was augmented\r\nby the almost casual manner in which her ladyship went on: "I dare say\r\nI shall go abroad."\r\n\r\n"From Dover do you mean, straight?"\r\n\r\n"How straight I can\'t say. I\'m excessively ill."\r\n\r\nThis for a minute struck Maisie as but a part of the conversation;\r\nat the end of which time she became aware that it ought to strike\r\nher--though it apparently didn\'t strike Sir Claude--as a part of\r\nsomething graver. It helped her to twist nearer. "Ill, mamma--really\r\nill?"\r\n\r\nShe regretted her "really" as soon as she had spoken it; but there\r\ncouldn\'t be a better proof of her mother\'s present polish than that Ida\r\nshowed no gleam of a temper to take it up. She had taken up at other\r\ntimes much tinier things. She only pressed Maisie\'s head against her\r\nbosom and said: "Shockingly, my dear. I must go to that new place."\r\n\r\n"What new place?" Sir Claude enquired.\r\n\r\nIda thought, but couldn\'t recall it. "Oh \'Chose,\' don\'t you know?\r\n--where every one goes. I want some proper treatment. It\'s all I\'ve ever\r\nasked for on earth. But that\'s not what I came to say."\r\n\r\nSir Claude, in silence, folded one by one his newspapers; then he rose\r\nand stood whacking the palm of his hand with the bundle. "You\'ll stop\r\nand dine with us?"\r\n\r\n"Dear no--I can\'t dine at this sort of hour. I ordered dinner at Dover."\r\n\r\nHer ladyship\'s tone in this one instance showed a certain superiority to\r\nthose conditions in which her daughter had artlessly found Folkestone a\r\nparadise. It was yet not so crushing as to nip in the bud the eagerness\r\nwith which the latter broke out: "But won\'t you at least have a cup of\r\ntea?"\r\n\r\nIda kissed her again on the brow. "Thanks, love. I had tea before\r\ncoming." She raised her eyes to Sir Claude. "She IS sweet!" He made no\r\nmore answer than if he didn\'t agree; but Maisie was at ease about that\r\nand was still taken up with the joy of this happier pitch of their talk,\r\nwhich put more and more of a meaning into the Captain\'s version of her\r\nladyship and literally kindled a conjecture that such an admirer might,\r\nover there at the other place, be waiting for her to dine. Was the same\r\nconjecture in Sir Claude\'s mind? He partly puzzled her, if it had risen\r\nthere, by the slight perversity with which he returned to a question\r\nthat his wife evidently thought she had disposed of.\r\n\r\nHe whacked his hand again with his paper. "I had really much better take\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And leave Maisie here alone?"\r\n\r\nMamma so clearly didn\'t want it that Maisie leaped at the vision of a\r\nCaptain who had seen her on from Dover and who, while he waited to take\r\nher back, would be hovering just at the same distance at which, in\r\nKensington Gardens, the companion of his walk had herself hovered. Of\r\ncourse, however, instead of breathing any such guess she let Sir Claude\r\nreply; all the more that his reply could contribute so much to her own\r\npresent grandeur. "She won\'t be alone when she has a maid in\r\nattendance."\r\n\r\nMaisie had never before had so much of a retinue, and she waited also to\r\nenjoy the action of it on her ladyship. "You mean the woman you brought\r\nfrom town?" Ida considered. "The person at the house spoke of her in a\r\nway that scarcely made her out company for my child." Her tone was that\r\nher child had never wanted, in her hands, for prodigious company. But\r\nshe as distinctly continued to decline Sir Claude\'s. "Don\'t be an old\r\ngoose," she said charmingly. "Let us alone."\r\n\r\nIn front of them on the grass he looked graver than Maisie at all now\r\nthought the occasion warranted. "I don\'t see why you can\'t say it before\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHis wife smoothed one of her daughter\'s curls. "Say what, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Why what you came to say."\r\n\r\nAt this Maisie at last interposed: she appealed to Sir Claude. "Do let\r\nher say it to me."\r\n\r\nHe looked hard for a moment at his little friend. "How do you know what\r\nshe may say?"\r\n\r\n"She must risk it," Ida remarked.\r\n\r\n"I only want to protect you," he continued to the child.\r\n\r\n"You want to protect yourself--that\'s what you mean," his wife replied.\r\n"Don\'t be afraid. I won\'t touch you."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t touch you--she WON\'T!" Maisie declared. She felt by this time\r\nthat she could really answer for it, and something of the emotion with\r\nwhich she had listened to the Captain came back to her. It made her\r\nso happy and so secure that she could positively patronise mamma. She\r\ndid so in the Captain\'s very language. "She\'s good, she\'s good!" she\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord!"--Sir Claude, at this, let himself go. He appeared to have\r\nemitted some sound of derision that was smothered, to Maisie\'s ears, by\r\nher being again embraced by his wife. Ida released her and held her off\r\na little, looking at her with a very queer face. Then the child became\r\naware that their companion had left them and that from the face in\r\nquestion a confirmatory remark had proceeded.\r\n\r\n"I AM good, love," said her ladyship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nA good deal of the rest of Ida\'s visit was devoted to explaining, as it\r\nwere, so extraordinary a statement. This explanation was more copious\r\nthan any she had yet indulged in, and as the summer twilight gathered\r\nand she kept her child in the garden she was conciliatory to a degree\r\nthat let her need to arrange things a little perceptibly peep out. It\r\nwas not merely that she explained; she almost conversed; all that was\r\nwanting was that she should have positively chattered a little less. It\r\nwas really the occasion of Maisie\'s life on which her mother was to have\r\nmost to say to her. That alone was an implication of generosity and\r\nvirtue, and no great stretch was required to make our young lady feel\r\nthat she should best meet her and soonest have it over by simply seeming\r\nstruck with the propriety of her contention. They sat together while\r\nthe parent\'s gloved hand sometimes rested sociably on the child\'s and\r\nsometimes gave a corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a tress too\r\nthick; and Maisie was conscious of the effort to keep out of her eyes\r\nthe wonder with which they were occasionally moved to blink. Oh there\r\nwould have been things to blink at if one had let one\'s self go; and\r\nit was lucky they were alone together, without Sir Claude or Mrs. Wix\r\nor even Mrs. Beale to catch an imprudent glance. Though profuse and\r\nprolonged her ladyship was not exhaustively lucid, and her account of\r\nher situation, so far as it could be called descriptive, was a muddle\r\nof inconsequent things, bruised fruit of an occasion she had rather too\r\nlightly affronted. None of them were really thought out and some were\r\neven not wholly insincere. It was as if she had asked outright what\r\nbetter proof could have been wanted of her goodness and her greatness\r\nthan just this marvellous consent to give up what she had so cherished.\r\nIt was as if she had said in so many words: "There have been things\r\nbetween us--between Sir Claude and me--which I needn\'t go into, you\r\nlittle nuisance, because you wouldn\'t understand them." It suited her\r\nto convey that Maisie had been kept, so far as SHE was concerned or\r\ncould imagine, in a holy ignorance and that she must take for granted a\r\nsupreme simplicity. She turned this way and that in the predicament she\r\nhad sought and from which she could neither retreat with grace nor\r\nemerge with credit: she draped herself in the tatters of her impudence,\r\npostured to her utmost before the last little triangle of cracked glass\r\nto which so many fractures had reduced the polished plate of filial\r\nsuperstition. If neither Sir Claude nor Mrs. Wix was there this was\r\nperhaps all the more a pity: the scene had a style of its own that would\r\nhave qualified it for presentation, especially at such a moment as that\r\nof her letting it betray that she quite did think her wretched offspring\r\nbetter placed with Sir Claude than in her own soiled hands. There was at\r\nany rate nothing scant either in her admissions or her perversions, the\r\nmixture of her fear of what Maisie might undiscoverably think and of the\r\nsupport she at the same time gathered from a necessity of selfishness\r\nand a habit of brutality. This habit flushed through the merit she now\r\nmade, in terms explicit, of not having come to Folkestone to kick up a\r\nvulgar row. She had not come to box any ears or to bang any doors or\r\neven to use any language: she had come at the worst to lose the thread\r\nof her argument in an occasional dumb disgusted twitch of the toggery in\r\nwhich Mrs. Beale\'s low domestic had had the impudence to serve up Miss\r\nFarange. She checked all criticism, not committing herself even so far\r\nas for those missing comforts of the schoolroom on which Mrs. Wix had\r\npresumed.\r\n\r\n"I AM good--I\'m crazily, I\'m criminally good. But it won\'t do for YOU\r\nany more, and if I\'ve ceased to contend with him, and with you too, who\r\nhave made most of the trouble between us, it\'s for reasons that you\'ll\r\nunderstand one of these days but too well--one of these days when I\r\nhope you\'ll know what it is to have lost a mother. I\'m awfully ill, but\r\nyou mustn\'t ask me anything about it. If I don\'t get off somewhere my\r\ndoctor won\'t answer for the consequences. He\'s stupefied at what I\'ve\r\nborne--he says it has been put on me because I was formed to suffer. I\'m\r\nthinking of South Africa, but that\'s none of your business. You must\r\ntake your choice--you can\'t ask me questions if you\'re so ready to\r\ngive me up. No, I won\'t tell you; you can find out for yourself. South\r\nAfrica\'s wonderful, they say, and if I do go it must be to give it a\r\nfair trial. It must be either one thing or the other; if he takes you,\r\nyou know, he takes you. I\'ve struck my last blow for you; I can follow\r\nyou no longer from pillar to post. I must live for myself at last, while\r\nthere\'s still a handful left of me. I\'m very, very ill; I\'m very, very\r\ntired; I\'m very, very determined. There you have it. Make the most of\r\nit. Your frock\'s too filthy; but I came to sacrifice myself." Maisie\r\nlooked at the peccant places; there were moments when it was a relief to\r\nher to drop her eyes even on anything so sordid. All her interviews, all\r\nher ordeals with her mother had, as she had grown older, seemed to have,\r\nbefore any other, the hard quality of duration; but longer than any,\r\nstrangely, were these minutes offered to her as so pacific and so\r\nagreeably winding up the connexion. It was her anxiety that made them\r\nlong, her fear of some hitch, some check of the current, one of her\r\nladyship\'s famous quick jumps. She held her breath; she only wanted,\r\nby playing into her visitor\'s hands, to see the thing through. But her\r\nimpatience itself made at instants the whole situation swim; there were\r\nthings Ida said that she perhaps didn\'t hear, and there were things\r\nshe heard that Ida perhaps didn\'t say. "You\'re all I have, and yet I\'m\r\ncapable of this. Your father wishes you were dead--that, my dear, is\r\nwhat your father wishes. You\'ll have to get used to it as I\'ve done--I\r\nmean to his wishing that I\'M dead. At all events you see for yourself\r\nhow wonderful I am to Sir Claude. He wishes me dead quite as much; and\r\nI\'m sure that if making me scenes about YOU could have killed me--!" It\r\nwas the mark of Ida\'s eloquence that she started more hares than she\r\nfollowed, and she gave but a glance in the direction of this one; going\r\non to say that the very proof of her treating her husband like an angel\r\nwas that he had just stolen off not to be fairly shamed. She spoke as\r\nif he had retired on tiptoe, as he might have withdrawn from a place\r\nof worship in which he was not fit to be present. "You\'ll never know\r\nwhat I\'ve been through about you--never, never, never. I spare you\r\neverything, as I always have; though I dare say you know things that,\r\nif I did (I mean if I knew them) would make me--well, no matter! You\'re\r\nold enough at any rate to know there are a lot of things I don\'t say\r\nthat I easily might; though it would do me good, I assure you, to have\r\nspoken my mind for once in my life. I don\'t speak of your father\'s\r\ninfamous wife: that may give you a notion of the way I\'m letting you\r\noff. When I say \'you\' I mean your precious friends and backers. If you\r\ndon\'t do justice to my forbearing, out of delicacy, to mention, just as\r\na last word, about your stepfather, a little fact or two of a kind that\r\nreally I should only HAVE to mention to shine myself in comparison, and\r\nafter every calumny, like pure gold: if you don\'t do me THAT justice\r\nyou\'ll never do me justice at all!"\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s desire to show what justice she did her had by this time become\r\nso intense as to have brought with it an inspiration. The great effect\r\nof their encounter had been to confirm her sense of being launched with\r\nSir Claude, to make it rich and full beyond anything she had dreamed,\r\nand everything now conspired to suggest that a single soft touch of her\r\nsmall hand would complete the good work and set her ladyship so promptly\r\nand majestically afloat as to leave the great seaway clear for the\r\nmorrow. This was the more the case as her hand had for some moments been\r\nrendered free by a marked manoeuvre of both of her mother\'s. One of\r\nthese capricious members had fumbled with visible impatience in some\r\nbackward depth of drapery and had presently reappeared with a small\r\narticle in its grasp. The act had a significance for a little person\r\ntrained, in that relation, from an early age, to keep an eye on manual\r\nmotions, and its possible bearing was not darkened by the memory of the\r\nhandful of gold that Susan Ash would never, never believe Mrs. Beale had\r\nsent back--"not she; she\'s too false and too greedy!"--to the munificent\r\nCountess. To have guessed, none the less, that her ladyship\'s purse\r\nmight be the real figure of the object extracted from the rustling\r\ncovert at her rear--this suspicion gave on the spot to the child\'s eyes\r\na direction carefully distant. It added moreover to the optimism that\r\nfor an hour could ruffle the surface of her deep diplomacy, ruffle it\r\nto the point of making her forget that she had never been safe unless\r\nshe had also been stupid. She in short forgot her habitual caution in\r\nher impulse to adopt her ladyship\'s practical interests and show her\r\nladyship how perfectly she understood them. She saw without looking\r\nthat her mother pressed a little clasp; heard, without wanting to,\r\nthe sharp click that marked the closing portemonnaie from which\r\nsomething had been taken. What this was she just didn\'t see; it was not\r\ntoo substantial to be locked with ease in the fold of her ladyship\'s\r\nfingers. Nothing was less new to Maisie than the art of not thinking\r\nsingly, so that at this instant she could both bring out what was on\r\nher tongue\'s end and weigh, as to the object in her mother\'s palm, the\r\nquestion of its being a sovereign against the question of its being a\r\nshilling. No sooner had she begun to speak than she saw that within a\r\nfew seconds this question would have been settled: she had foolishly\r\nchecked the rising words of the little speech of presentation to which,\r\nunder the circumstances, even such a high pride as Ida\'s had had to give\r\nsome thought. She had checked it completely--that was the next thing she\r\nfelt: the note she sounded brought into her companion\'s eyes a look that\r\nquickly enough seemed at variance with presentations.\r\n\r\n"That was what the Captain said to me that day, mamma. I think it would\r\nhave given you pleasure to hear the way he spoke of you."\r\n\r\nThe pleasure, Maisie could now in consternation reflect, would have been\r\na long time coming if it had come no faster than the response evoked by\r\nher allusion to it. Her mother gave her one of the looks that slammed\r\nthe door in her face; never in a career of unsuccessful experiments had\r\nMaisie had to take such a stare. It reminded her of the way that once,\r\nat one of the lectures in Glower Street, something in a big jar that,\r\namid an array of strange glasses and bad smells, had been promised as a\r\nbeautiful yellow was produced as a beautiful black. She had been sorry\r\non that occasion for the lecturer, but she was at this moment sorrier\r\nfor herself. Oh nothing had ever made for twinges like mamma\'s manner of\r\nsaying: "The Captain? What Captain?"\r\n\r\n"Why when we met you in the Gardens--the one who took me to sit with\r\nhim. That was exactly what HE said."\r\n\r\nIda let it come on so far as to appear for an instant to pick up a lost\r\nthread. "What on earth did he say?"\r\n\r\nMaisie faltered supremely, but supremely she brought it out. "What you\r\nsay, mamma--that you\'re so good."\r\n\r\n"What \'I\' say?" Ida slowly rose, keeping her eyes on her child, and the\r\nhand that had busied itself in her purse conformed at her side and amid\r\nthe folds of her dress to a certain stiffening of the arm. "I say you\'re\r\na precious idiot, and I won\'t have you put words into my mouth!" This\r\nwas much more peremptory than a mere contradiction. Maisie could only\r\nfeel on the spot that everything had broken short off and that their\r\ncommunication had abruptly ceased. That was presently proved. "What\r\nbusiness have you to speak to me of him?"\r\n\r\nHer daughter turned scarlet. "I thought you liked him."\r\n\r\n"Him!--the biggest cad in London!" Her ladyship towered again, and in\r\nthe gathering dusk the whites of her eyes were huge.\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s own, however, could by this time pretty well match them; and\r\nshe had at least now, with the first flare of anger that had ever yet\r\nlighted her face for a foe, the sense of looking up quite as hard as any\r\none could look down. "Well, he was kind about you then; he WAS, and it\r\nmade me like him. He said things--they were beautiful, they were, they\r\nwere!" She was almost capable of the violence of forcing this home, for\r\neven in the midst of her surge of passion--of which in fact it was a\r\npart--there rose in her a fear, a pain, a vision ominous, precocious,\r\nof what it might mean for her mother\'s fate to have forfeited such a\r\nloyalty as that. There was literally an instant in which Maisie fully\r\nsaw--saw madness and desolation, saw ruin and darkness and death. "I\'ve\r\nthought of him often since, and I hoped it was with him--with him--"\r\nHere, in her emotion, it failed her, the breath of her filial hope.\r\n\r\nBut Ida got it out of her. "You hoped, you little horror--?"\r\n\r\n"That it was he who\'s at Dover, that it was he who\'s to take you. I mean\r\nto South Africa," Maisie said with another drop.\r\n\r\nIda\'s stupefaction, on this, kept her silent unnaturally long, so long\r\nthat her daughter could not only wonder what was coming, but perfectly\r\nmeasure the decline of every symptom of her liberality. She loomed there\r\nin her grandeur, merely dark and dumb; her wrath was clearly still, as\r\nit had always been, a thing of resource and variety. What Maisie least\r\nexpected of it was by this law what now occurred. It melted, in the\r\nsummer twilight, gradually into pity, and the pity after a little found\r\na cadence to which the renewed click of her purse gave an accent.\r\nShe had put back what she had taken out. "You\'re a dreadful dismal\r\ndeplorable little thing," she murmured. And with this she turned back\r\nand rustled away over the lawn.\r\n\r\nAfter she had disappeared, Maisie dropped upon the bench again and for\r\nsome time, in the empty garden and the deeper dusk, sat and stared at\r\nthe image her flight had still left standing. It had ceased to be her\r\nmother only, in the strangest way, that it might become her father, the\r\nfather of whose wish that she were dead the announcement still lingered\r\nin the air. It was a presence with vague edges--it continued to front\r\nher, to cover her. But what reality that she need reckon with did it\r\nrepresent if Mr. Farange were, on his side, also going off--going off to\r\nAmerica with the Countess, or even only to Spa? That question had, from\r\nthe house, a sudden gay answer in the great roar of a gong, and at the\r\nsame moment she saw Sir Claude look out for her from the wide lighted\r\ndoorway. At this she went to him and he came forward and met her on the\r\nlawn. For a minute she was with him there in silence as, just before, at\r\nthe last, she had been with her mother.\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone."\r\n\r\nNothing more, for the instant, passed between them but to move together\r\nto the house, where, in the hall, he indulged in one of those sudden\r\npleasantries with which, to the delight of his stepdaughter, his native\r\nanimation overflowed. "Will Miss Farange do me the honour to accept my\r\narm?"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in all her days that Miss Farange had accepted with\r\nsuch bliss, a bright rich element that floated them together to their\r\nfeast; before they reached which, however, she uttered, in the spirit\r\nof a glad young lady taken in to her first dinner, a sociable word that\r\nmade him stop short. "She goes to South Africa."\r\n\r\n"To South Africa?" His face, for a moment, seemed to swing for a jump;\r\nthe next it took its spring into the extreme of hilarity. "Is that what\r\nshe said?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I didn\'t MISTAKE!" Maisie took to herself THAT credit. "For the\r\nclimate."\r\n\r\nSir Claude was now looking at a young woman with black hair, a red frock\r\nand a tiny terrier tucked under her elbow. She swept past them on her\r\nway to the dining-room, leaving an impression of a strong scent which\r\nmingled, amid the clatter of the place, with the hot aroma of food. He\r\nhad become a little graver; he still stopped to talk. "I see--I see."\r\nOther people brushed by; he was not too grave to notice them. "Did she\r\nsay anything else?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, a lot more."\r\n\r\nOn this he met her eyes again with some intensity, but only repeating:\r\n"I see--I see."\r\n\r\nMaisie had still her own vision, which she brought out. "I thought she\r\nwas going to give me something."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a thing?"\r\n\r\n"Some money that she took out of her purse and then put back."\r\n\r\nSir Claude\'s amusement reappeared. "She thought better of it. Dear\r\nthrifty soul! How much did she make by that manoeuvre?"\r\n\r\nMaisie considered. "I didn\'t see. It was very small."\r\n\r\nSir Claude threw back his head. "Do you mean very little? Sixpence?"\r\n\r\nMaisie resented this almost as if, at dinner, she were already bandying\r\njokes with an agreeable neighbour. "It may have been a sovereign."\r\n\r\n"Or even," Sir Claude suggested, "a ten-pound note." She flushed at this\r\nsudden picture of what she perhaps had lost, and he made it more vivid\r\nby adding: "Rolled up in a tight little ball, you know--her way of\r\ntreating banknotes as if they were curl-papers!" Maisie\'s flush deepened\r\nboth with the immense plausibility of this and with a fresh wave of the\r\nconsciousness that was always there to remind her of his cleverness--the\r\nconsciousness of how immeasurably more after all he knew about mamma\r\nthan she. She had lived with her so many times without discovering the\r\nmaterial of her curl-papers or assisting at any other of her dealings\r\nwith banknotes. The tight little ball had at any rate rolled away from\r\nher for ever--quite like one of the other balls that Ida\'s cue used to\r\nsend flying. Sir Claude gave her his arm again, and by the time she was\r\nseated at table she had perfectly made up her mind as to the amount of\r\nthe sum she had forfeited. Everything about her, however--the crowded\r\nroom, the bedizened banquet, the savour of dishes, the drama of\r\nfigures--ministered to the joy of life. After dinner she smoked with her\r\nfriend--for that was exactly what she felt she did--on a porch, a kind\r\nof terrace, where the red tips of cigars and the light dresses of ladies\r\nmade, under the happy stars, a poetry that was almost intoxicating.\r\nThey talked but little, and she was slightly surprised at his asking\r\nfor no more news of what her mother had said; but she had no need of\r\ntalk--there were a sense and a sound in everything to which words had\r\nnothing to add. They smoked and smoked, and there was a sweetness in her\r\nstepfather\'s silence. At last he said: "Let us take another turn--but\r\nyou must go to bed soon. Oh you know, we\'re going to have a system!"\r\nTheir turn was back into the garden, along the dusky paths from which\r\nthey could see the black masts and the red lights of boats and hear the\r\ncalls and cries that evidently had to do with happy foreign travel; and\r\ntheir system was once more to get on beautifully in this further lounge\r\nwithout a definite exchange. Yet he finally spoke--he broke out as he\r\ntossed away the match from which he had taken a fresh light: "I must go\r\nfor a stroll. I\'m in a fidget--I must walk it off." She fell in with\r\nthis as she fell in with everything; on which he went on: "You go up to\r\nMiss Ash"--it was the name they had started; "you must see she\'s not in\r\nmischief. Can you find your way alone?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I\'ve been up and down seven times." She positively enjoyed the\r\nprospect of an eighth.\r\n\r\nStill they didn\'t separate; they stood smoking together under the stars.\r\nThen at last Sir Claude produced it. "I\'m free--I\'m free."\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him; it was the very spot on which a couple of hours\r\nbefore she had looked up at her mother. "You\'re free--you\'re free."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow we go to France." He spoke as if he hadn\'t heard her; but it\r\ndidn\'t prevent her again concurring.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow we go to France."\r\n\r\nAgain he appeared not to have heard her; and after a moment--it was an\r\neffect evidently of the depth of his reflexions and the agitation of\r\nhis soul--he also spoke as if he had not spoken before. "I\'m free--I\'m\r\nfree!"\r\n\r\nShe repeated her form of assent. "You\'re free--you\'re free."\r\n\r\nThis time he did hear her; he fixed her through the darkness with a\r\ngrave face. But he said nothing more; he simply stooped a little and\r\ndrew her to him--simply held her a little and kissed her goodnight;\r\nafter which, having given her a silent push upstairs to Miss Ash, he\r\nturned round again to the black masts and the red lights. Maisie mounted\r\nas if France were at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day it seemed to her indeed at the bottom--down too far, in\r\nshuddering plunges, even to leave her a sense, on the Channel boat, of\r\nthe height at which Sir Claude remained and which had never in every way\r\nbeen so great as when, much in the wet, though in the angle of a screen\r\nof canvas, he sociably sat with his stepdaughter\'s head in his lap and\r\nthat of Mrs. Beale\'s housemaid fairly pillowed on his breast. Maisie was\r\nsurprised to learn as they drew into port that they had had a lovely\r\npassage; but this emotion, at Boulogne, was speedily quenched in others,\r\nabove all in the great ecstasy of a larger impression of life. She was\r\n"abroad" and she gave herself up to it, responded to it, in the bright\r\nair, before the pink houses, among the bare-legged fishwives and the\r\nred-legged soldiers, with the instant certitude of a vocation. Her\r\nvocation was to see the world and to thrill with enjoyment of the\r\npicture; she had grown older in five minutes and had by the time they\r\nreached the hotel recognised in the institutions and manners of France a\r\nmultitude of affinities and messages. Literally in the course of an hour\r\nshe found her initiation; a consciousness much quickened by the superior\r\npart that, as soon as they had gobbled down a French breakfast--which\r\nwas indeed a high note in the concert--she observed herself to play to\r\nSusan Ash. Sir Claude, who had already bumped against people he knew and\r\nwho, as he said, had business and letters, sent them out together for a\r\nwalk, a walk in which the child was avenged, so far as poetic justice\r\nrequired, not only for the loud giggles that in their London trudges\r\nused to break from her attendant, but for all the years of her tendency\r\nto produce socially that impression of an excess of the queer something\r\nwhich had seemed to waver so widely between innocence and guilt. On the\r\nspot, at Boulogne, though there might have been excess there was at\r\nleast no wavering; she recognised, she understood, she adored and took\r\npossession; feeling herself attuned to everything and laying her hand,\r\nright and left, on what had simply been waiting for her. She explained\r\nto Susan, she laughed at Susan, she towered over Susan; and it was\r\nsomehow Susan\'s stupidity, of which she had never yet been so sure,\r\nand Susan\'s bewilderment and ignorance and antagonism, that gave the\r\nliveliest rebound to her immediate perceptions and adoptions. The place\r\nand the people were all a picture together, a picture that, when they\r\nwent down to the wide sands, shimmered, in a thousand tints, with the\r\npretty organisation of the _plage_, with the gaiety of spectators and\r\nbathers, with that of the language and the weather, and above all with\r\nthat of our young lady\'s unprecedented situation. For it appeared to her\r\nthat no one since the beginning of time could have had such an adventure\r\nor, in an hour, so much experience; as a sequel to which she only\r\nneeded, in order to feel with conscious wonder how the past was changed,\r\nto hear Susan, inscrutably aggravated, express a preference for the\r\nEdgware Road. The past was so changed and the circle it had formed\r\nalready so overstepped that on that very afternoon, in the course of\r\nanother walk, she found herself enquiring of Sir Claude--without a\r\nsingle scruple--if he were prepared as yet to name the moment at which\r\nthey should start for Paris. His answer, it must be said, gave her the\r\nleast little chill.\r\n\r\n"Oh Paris, my dear child--I don\'t quite know about Paris!"\r\n\r\nThis required to be met, but it was much less to challenge him than for\r\nthe rich joy of her first discussion of the details of a tour that,\r\nafter looking at him a minute, she replied: "Well, isn\'t that the REAL\r\nthing, the thing that when one does come abroad--?"\r\n\r\nHe had turned grave again, and she merely threw that out: it was a way\r\nof doing justice to the seriousness of their life. She couldn\'t moreover\r\nbe so much older since yesterday without reflecting that if by this time\r\nshe probed a little he would recognise that she had done enough for mere\r\npatience. There was in fact something in his eyes that suddenly, to her\r\nown, made her discretion shabby. Before she could remedy this he had\r\nanswered her last question, answered it in the way that, of all ways,\r\nshe had least expected. "The thing it doesn\'t do not to do? Certainly\r\nParis is charming. But, my dear fellow, Paris eats your head off. I mean\r\nit\'s so beastly expensive."\r\n\r\nThat note gave her a pang--it suddenly let in a harder light. Were they\r\npoor then, that is was HE poor, really poor beyond the pleasantry of\r\napollinaris and cold beef? They had walked to the end of the long jetty\r\nthat enclosed the harbour and were looking out at the dangers they had\r\nescaped, the grey horizon that was England, the tumbled surface of the\r\nsea and the brown smacks that bobbed upon it. Why had he chosen an\r\nembarrassed time to make this foreign dash? unless indeed it was just\r\nthe dash economic, of which she had often heard and on which, after\r\nanother look at the grey horizon and the bobbing boats, she was ready\r\nto turn round with elation. She replied to him quite in his own manner:\r\n"I see, I see." She smiled up at him. "Our affairs are involved."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it." He returned her smile. "Mine are not quite so bad as yours;\r\nfor yours are really, my dear man, in a state I can\'t see through at\r\nall. But mine will do--for a mess."\r\n\r\nShe thought this over. "But isn\'t France cheaper than England?"\r\n\r\nEngland, over there in the thickening gloom, looked just then remarkably\r\ndear. "I dare say; some parts."\r\n\r\n"Then can\'t we live in those parts?"\r\n\r\nThere was something that for an instant, in satisfaction of this, he had\r\nthe air of being about to say and yet not saying. What he presently said\r\nwas: "This very place is one of them."\r\n\r\n"Then we shall live here?"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t treat it quite so definitely as she liked. "Since we\'ve come\r\nto save money!"\r\n\r\nThis made her press him more. "How long shall we stay?"\r\n\r\n"Oh three or four days."\r\n\r\nIt took her breath away. "You can save money in that time?"\r\n\r\nHe burst out laughing, starting to walk again and taking her under his\r\narm. He confessed to her on the way that she too had put a finger on\r\nthe weakest of all his weaknesses, the fact, of which he was perfectly\r\naware, that he probably might have lived within his means if he had\r\nnever done anything for thrift. "It\'s the happy thoughts that do it," he\r\nsaid; "there\'s nothing so ruinous as putting in a cheap week." Maisie\r\nheard afresh among the pleasant sounds of the closing day that steel\r\nclick of Ida\'s change of mind. She thought of the ten-pound note\r\nit would have been delightful at this juncture to produce for her\r\ncompanion\'s encouragement. But the idea was dissipated by his saying\r\nirrelevantly, in presence of the next thing they stopped to admire: "We\r\nshall stay till she arrives."\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him. "Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Wix. I\'ve had a wire," he went on. "She has seen your mother."\r\n\r\n"Seen mamma?" Maisie stared. "Where in the world?"\r\n\r\n"Apparently in London. They\'ve been together."\r\n\r\nFor an instant this looked ominous--a fear came into her eyes. "Then\r\nshe hasn\'t gone?"\r\n\r\n"Your mother?--to South Africa? I give it up, dear boy," Sir Claude\r\nsaid; and she seemed literally to see him give it up as he stood\r\nthere and with a kind of absent gaze--absent, that is, from HER\r\naffairs--followed the fine stride and shining limbs of a young fishwife\r\nwho had just waded out of the sea with her basketful of shrimps. His\r\nthought came back to her sooner than his eyes. "But I dare say it\'s all\r\nright. She wouldn\'t come if it wasn\'t, poor old thing: she knows rather\r\nwell what she\'s about."\r\n\r\nThis was so reassuring that Maisie, after turning it over, could make it\r\nfit into her dream. "Well, what IS she about?"\r\n\r\nHe finally stopped looking at the fishwife--he met his companion\'s\r\nenquiry. "Oh you know!" There was something in the way he said it that\r\nmade, between them, more of an equality than she had yet imagined; but\r\nit had also more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down,\r\nand what it did with her was shown by the sound of her assent.\r\n\r\n"Yes--I know!" What she knew, what she COULD know is by this time no\r\nsecret to us: it grew and grew at any rate, the rest of that day, in the\r\nair of what he took for granted. It was better he should do that than\r\nattempt to test her knowledge; but there at the worst was the gist of\r\nthe matter: it was open between them at last that their great change,\r\nas, speaking as if it had already lasted weeks, Maisie called it, was\r\nsomehow built up round Mrs. Wix. Before she went to bed that night she\r\nknew further that Sir Claude, since, as HE called it, they had been on\r\nthe rush, had received more telegrams than one. But they separated again\r\nwithout speaking of Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\nOh what a crossing for the straighteners and the old brown dress--which\r\nlatter appurtenance the child saw thriftily revived for the possible\r\ndisasters of travel! The wind got up in the night and from her little\r\nroom at the inn Maisie could hear the noise of the sea. The next day it\r\nwas raining and everything different: this was the case even with Susan\r\nAsh, who positively crowed over the bad weather, partly, it seemed, for\r\nrelish of the time their visitor would have in the boat, and partly to\r\npoint the moral of the folly of coming to such holes. In the wet, with\r\nSir Claude, Maisie went to the Folkestone packet, on the arrival of\r\nwhich, with many signs of the fray, he made her wait under an umbrella\r\nby the quay; whence almost ere the vessel touched, he was to be\r\ndescried, in quest of their friend, wriggling--that had been his\r\nword--through the invalids massed upon the deck. It was long till\r\nhe reappeared--it was not indeed till every one had landed; when he\r\npresented the object of his benevolence in a light that Maisie scarce\r\nknew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of\r\ntriumph. The lady on his arm, still bent beneath her late ordeal, was\r\nmuffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support\r\nto so much woe. At the hotel, an hour later, this ambiguity dropped:\r\nassisting Mrs. Wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself, Maisie\r\nheard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if Sir\r\nClaude hadn\'t put it in her power. It was a phrase that in her room she\r\nrepeated in connexions indescribable: he had put it in her power to have\r\n"changes," as she said, of the most intimate order, adapted to climates\r\nand occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of\r\na vast itinerary. Cheap weeks would of course be in their place after\r\nso much money spent on a governess; sums not grudged, however, by this\r\nlady\'s pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through\r\nthe straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified. Sir Claude in\r\ntruth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix\'s; and moreover\r\nshe would rather be in her own shoes than in her friend\'s creaking new\r\nones in the event of an encounter with Mrs. Beale. Maisie was too lost\r\nin the idea of Mrs. Beale\'s judgement of so much newness to pass any\r\njudgement herself. Besides, after much luncheon and many endearments,\r\nthe question took quite another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure\r\nof the child\'s quick view that there were other eyes than Susan Ash\'s\r\nto open to what she could show. She couldn\'t show much, alas, till it\r\nstopped raining, which it declined to do that day; but this had only the\r\neffect of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix\'s own demonstration. It came\r\nas they sat in the little white and gold salon which Maisie thought the\r\nloveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the\r\nCountess; it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and\r\nblew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and\r\ncigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning\r\nback, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy\r\nlittle chimney. It came in spite of something that could only be named\r\nhis air of wishing to put it off; an air that had served him--oh as all\r\nhis airs served him!--to the extent of his having for a couple of hours\r\nconfined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it\r\non the level of the little empty coffee-cups and _petits verres_ (Mrs.\r\nWix had two of each!) that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the\r\nFrench fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they\r\nwere launched. She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs.\r\nWix had told her, that what this lady had come over for was not merely\r\nto be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; not even to hear Sir\r\nClaude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds\r\nemitted by the English folk at the hotel. It was perhaps half an effect\r\nof her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody\'s else:\r\nshe had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour,\r\nof a redness associated in Maisie\'s mind at THAT pitch either with\r\nmeasles or with "habits." Her heart was not at all in the gossip about\r\nBoulogne; and if her complexion was partly the result of the d\xe9jeuner\r\nand the _petits verres_ it was also the brave signal of what she was\r\nthere to say. Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been\r\nawaited by the youngest member of the party. "Her ladyship packed me\r\noff--she almost put me into the cab!" That was what Mrs. Wix at last\r\nbrought out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Claude was stationed at the window; he didn\'t so much as turn round,\r\nand it was left to the youngest of the three to take up the remark. "Do\r\nyou mean you went to see her yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"She came to see ME. She knocked at my shabby door. She mounted my\r\nsqualid stair. She told me she had seen you at Folkestone."\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered. "She went back that evening?"\r\n\r\n"No; yesterday morning. She drove to me straight from the station. It\r\nwas most remarkable. If I had a job to get off she did nothing to make\r\nit worse--she did a great deal to make it better." Mrs. Wix hung fire,\r\nthough the flame in her face burned brighter; then she became capable\r\nof saying: "Her ladyship\'s kind! She did what I didn\'t expect."\r\n\r\nMaisie, on this, looked straight at her stepfather\'s back; it might well\r\nhave been for her at that hour a monument of her ladyship\'s kindness. It\r\nremained, as such, monumentally still, and for a time that permitted the\r\nchild to ask of their companion: "Did she really help you?"\r\n\r\n"Most practically." Again Mrs. Wix paused; again she quite resounded.\r\n"She gave me a ten-pound note."\r\n\r\nAt that, still looking out, Sir Claude, at the window, laughed loud. "So\r\nyou see, Maisie, we\'ve not quite lost it!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no," Maisie responded. "Isn\'t that too charming?" She smiled at Mrs.\r\nWix. "We know all about it." Then on her friend\'s showing such blankness\r\nas was compatible with such a flush she pursued: "She does want me to\r\nhave you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix showed a final hesitation, which, however, while Sir Claude\r\ndrummed on the window-pane, she presently surmounted. It came to Maisie\r\nthat in spite of his drumming and of his not turning round he was really\r\nso much interested as to leave himself in a manner in her hands; which\r\nsomehow suddenly seemed to her a greater proof than he could have given\r\nby interfering. "She wants me to have YOU!" Mrs. Wix declared.\r\n\r\nMaisie answered this bang at Sir Claude. "Then that\'s nice for all of\r\nus."\r\n\r\nOf course it was, his continued silence sufficiently admitted while\r\nMrs. Wix rose from her chair and, as if to take more of a stand, placed\r\nherself, not without majesty, before the fire. The incongruity of her\r\nsmartness, the circumference of her stiff frock, presented her as really\r\nmore ready for Paris than any of them. She also gazed hard at Sir\r\nClaude\'s back. "Your wife was different from anything she had ever shown\r\nme. She recognises certain proprieties."\r\n\r\n"Which? Do you happen to remember?" Sir Claude asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix\'s reply was prompt. "The importance for Maisie of a\r\ngentlewoman, of some one who\'s not--well, so bad! She objects to a mere\r\nmaid, and I don\'t in the least mind telling you what she wants me to\r\ndo." One thing was clear--Mrs. Wix was now bold enough for anything.\r\n"She wants me to persuade you to get rid of the person from Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s."\r\n\r\nMaisie waited for Sir Claude to pronounce on this; then she could only\r\nunderstand that he on his side waited, and she felt particularly full of\r\ncommon sense as she met her responsibility. "Oh I don\'t want Susan with\r\nYOU!" she said to Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\nSir Claude, always from the window, approved. "That\'s quite simple. I\'ll\r\ntake her back."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix gave a positive jump; Maisie caught her look of alarm. "\'Take\'\r\nher? You don\'t mean to go over on purpose?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude said nothing for a moment; after which, "Why shouldn\'t I\r\nleave you here?" he enquired.\r\n\r\nMaisie, at this, sprang up. "Oh do, oh do, oh do!" The next moment she\r\nwas interlaced with Mrs. Wix, and the two, on the hearth-rug, their eyes\r\nin each other\'s eyes, considered the plan with intensity. Then Maisie\r\nfelt the difference of what they saw in it.\r\n\r\n"She can surely go back alone: why should you put yourself out?" Mrs.\r\nWix demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh she\'s an idiot--she\'s incapable. If anything should happen to her\r\nit would be awkward: it was I who brought her--without her asking. If I\r\nturn her away I ought with my own hand to place her again exactly where\r\nI found her."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix\'s face appealed to Maisie on such folly, and her manner,\r\nas directed to their companion, had, to her pupil\'s surprise, an\r\nunprecedented firmness. "Dear Sir Claude, I think you\'re perverse. Pay\r\nher fare and give her a sovereign. She has had an experience that she\r\nnever dreamed of and that will be an advantage to her through life.\r\nIf she goes wrong on the way it will be simply because she wants to,\r\nand, with her expenses and her remuneration--make it even what you\r\nlike!--you\'ll have treated her as handsomely as you always treat every\r\none."\r\n\r\nThis was a new tone--as new as Mrs. Wix\'s cap; and it could strike a\r\nyoung person with a sharpened sense for latent meanings as the upshot of\r\na relation that had taken on a new character. It brought out for Maisie\r\nhow much more even than she had guessed her friends were fighting side\r\nby side. At the same time it needed so definite a justification that as\r\nSir Claude now at last did face them she at first supposed him merely\r\nresentful of excessive familiarity. She was therefore yet more puzzled\r\nto see him show his serene beauty untroubled, as well as an equal\r\ninterest in a matter quite distinct from any freedom but her ladyship\'s.\r\n"Did my wife come alone?" He could ask even that good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n"When she called on me?" Mrs. Wix WAS red now: his good humour wouldn\'t\r\nkeep down her colour, which for a minute glowed there like her ugly\r\nhonesty. "No--there was some one in the cab." The only attenuation she\r\ncould think of was after a minute to add: "But they didn\'t come up."\r\n\r\nSir Claude broke into a laugh--Maisie herself could guess what it was\r\nat: while he now walked about, still laughing, and at the fireplace\r\ngave a gay kick to a displaced log, she felt more vague about almost\r\neverything than about the drollery of such a "they." She in fact could\r\nscarce have told you if it was to deepen or to cover the joke that she\r\nbethought herself to observe: "Perhaps it was her maid."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix gave her a look that at any rate deprecated the wrong tone. "It\r\nwas not her maid."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean there are this time two?" Sir Claude asked as if he hadn\'t\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n"Two maids?" Maisie went on as if she might assume he had.\r\n\r\nThe reproach of the straighteners darkened; but Sir Claude cut across it\r\nwith a sudden: "See here; what do you mean? And what do you suppose SHE\r\nmeant?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix let him for a moment, in silence, understand that the answer\r\nto his question, if he didn\'t take care, might give him more than he\r\nwanted. It was as if, with this scruple, she measured and adjusted all\r\nshe gave him in at last saying: "What she meant was to make me know that\r\nyou\'re definitely free. To have that straight from her was a joy I of\r\ncourse hadn\'t hoped for: it made the assurance, and my delight at it, a\r\nthing I could really proceed upon. You already know now certainly I\'d\r\nhave started even if she hadn\'t pressed me; you already know what, so\r\nlong, we\'ve been looking for and what, as soon as she told me of her\r\nstep taken at Folkestone, I recognised with rapture that we HAVE. It\'s\r\nyour freedom that makes me right"--she fairly bristled with her logic.\r\n"But I don\'t mind telling you that it\'s her action that makes me happy!"\r\n\r\n"Her action?" Sir Claude echoed. "Why, my dear woman, her action is just\r\na hideous crime. It happens to satisfy our sympathies in a way that\'s\r\nquite delicious; but that doesn\'t in the least alter the fact that it\'s\r\nthe most abominable thing ever done. She has chucked our friend here\r\noverboard not a bit less than if she had shoved her shrieking and\r\npleading, out of that window and down two floors to the paving-stones."\r\n\r\nMaisie surveyed serenely the parties to the discussion. "Oh your friend\r\nhere, dear Sir Claude, doesn\'t plead and shriek!"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her a moment. "Never. Never. That\'s one, only one, but\r\ncharming so far as it goes, of about a hundred things we love her for."\r\nThen he pursued to Mrs. Wix: "What I can\'t for the life of me make out\r\nis what Ida is REALLY up to, what game she was playing in turning to you\r\nwith that cursed cheek after the beastly way she has used you. Where--to\r\nexplain her at all--does she fancy she can presently, when we least\r\nexpect it, take it out of us?"\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t fancy anything, nor want anything out of any one. Her\r\ncursed cheek, as you call it, is the best thing I\'ve ever seen in her.\r\nI don\'t care a fig for the beastly way she used me--I forgive it all a\r\nthousand times over!" Mrs. Wix raised her voice as she had never raised\r\nit; she quite triumphed in her lucidity. "I understand her, I almost\r\nadmire her!" she quavered. She spoke as if this might practically\r\nsuffice; yet in charity to fainter lights she threw out an explanation.\r\n"As I\'ve said, she was different; upon my word I wouldn\'t have known\r\nher. She had a glimmering, she had an instinct; they brought her. It was\r\na kind of happy thought, and if you couldn\'t have supposed she would\r\never have had such a thing, why of course I quite agree with you. But\r\nshe did have it! There!"\r\n\r\nMaisie could feel again how a certain rude rightness in this plea might\r\nhave been found exasperating; but as she had often watched Sir Claude in\r\napprehension of displeasures that didn\'t come, so now, instead of saying\r\n"Oh hell!" as her father used, she observed him only to take refuge in a\r\nquestion that at the worst was abrupt.\r\n\r\n"Who IS it this time, do you know?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix tried blind dignity. "Who is what, Sir Claude?"\r\n\r\n"The man who stands the cabs. Who was in the one that waited at your\r\ndoor?"\r\n\r\nAt this challenge she faltered so long that her young friend\'s pitying\r\nconscience gave her a hand. "It wasn\'t the Captain."\r\n\r\nThis good intention, however, only converted the excellent woman\'s\r\nscruple to a more ambiguous stare; besides of course making Sir Claude\r\ngo off. Mrs. Wix fairly appealed to him. "Must I really tell you?"\r\n\r\nHis amusement continued. "Did she make you promise not to?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked at him still harder. "I mean before Maisie."\r\n\r\nSir Claude laughed again. "Why SHE can\'t hurt him!"\r\n\r\nMaisie felt herself, as it passed, brushed by the light humour of this.\r\n"Yes, I can\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\nThe straighteners again roofed her over; after which they seemed to\r\ncrack with the explosion of their wearer\'s honesty. Amid the flying\r\nsplinters Mrs. Wix produced a name. "Mr. Tischbein."\r\n\r\nThere was for an instant a silence that, under Sir Claude\'s influence\r\nand while he and Maisie looked at each other, suddenly pretended to be\r\nthat of gravity. "We don\'t know Mr. Tischbein, do we, dear?"\r\n\r\nMaisie gave the point all needful thought. "No, I can\'t place Mr.\r\nTischbein."\r\n\r\nIt was a passage that worked visibly on their friend. "You must pardon\r\nme, Sir Claude," she said with an austerity of which the note was real,\r\n"if I thank God to your face that he has in his mercy--I mean his mercy\r\nto our charge--allowed me to achieve this act." She gave out a long puff\r\nof pain. "It was time!" Then as if still more to point the moral: "I\r\nsaid just now I understood your wife. I said just now I admired her. I\r\nstand to it: I did both of those things when I saw how even SHE, poor\r\nthing, saw. If you want the dots on the i\'s you shall have them. What\r\nshe came to me for, in spite of everything, was that I\'m just"--she\r\nquavered it out--"well, just clean! What she saw for her daughter was\r\nthat there must at last be a DECENT person!"\r\n\r\nMaisie was quick enough to jump a little at the sound of this\r\nimplication that such a person was what Sir Claude was not; the\r\nnext instant, however, she more profoundly guessed against whom the\r\ndiscrimination was made. She was therefore left the more surprised at\r\nthe complete candour with which he embraced the worst. "If she\'s bent on\r\ndecent persons why has she given her to ME? You don\'t call me a decent\r\nperson, and I\'ll do Ida the justice that SHE never did. I think I\'m as\r\nindecent as any one and that there\'s nothing in my behaviour that makes\r\nmy wife\'s surrender a bit less ignoble!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of your behaviour!" Mrs. Wix cried. "Don\'t say such\r\nhorrible things; they\'re false and they\'re wicked and I forbid you! It\'s\r\nto KEEP you decent that I\'m here and that I\'ve done everything I have\r\ndone. It\'s to save you--I won\'t say from yourself, because in yourself\r\nyou\'re beautiful and good! It\'s to save you from the worst person of\r\nall. I haven\'t, after all, come over to be afraid to speak of her!\r\nThat\'s the person in whose place her ladyship wants such a person as\r\neven me; and if she thought herself, as she as good as told me, not fit\r\nfor Maisie\'s company, it\'s not, as you may well suppose, that she may\r\nmake room for Mrs. Beale!"\r\n\r\nMaisie watched his face as it took this outbreak, and the most she saw\r\nin it was that it turned a little white. That indeed made him look,\r\nas Susan Ash would have said, queer; and it was perhaps a part of the\r\nqueerness that he intensely smiled. "You\'re too hard on Mrs. Beale. She\r\nhas great merits of her own."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, at this, instead of immediately replying, did what Sir Claude\r\nhad been doing before: she moved across to the window and stared a while\r\ninto the storm. There was for a minute, to Maisie\'s sense, a hush that\r\nresounded with wind and rain. Sir Claude, in spite of these things,\r\nglanced about for his hat; on which Maisie spied it first and, making\r\na dash for it, held it out to him. He took it with a gleam of a\r\n"thank-you" in his face, and then something moved her still to hold the\r\nother side of the brim; so that, united by their grasp of this object,\r\nthey stood some seconds looking many things at each other. By this time\r\nMrs. Wix had turned round. "Do you mean to tell me," she demanded, "that\r\nyou are going back?"\r\n\r\n"To Mrs. Beale?" Maisie surrendered his hat, and there was something\r\nthat touched her in the embarrassed, almost humiliated way their\r\ncompanion\'s challenge made him turn it round and round. She had seen\r\npeople do that who, she was sure, did nothing else that Sir Claude did.\r\n"I can\'t just say, my dear thing. We\'ll see about I--we\'ll talk of it\r\nto-morrow. Meantime I must get some air."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, with her back to the window, threw up her head to a height\r\nthat, still for a moment, had the effect of detaining him. "All the air\r\nin France, Sir Claude, won\'t, I think, give you the courage to deny that\r\nyou\'re simply afraid of her!"\r\n\r\nOh this time he did look queer; Maisie had no need of Susan\'s vocabulary\r\nto note it! It would have come to her of itself as, with his hand on\r\nthe door, he turned his eyes from his stepdaughter to her governess and\r\nthen back again. Resting on Maisie\'s, though for ever so short a time,\r\nthere was something they gave up to her and tried to explain. His lips,\r\nhowever, explained nothing; they only surrendered to Mrs. Wix. "Yes. I\'m\r\nsimply afraid of her!" He opened the door and passed out. It brought\r\nback to Maisie his confession of fear of her mother; it made her\r\nstepmother then the second lady about whom he failed of the particular\r\nvirtue that was supposed most to mark a gentleman. In fact there were\r\nthree of them, if she counted in Mrs. Wix, before whom he had undeniably\r\nquailed. Well, his want of valour was but a deeper appeal to her\r\ntenderness. To thrill with response to it she had only to remember all\r\nthe ladies she herself had, as they called it, funked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt continued to rain so hard that our young lady\'s private dream of\r\nexplaining the Continent to their visitor had to contain a provision for\r\nsome adequate treatment of the weather. At the _table d\'h\xf4te_ that evening\r\nshe threw out a variety of lights: this was the second ceremony of the\r\nsort she had sat through, and she would have neglected her privilege\r\nand dishonoured her vocabulary--which indeed consisted mainly of the\r\nnames of dishes--if she had not been proportionately ready to dazzle\r\nwith interpretations. Preoccupied and overawed, Mrs. Wix was apparently\r\ndim: she accepted her pupil\'s version of the mysteries of the menu in a\r\nmanner that might have struck the child as the depression of a credulity\r\nconscious not so much of its needs as of its dimensions. Maisie was soon\r\nenough--though it scarce happened before bedtime--confronted again with\r\nthe different sort of programme for which she reserved her criticism.\r\nThey remounted together to their sitting-room while Sir Claude, who said\r\nhe would join them later, remained below to smoke and to converse with\r\nthe old acquaintances that he met wherever he turned. He had proposed\r\nhis companions, for coffee, the enjoyment of the _salon de lecture_,\r\nbut Mrs. Wix had replied promptly and with something of an air that it\r\nstruck her their own apartments offered them every convenience. They\r\noffered the good lady herself, Maisie could immediately observe, not\r\nonly that of this rather grand reference, which, already emulous, so\r\nfar as it went, of her pupil, she made as if she had spent her life in\r\nsalons; but that of a stiff French sofa where she could sit and stare at\r\nthe faint French lamp, in default of the French clock that had stopped,\r\nas for some account of the time Sir Claude would so markedly interpose.\r\nHer demeanour accused him so directly of hovering beyond her reach that\r\nMaisie sought to divert her by a report of Susan\'s quaint attitude on\r\nthe matter of their conversation after lunch. Maisie had mentioned to\r\nthe young woman for sympathy\'s sake the plan for her relief, but her\r\ndisapproval of alien ways appeared, strange to say, only to prompt her\r\nto hug her gloom; so that between Mrs. Wix\'s effect of displacing her\r\nand the visible stiffening of her back the child had the sense of a\r\ndouble office and enlarged play for pacific powers.\r\n\r\nThese powers played to no great purpose, it was true, in keeping before\r\nMrs. Wix the vision of Sir Claude\'s perversity, which hung there in the\r\npauses of talk and which he himself, after unmistakeable delays, finally\r\nmade quite lurid by bursting in--it was near ten o\'clock--with an object\r\nheld up in his hand. She knew before he spoke what it was; she knew at\r\nleast from the underlying sense of all that, since the hour spent after\r\nthe Exhibition with her father, had not sprung up to reinstate Mr.\r\nFarange--she knew it meant a triumph for Mrs. Beale. The mere present\r\nsight of Sir Claude\'s face caused her on the spot to drop straight\r\nthrough her last impression of Mr. Farange a plummet that reached still\r\ndeeper down than the security of these days of flight. She had wrapped\r\nthat impression in silence--a silence that had parted with half its veil\r\nto cover also, from the hour of Sir Claude\'s advent, the image of Mr.\r\nFarange\'s wife. But if the object in Sir Claude\'s hand revealed itself\r\nas a letter which he held up very high, so there was something in his\r\nmere motion that laid Mrs. Beale again bare. "Here we are!" he cried\r\nalmost from the door, shaking his trophy at them and looking from one to\r\nthe other. Then he came straight to Mrs. Wix; he had pulled two papers\r\nout of the envelope and glanced at them again to see which was which. He\r\nthrust one out open to Mrs. Wix. "Read that." She looked at him hard,\r\nas if in fear: it was impossible not to see he was excited. Then she\r\ntook the letter, but it was not her face that Maisie watched while she\r\nread. Neither, for that matter, was it this countenance that Sir Claude\r\nscanned: he stood before the fire and, more calmly, now that he had\r\nacted, communed in silence with his stepdaughter.\r\n\r\nThe silence was in truth quickly broken; Mrs. Wix rose to her feet with\r\nthe violence of the sound she emitted. The letter had dropped from her\r\nand lay upon the floor; it had made her turn ghastly white and she was\r\nspeechless with the effect of it. "It\'s too abominable--it\'s too\r\nunspeakable!" she then cried.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a charming thing?" Sir Claude asked. "It has just arrived,\r\nenclosed in a word of her own. She sends it on to me with the remark\r\nthat comment\'s superfluous. I really think it is. That\'s all you can\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"She oughtn\'t to pass such a horror about," said Mrs. Wix. "She ought\r\nto put it straight in the fire."\r\n\r\n"My dear woman, she\'s not such a fool! It\'s much too precious." He had\r\npicked the letter up and he gave it again a glance of complacency which\r\nproduced a light in his face. "Such a document"--he considered, then\r\nconcluded with a slight drop--"such a document is, in fine, a basis!"\r\n\r\n"A basis for what?"\r\n\r\n"Well--for proceedings."\r\n\r\n"Hers?" Mrs. Wix\'s voice had become outright the voice of derision. "How\r\ncan SHE proceed?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude turned it over. "How can she get rid of him? Well--she IS rid\r\nof him."\r\n\r\n"Not legally." Mrs. Wix had never looked to her pupil so much as if she\r\nknew what she was talking about.\r\n\r\n"I dare say," Sir Claude laughed; "but she\'s not a bit less deprived\r\nthan I!"\r\n\r\n"Of the power to get a divorce? It\'s just your want of the power that\r\nmakes the scandal of your connexion with her. Therefore it\'s just her\r\nwant of it that makes that of hers with you. That\'s all I contend!" Mrs.\r\nWix concluded with an unparalleled neigh of battle. Oh she did know what\r\nshe was talking about!\r\n\r\nMaisie had meanwhile appealed mutely to Sir Claude, who judged it easier\r\nto meet what she didn\'t say than to meet what Mrs. Wix did.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a letter to Mrs. Beale from your father, my dear, written from\r\nSpa and making the rupture between them perfectly irrevocable. It lets\r\nher know, and not in pretty language, that, as we technically say, he\r\ndeserts her. It puts an end for ever to their relations." He ran his\r\neyes over it again, then appeared to make up his mind. "In fact it\r\nconcerns you, Maisie, so nearly and refers to you so particularly that\r\nI really think you ought to see the terms in which this new situation\r\nis created for you." And he held out the letter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, at this, pounced upon it; she had grabbed it too soon even\r\nfor Maisie to become aware of being rather afraid of it. Thrusting it\r\ninstantly behind her she positively glared at Sir Claude. "See it,\r\nwretched man?--the innocent child SEE such a thing? I think you must be\r\nmad, and she shall not have a glimpse of it while I\'m here to prevent!"\r\n\r\nThe breadth of her action had made Sir Claude turn red--he even looked a\r\nlittle foolish. "You think it\'s too bad, eh? But it\'s precisely because\r\nit\'s bad that it seemed to me it would have a lesson and a virtue for\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMaisie could do a quick enough justice to his motive to be able clearly\r\nto interpose. She fairly smiled at him. "I assure you I can quite\r\nbelieve how bad it is!" She thought of something, kept it back a moment,\r\nand then spoke. "I know what\'s in it!"\r\n\r\nHe of course burst out laughing and, while Mrs. Wix groaned an "Oh\r\nheavens!" replied: "You wouldn\'t say that, old boy, if you did! The\r\npoint I make is," he continued to Mrs. Wix with a blandness now\r\nre-established--"the point I make is simply that it sets Mrs. Beale\r\nfree."\r\n\r\nShe hung fire but an instant. "Free to live with YOU?"\r\n\r\n"Free not to live, not to pretend to live, with her husband."\r\n\r\n"Ah they\'re mighty different things!"--a truth as to which her\r\nearnestness could now with a fine inconsequent look invite the\r\nparticipation of the child.\r\n\r\nBefore Maisie could commit herself, however, the ground was occupied by\r\nSir Claude, who, as he stood before their visitor with an expression\r\nhalf rueful, half persuasive, rubbed his hand sharply up and down the\r\nback of his head. "Then why the deuce do you grant so--do you, I may\r\neven say, rejoice so--that by the desertion of my own precious partner\r\nI\'m free?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix met this challenge first with silence, then with a\r\ndemonstration the most extraordinary, the most unexpected. Maisie could\r\nscarcely believe her eyes as she saw the good lady, with whom she had\r\nassociated no faintest shade of any art of provocation, actually, after\r\nan upward grimace, give Sir Claude a great giggling insinuating naughty\r\nslap. "You wretch--you KNOW why!" And she turned away. The face that\r\nwith this movement she left him to present to Maisie was to abide with\r\nhis stepdaughter as the very image of stupefaction; but the pair lacked\r\ntime to communicate either amusement or alarm before their admonisher\r\nwas upon them again. She had begun in fact to show infinite variety and\r\nshe flashed about with a still quicker change of tone. "Have you brought\r\nme that thing as a pretext for your going over?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude braced himself. "I can\'t, after such news, in common decency\r\nnot go over. I mean, don\'t you know, in common courtesy and humanity.\r\nMy dear lady, you can\'t chuck a woman that way, especially taking the\r\nmoment when she has been most insulted and wronged. A fellow must behave\r\nlike a gentleman, damn it, dear good Mrs. Wix. We didn\'t come away, we\r\ntwo, to hang right on, you know: it was only to try our paces and just\r\nput in a few days that might prove to every one concerned that we\'re in\r\nearnest. It\'s exactly because we\'re in earnest that, dash it, we needn\'t\r\nbe so awfully particular. I mean, don\'t you know, we needn\'t be so\r\nawfully afraid." He showed a vivacity, an intensity of argument, and if\r\nMaisie counted his words she was all the more ready to swallow after a\r\nsingle swift gasp those that, the next thing, she became conscious he\r\npaused for a reply to. "We didn\'t come, old girl, did we," he pleaded\r\nstraight, "to stop right away for ever and put it all in NOW?"\r\n\r\nMaisie had never doubted she could be heroic for him. "Oh no!" It was as\r\nif she had been shocked at the bare thought. "We\'re just taking it as\r\nwe find it." She had a sudden inspiration, which she backed up with a\r\nsmile. "We\'re just seeing what we can afford." She had never yet in her\r\nlife made any claim for herself, but she hoped that this time, frankly,\r\nwhat she was doing would somehow be counted to her. Indeed she felt Sir\r\nClaude WAS counting it, though she was afraid to look at him--afraid she\r\nshould show him tears. She looked at Mrs. Wix; she reached her maximum.\r\n"I don\'t think I ought to be bad to Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\nShe heard, on this, a deep sound, something inarticulate and sweet,\r\nfrom Sir Claude; but tears were what Mrs. Wix didn\'t scruple to show.\r\n"Do you think you ought to be bad to ME?" The question was the more\r\ndisconcerting that Mrs. Wix\'s emotion didn\'t deprive her of the\r\nadvantage of her effect. "If you see that woman again you\'re lost!" she\r\ndeclared to their companion.\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked at the moony globe of the lamp; he seemed to see\r\nfor an instant what seeing Mrs. Beale would consist of. It was also\r\napparently from this vision that he drew strength to return: "Her\r\nsituation, by what has happened, is completely changed; and it\'s no\r\nuse your trying to prove to me that I needn\'t take any account of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"If you see that woman you\'re lost!" Mrs. Wix with greater force\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n"Do you think she\'ll not let me come back to you? My dear lady, I leave\r\nyou here, you and Maisie, as a hostage to fortune, and I promise you by\r\nall that\'s sacred that I shall be with you again at the very latest on\r\nSaturday. I provide you with funds; I install you in these lovely rooms;\r\nI arrange with the people here that you be treated with every attention\r\nand supplied with every luxury. The weather, after this, will mend; it\r\nwill be sure to be exquisite. You\'ll both be as free as air and you can\r\nroam all over the place and have tremendous larks. You shall have a\r\ncarriage to drive you; the whole house shall be at your call. You\'ll\r\nhave a magnificent position." He paused, he looked from one of his\r\ncompanions to the other as to see the impression he had made. Whether or\r\nno he judged it adequate he subjoined after a moment: "And you\'ll oblige\r\nme above all by not making a fuss."\r\n\r\nMaisie could only answer for the impression on herself, though indeed\r\nfrom the heart even of Mrs. Wix\'s rigour there floated to her sense a\r\nfaint fragrance of depraved concession. Maisie had her dumb word for the\r\nshow such a speech could make, for the irresistible charm it could take\r\nfrom his dazzling sincerity; and before she could do anything but blink\r\nat excess of light she heard this very word sound on Mrs. Wix\'s lips,\r\njust as if the poor lady had guessed it and wished, snatching it from\r\nher, to blight it like a crumpled flower. "You\'re dreadful, you\'re\r\nterrible, for you know but too well that it\'s not a small thing to me\r\nthat you should address me in terms that are princely!" Princely was\r\nwhat he stood there and looked and sounded; that was what Maisie for the\r\noccasion found herself reduced to simple worship of him for being. Yet\r\nstrange to say too, as Mrs. Wix went on, an echo rang within her that\r\nmatched the echo she had herself just produced. "How much you must WANT\r\nto see her to say such things as that and to be ready to do so much for\r\nthe poor little likes of Maisie and me! She has a hold on you, and you\r\nknow it, and you want to feel it again and--God knows, or at least _I_\r\ndo, what\'s your motive and desire--enjoy it once more and give yourself\r\nup to it! It doesn\'t matter if it\'s one day or three: enough is as good\r\nas a feast and the lovely time you\'ll have with her is something you\'re\r\nwilling to pay for! I dare say you\'d like me to believe that your pay is\r\nto get her to give you up; but that\'s a matter on which I strongly urge\r\nyou not to put down your money in advance. Give HER up first. Then pay\r\nher what you please!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude took this to the end, though there were things in it that\r\nmade him colour, called into his face more of the apprehension than\r\nMaisie had ever perceived there of a particular sort of shock. She had\r\nan odd sense that it was the first time she had seen any one but Mrs.\r\nWix really and truly scandalised, and this fed her inference, which grew\r\nand grew from moment to moment, that Mrs. Wix was proving more of a\r\nforce to reckon with than either of them had allowed so much room for.\r\nIt was true that, long before, she had obtained a "hold" of him, as\r\nshe called it, different in kind from that obtained by Mrs. Beale and\r\noriginally by her ladyship. But Maisie could quite feel with him now\r\nthat he had really not expected this advantage to be driven so home. Oh\r\nthey hadn\'t at all got to where Mrs. Wix would stop, for the next minute\r\nshe was driving harder than ever. It was the result of his saying with a\r\ncertain dryness, though so kindly that what most affected Maisie in it\r\nwas his patience: "My dear friend, it\'s simply a matter in which I must\r\njudge for myself. You\'ve judged FOR me, I know, a good deal, of late, in\r\na way that I appreciate, I assure you, down to the ground. But you can\'t\r\ndo it always; no one can do that for another, don\'t you see, in every\r\ncase. There are exceptions, particular cases that turn up and that are\r\nawfully delicate. It would be too easy if I could shift it all off on\r\nyou: it would be allowing you to incur an amount of responsibility that\r\nI should simply become quite ashamed of. You\'ll find, I\'m sure, that\r\nyou\'ll have quite as much as you\'ll enjoy if you\'ll be so good as to\r\naccept the situation as circumstances happen to make it for you and to\r\nstay here with our friend, till I rejoin you, on the footing of as much\r\npleasantness and as much comfort--and I think I have a right to add, to\r\nboth of you, of as much faith in ME--as possible."\r\n\r\nOh he was princely indeed: that came out more and more with every word\r\nhe said and with the particular way he said it, and Maisie could feel\r\nhis monitress stiffen almost with anguish against the increase of his\r\nspell and then hurl herself as a desperate defence from it into the\r\nquite confessed poorness of violence, of iteration. "You\'re afraid\r\nof her--afraid, afraid, afraid! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!" Mrs. Wix\r\nwailed it with a high quaver, then broke down into a long shudder of\r\nhelplessness and woe. The next minute she had flung herself again on\r\nthe lean sofa and had burst into a passion of tears.\r\n\r\nSir Claude stood and looked at her a moment; he shook his head slowly,\r\naltogether tenderly. "I\'ve already admitted it--I\'m in mortal terror;\r\nso we\'ll let that settle the question. I think you had best go to bed,"\r\nhe added; "you\'ve had a tremendous day and you must both be tired to\r\ndeath. I shall not expect you to concern yourselves in the morning\r\nwith my movements. There\'s an early boat on; I shall have cleared out\r\nbefore you\'re up; and I shall moreover have dealt directly and most\r\neffectively, I assure you, with the haughty but not quite hopeless Miss\r\nAsh." He turned to his stepdaughter as if at once to take leave of her\r\nand give her a sign of how, through all tension and friction, they were\r\nstill united in such a way that she at least needn\'t worry. "Maisie\r\nboy!"--he opened his arms to her. With her culpable lightness she flew\r\ninto them and, while he kissed her, chose the soft method of silence to\r\nsatisfy him, the silence that after battles of talk was the best balm\r\nshe could offer his wounds. They held each other long enough to reaffirm\r\nintensely their vows; after which they were almost forced apart by Mrs.\r\nWix\'s jumping to her feet.\r\n\r\nHer jump, either with a quick return or with a final lapse of courage,\r\nwas also to supplication almost abject. "I beseech you not to take a\r\nstep so miserable and so fatal. I know her but too well, even if you\r\njeer at me for saying it; little as I\'ve seen her I know her, I know\r\nher. I know what she\'ll do--I see it as I stand here. Since you\'re\r\nafraid of her it\'s the mercy of heaven. Don\'t, for God\'s sake, be afraid\r\nto show it, to profit by it and to arrive at the very safety that it\r\ngives you. I\'M not afraid of her, I assure you; you must already have\r\nseen for yourself that there\'s nothing I\'m afraid of now. Let me go to\r\nher--I\'LL settle her and I\'ll take that woman back without a hair of\r\nher touched. Let me put in the two or three days--let me wind up the\r\nconnexion. You stay here with Maisie, with the carriage and the larks\r\nand the luxury; then I\'ll return to you and we\'ll go off together--we\'ll\r\nlive together without a cloud. Take me, take me," she went on and\r\non--the tide of her eloquence was high. "Here I am; I know what I am\r\nand what I ain\'t; but I say boldly to the face of you both that I\'ll do\r\nbetter for you, far, than ever she\'ll even try to. I say it to yours,\r\nSir Claude, even though I owe you the very dress on my back and the very\r\nshoes on my feet. I owe you everything--that\'s just the reason; and to\r\npay it back, in profusion, what can that be but what I want? Here I am,\r\nhere I am!"--she spread herself into an exhibition that, combined with\r\nher intensity and her decorations, appeared to suggest her for strange\r\noffices and devotions, for ridiculous replacements and substitutions.\r\nShe manipulated her gown as she talked, she insisted on the items of\r\nher debt. "I have nothing of my own, I know--no money, no clothes, no\r\nappearance, no anything, nothing but my hold of this little one truth,\r\nwhich is all in the world I can bribe you with: that the pair of you are\r\nmore to me than all besides, and that if you\'ll let me help you and save\r\nyou, make what you both want possible in the one way it CAN be, why,\r\nI\'ll work myself to the bone in your service!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude wavered there without an answer to this magnificent appeal;\r\nhe plainly cast about for one, and in no small agitation and pain. He\r\naddressed himself in his quest, however, only to vague quarters until he\r\nmet again, as he so frequently and actively met it, the more than filial\r\ngaze of his intelligent little charge. That gave him--poor plastic and\r\ndependent male--his issue. If she was still a child she was yet of\r\nthe sex that could help him out. He signified as much by a renewed\r\ninvitation to an embrace. She freshly sprang to him and again they\r\ninaudibly conversed. "Be nice to her, be nice to her," he at last\r\ndistinctly articulated; "be nice to her as you\'ve not even been to ME!"\r\nOn which, without another look at Mrs. Wix, he somehow got out of the\r\nroom, leaving Maisie under the slight oppression of these words as well\r\nas of the idea that he had unmistakeably once more dodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery single thing he had prophesied came so true that it was after all\r\nno more than fair to expect quite as much for what he had as good as\r\npromised. His pledges they could verify to the letter, down to his very\r\nguarantee that a way would be found with Miss Ash. Roused in the summer\r\ndawn and vehemently squeezed by that interesting exile, Maisie fell back\r\nupon her couch with a renewed appreciation of his policy, a memento of\r\nwhich, when she rose later on to dress, glittered at her from the carpet\r\nin the shape of a sixpence that had overflowed from Susan\'s pride of\r\npossession. Sixpences really, for the forty-eight hours that followed,\r\nseemed to abound in her life; she fancifully computed the number of them\r\nrepresented by such a period of "larks." The number was not kept down,\r\nshe presently noticed, by any scheme of revenge for Sir Claude\'s flight\r\nwhich should take on Mrs. Wix\'s part the form of a refusal to avail\r\nherself of the facilities he had so bravely ordered. It was in fact\r\nimpossible to escape them; it was in the good lady\'s own phrase\r\nridiculous to go on foot when you had a carriage prancing at the door.\r\nEverything about them pranced: the very waiters even as they presented\r\nthe dishes to which, from a similar sense of the absurdity of\r\nperversity, Mrs. Wix helped herself with a freedom that spoke to Maisie\r\nquite as much of her depletion as of her logic. Her appetite was a sign\r\nto her companion of a great many things and testified no less on the\r\nwhole to her general than to her particular condition. She had arrears\r\nof dinner to make up, and it was touching that in a dinnerless state\r\nher moral passion should have burned so clear. She partook largely as\r\na refuge from depression, and yet the opportunity to partake was just\r\na mark of the sinister symptoms that depressed her. The affair was\r\nin short a combat, in which the baser element triumphed, between her\r\nrefusal to be bought off and her consent to be clothed and fed. It was\r\nnot at any rate to be gainsaid that there was comfort for her in the\r\ndevelopments of France; comfort so great as to leave Maisie free to take\r\nwith her all the security for granted and brush all the danger aside.\r\nThat was the way to carry out in detail Sir Claude\'s injunction to be\r\n"nice"; that was the way, as well, to look, with her, in a survey of the\r\npleasures of life abroad, straight over the head of any doubt.\r\n\r\nThey shrank at last, all doubts, as the weather cleared up: it had an\r\nimmense effect on them and became quite as lovely as Sir Claude had\r\nengaged. This seemed to have put him so into the secret of things, and\r\nthe joy of the world so waylaid the steps of his friends, that little by\r\nlittle the spirit of hope filled the air and finally took possession of\r\nthe scene. To drive on the long cliff was splendid, but it was perhaps\r\nbetter still to creep in the shade--for the sun was strong--along the\r\nmany-coloured and many-odoured port and through the streets in which, to\r\nEnglish eyes, everything that was the same was a mystery and everything\r\nthat was different a joke. Best of all was to continue the creep up the\r\nlong Grand\' Rue to the gate of the _haute ville_ and, passing beneath\r\nit, mount to the quaint and crooked rampart, with its rows of trees,\r\nits quiet corners and friendly benches where brown old women in such\r\nwhite-frilled caps and such long gold earrings sat and knitted or\r\nsnoozed, its little yellow-faced houses that looked like the homes of\r\nmisers or of priests and its dark ch\xe2teau where small soldiers lounged\r\non the bridge that stretched across an empty moat and military washing\r\nhung from the windows of towers. This was a part of the place that could\r\nlead Maisie to enquire if it didn\'t just meet one\'s idea of the middle\r\nages; and since it was rather a satisfaction than a shock to perceive,\r\nand not for the first time, the limits in Mrs. Wix\'s mind of the\r\nhistoric imagination, that only added one more to the variety of kinds\r\nof insight that she felt it her own present mission to show. They sat\r\ntogether on the old grey bastion; they looked down on the little new\r\ntown which seemed to them quite as old, and across at the great dome and\r\nthe high gilt Virgin of the church that, as they gathered, was famous\r\nand that pleased them by its unlikeness to any place in which they\r\nhad worshipped. They wandered in this temple afterwards and Mrs. Wix\r\nconfessed that for herself she had probably made a fatal mistake early\r\nin life in not being a Catholic. Her confession in its turn caused\r\nMaisie to wonder rather interestedly what degree of lateness it was\r\nthat shut the door against an escape from such an error. They went back\r\nto the rampart on the second morning--the spot on which they appeared\r\nto have come furthest in the journey that was to separate them from\r\neverything objectionable in the past: it gave them afresh the impression\r\nthat had most to do with their having worked round to a confidence that\r\non Maisie\'s part was determined and that she could see to be on her\r\ncompanion\'s desperate. She had had for many hours the sense of showing\r\nMrs. Wix so much that she was comparatively slow to become conscious\r\nof being at the same time the subject of a like aim. The business went\r\nthe faster, however, from the moment she got her glimpse of it; it then\r\nfell into its place in her general, her habitual view of the particular\r\nphenomenon that, had she felt the need of words for it, she might have\r\ncalled her personal relation to her knowledge. This relation had never\r\nbeen so lively as during the time she waited with her old governess for\r\nSir Claude\'s reappearance, and what made it so was exactly that Mrs. Wix\r\nstruck her as having a new suspicion of it. Mrs. Wix had never yet had a\r\nsuspicion--this was certain--so calculated to throw her pupil, in spite\r\nof the closer union of such adventurous hours, upon the deep defensive.\r\nHer pupil made out indeed as many marvels as she had made out on the\r\nrush to Folkestone; and if in Sir Claude\'s company on that occasion Mrs.\r\nWix was the constant implication, so in Mrs. Wix\'s, during these hours,\r\nSir Claude was--and most of all through long pauses--the perpetual, the\r\ninsurmountable theme. It all took them back to the first flush of his\r\nmarriage and to the place he held in the schoolroom at that crisis of\r\nlove and pain; only he had himself blown to a much bigger balloon the\r\nlarge consciousness he then filled out.\r\n\r\nThey went through it all again, and indeed while the interval dragged\r\nby the very weight of its charm they went, in spite of defences and\r\nsuspicions, through everything. Their intensified clutch of the future\r\nthrobbed like a clock ticking seconds; but this was a timepiece that\r\ninevitably, as well, at the best, rang occasionally a portentous hour.\r\nOh there were several of these, and two or three of the worst on the old\r\ncity-wall where everything else so made for peace. There was nothing\r\nin the world Maisie more wanted than to be as nice to Mrs. Wix as Sir\r\nClaude had desired; but it was exactly because this fell in with her\r\ninveterate instinct of keeping the peace that the instinct itself\r\nwas quickened. From the moment it was quickened, however, it found\r\nother work, and that was how, to begin with, she produced the very\r\ncomplication she most sought to avert. What she had essentially done,\r\nthese days, had been to read the unspoken into the spoken; so that thus,\r\nwith accumulations, it had become more definite to her that the unspoken\r\nwas, unspeakably, the completeness of the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale. There\r\nwere times when every minute that Sir Claude stayed away was like a nail\r\nin Mrs. Beale\'s coffin. That brought back to Maisie--it was a roundabout\r\nway--the beauty and antiquity of her connexion with the flower of the\r\nOvermores as well as that lady\'s own grace and charm, her peculiar\r\nprettiness and cleverness and even her peculiar tribulations. A hundred\r\nthings hummed at the back of her head, but two of these were simple\r\nenough. Mrs. Beale was by the way, after all, just her stepmother\r\nand her relative. She was just--and partly for that very reason--Sir\r\nClaude\'s greatest intimate ("lady-intimate" was Maisie\'s term) so that\r\nwhat together they were on Mrs. Wix\'s prescription to give up and break\r\nshort off with was for one of them his particular favourite and for the\r\nother her father\'s wife. Strangely, indescribably her perception of\r\nreasons kept pace with her sense of trouble; but there was something in\r\nher that, without a supreme effort not to be shabby, couldn\'t take the\r\nreasons for granted. What it comes to perhaps for ourselves is that,\r\ndisinherited and denuded as we have seen her, there still lingered in\r\nher life an echo of parental influence--she was still reminiscent of\r\none of the sacred lessons of home. It was the only one she retained,\r\nbut luckily she retained it with force. She enjoyed in a word an\r\nineffaceable view of the fact that there were things papa called mamma\r\nand mamma called papa a low sneak for doing or for not doing. Now this\r\nrich memory gave her a name that she dreaded to invite to the lips of\r\nMrs. Beale: she should personally wince so just to hear it. The very\r\nsweetness of the foreign life she was steeped in added with each hour\r\nof Sir Claude\'s absence to the possibility of such pangs. She watched\r\nbeside Mrs. Wix the great golden Madonna, and one of the ear-ringed old\r\nwomen who had been sitting at the end of their bench got up and pottered\r\naway. "Adieu mesdames!" said the old woman in a little cracked civil\r\nvoice--a demonstration by which our friends were so affected that they\r\nbobbed up and almost curtseyed to her. They subsided again, and it was\r\nshortly after, in a summer hum of French insects and a phase of almost\r\nsomnolent reverie, that Maisie most had the vision of what it was to\r\nshut out from such a perspective so appealing a participant. It had not\r\nyet appeared so vast as at that moment, this prospect of statues shining\r\nin the blue and of courtesy in romantic forms.\r\n\r\n"Why after all should we have to choose between you? Why shouldn\'t we\r\nbe four?" she finally demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix gave the jerk of a sleeper awakened or the start even of one\r\nwho hears a bullet whiz at the flag of truce. Her stupefaction at\r\nsuch a breach of the peace delayed for a moment her answer. "Four\r\nimproprieties, do you mean? Because two of us happen to be decent\r\npeople! Do I gather you to wish that I should stay on with you even\r\nif that woman IS capable--?"\r\n\r\nMaisie took her up before she could further phrase Mrs. Beale\'s\r\ncapability. "Stay on as MY companion--yes. Stay on as just what you\r\nwere at mamma\'s. Mrs. Beale WOULD let you!" the child said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix had by this time fairly sprung to her arms. "And who, I\'d like\r\nto know, would let Mrs. Beale? Do you mean, little unfortunate, that YOU\r\nwould?"\r\n\r\n"Why not, if now she\'s free?"\r\n\r\n"Free? Are you imitating HIM? Well, if Sir Claude\'s old enough to know\r\nbetter, upon my word I think it\'s right to treat you as if you also\r\nwere. You\'ll have to, at any rate--to know better--if that\'s the line\r\nyou\'re proposing to take." Mrs. Wix had never been so harsh; but on the\r\nother hand Maisie could guess that she herself had never appeared so\r\nwanton. What was underlying, however, rather overawed than angered her;\r\nshe felt she could still insist--not for contradiction, but for ultimate\r\ncalm. Her wantonness meanwhile continued to work upon her friend, who\r\ncaught again, on the rebound, the sound of deepest provocation. "Free,\r\nfree, free? If she\'s as free as YOU are, my dear, she\'s free enough, to\r\nbe sure!"\r\n\r\n"As I am?"--Maisie, after reflexion and despite whatever of portentous\r\nthis seemed to convey, risked a critical echo.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Wix, "nobody, you know, is free to commit a crime."\r\n\r\n"A crime!" The word had come out in a way that made the child sound it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"You\'d commit as great a one as their own--and so should I--if we were\r\nto condone their immorality by our presence."\r\n\r\nMaisie waited a little; this seemed so fiercely conclusive. "Why is it\r\nimmorality?" she nevertheless presently enquired.\r\n\r\nHer companion now turned upon her with a reproach softer because it was\r\nsomehow deeper. "You\'re too unspeakable! Do you know what we\'re talking\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\nIn the interest of ultimate calm Maisie felt that she must be above all\r\nclear. "Certainly; about their taking advantage of their freedom."\r\n\r\n"Well, to do what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, to live with us."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix\'s laugh, at this, was literally wild. "\'Us?\' Thank you!"\r\n\r\n"Then to live with ME."\r\n\r\nThe words made her friend jump. "You give me up? You break with me for\r\never? You turn me into the street?"\r\n\r\nMaisie, though gasping a little, bore up under the rain of challenges.\r\n"Those, it seems to me, are the things you do to ME."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix made little of her valour. "I can promise you that, whatever\r\nI do, I shall never let you out of my sight! You ask me why it\'s\r\nimmorality when you\'ve seen with your own eyes that Sir Claude has felt\r\nit to be so to that dire extent that, rather than make you face the\r\nshame of it, he has for months kept away from you altogether? Is it any\r\nmore difficult to see that the first time he tries to do his duty he\r\nwashes his hands of HER--takes you straight away from her?"\r\n\r\nMaisie turned this over, but more for apparent consideration than from\r\nany impulse to yield too easily. "Yes, I see what you mean. But at\r\nthat time they weren\'t free." She felt Mrs. Wix rear up again at the\r\noffensive word, but she succeeded in touching her with a remonstrant\r\nhand. "I don\'t think you know how free they\'ve become."\r\n\r\n"I know, I believe, at least as much as you do!"\r\n\r\nMaisie felt a delicacy but overcame it. "About the Countess?"\r\n\r\n"Your father\'s--temptress?" Mrs. Wix gave her a sidelong squint.\r\n"Perfectly. She pays him!"\r\n\r\n"Oh DOES she?" At this the child\'s countenance fell: it seemed to give a\r\nreason for papa\'s behaviour and place it in a more favourable light. She\r\nwished to be just. "I don\'t say she\'s not generous. She was so to me."\r\n\r\n"How, to you?"\r\n\r\n"She gave me a lot of money."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix stared. "And pray what did you do with a lot of money?"\r\n\r\n"I gave it to Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\n"And what did Mrs. Beale do with it?"\r\n\r\n"She sent it back."\r\n\r\n"To the Countess? Gammon!" said Mrs. Wix. She disposed of that plea as\r\neffectually as Susan Ash.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care!" Maisie replied. "What I mean is that you don\'t\r\nknow about the rest."\r\n\r\n"The rest? What rest?"\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered how she could best put it. "Papa kept me there an hour."\r\n\r\n"I do know--Sir Claude told me. Mrs. Beale had told him."\r\n\r\nMaisie looked incredulity. "How could she--when I didn\'t speak of it?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix was mystified. "Speak of what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of her being so frightful."\r\n\r\n"The Countess? Of course she\'s frightful!" Mrs. Wix returned. After a\r\nmoment she added: "That\'s why she pays him."\r\n\r\nMaisie pondered. "It\'s the best thing about her then--if she gives him\r\nas much as she gave ME!"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s not the best thing about HIM! Or rather perhaps it IS too!"\r\nMrs. Wix subjoined.\r\n\r\n"But she\'s awful--really and truly," Maisie went on.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix arrested her. "You needn\'t go into details!" It was visibly at\r\nvariance with this injunction that she yet enquired: "How does that make\r\nit any better?"\r\n\r\n"Their living with me? Why for the Countess--and for her whiskers!--he\r\nhas put me off on them. I understood him," Maisie profoundly said.\r\n\r\n"I hope then he understood you. It\'s more than I do!" Mrs. Wix admitted.\r\n\r\nThis was a real challenge to be plainer, and our young lady immediately\r\nbecame so. "I mean it isn\'t a crime."\r\n\r\n"Why then did Sir Claude steal you away?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t steal--he only borrowed me. I knew it wasn\'t for long,"\r\nMaisie audaciously professed.\r\n\r\n"You must allow me to reply to that," cried Mrs. Wix, "that you knew\r\nnothing of the sort, and that you rather basely failed to back me up\r\nlast night when you pretended so plump that you did! You hoped in fact,\r\nexactly as much as I did and as in my senseless passion I even hope now,\r\nthat this may be the beginning of better things."\r\n\r\nOh yes, Mrs. Wix was indeed, for the first time, sharp; so that there\r\nat last stirred in our heroine the sense not so much of being proved\r\ndisingenuous as of being precisely accused of the meanness that had\r\nbrought everything down on her through her very desire to shake herself\r\nclear of it. She suddenly felt herself swell with a passion of protest.\r\n"I never, NEVER hoped I wasn\'t going again to see Mrs. Beale! I didn\'t,\r\nI didn\'t, I didn\'t!" she repeated. Mrs. Wix bounced about with a force\r\nof rejoinder of which she also felt that she must anticipate the\r\nconcussion and which, though the good lady was evidently charged to the\r\nbrim, hung fire long enough to give time for an aggravation. "She\'s\r\nbeautiful and I love her! I love her and she\'s beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m hideous and you hate ME?" Mrs. Wix fixed her a moment, then\r\ncaught herself up. "I won\'t embitter you by absolutely accusing you of\r\nthat; though, as for my being hideous, it\'s hardly the first time I\'ve\r\nbeen told so! I know it so well that even if I haven\'t whiskers--have\r\nI?--I dare say there are other ways in which the Countess is a Venus to\r\nme! My pretensions must therefore seem to you monstrous--which comes to\r\nthe same thing as your not liking me. But do you mean to go so far as to\r\ntell me that you WANT to live with them in their sin?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I want, you know what I want!"--Maisie spoke with the\r\nshudder of rising tears.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; you want me to be as bad as yourself! Well, I won\'t. There!\r\nMrs. Beale\'s as bad as your father!" Mrs. Wix went on.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not!--she\'s not!" her pupil almost shrieked in retort.\r\n\r\n"You mean because Sir Claude at least has beauty and wit and grace? But\r\nhe pays just as the Countess pays!" Mrs. Wix, who now rose as she spoke,\r\nfairly revealed a latent cynicism.\r\n\r\nIt raised Maisie also to her feet; her companion had walked off a few\r\nsteps and paused. The two looked at each other as they had never looked,\r\nand Mrs. Wix seemed to flaunt there in her finery. "Then doesn\'t he pay\r\nYOU too?" her unhappy charge demanded.\r\n\r\nAt this she bounded in her place. "Oh you incredible little waif!"\r\nShe brought it out with a wail of violence; after which, with another\r\nconvulsion, she marched straight away.\r\n\r\nMaisie dropped back on the bench and burst into sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing so dreadful of course could be final or even for many minutes\r\nprolonged: they rushed together again too soon for either to feel that\r\neither had kept it up, and though they went home in silence it was with\r\na vivid perception for Maisie that her companion\'s hand had closed upon\r\nher. That hand had shown altogether, these twenty-four hours, a new\r\ncapacity for closing, and one of the truths the child could least resist\r\nwas that a certain greatness had now come to Mrs. Wix. The case was\r\nindeed that the quality of her motive surpassed the sharpness of her\r\nangles; both the combination and the singularity of which things, when\r\nin the afternoon they used the carriage, Maisie could borrow from the\r\ncontemplative hush of their grandeur the freedom to feel to the utmost.\r\nShe still bore the mark of the tone in which her friend had thrown out\r\nthat threat of never losing sight of her. This friend had been converted\r\nin short from feebleness to force; and it was the light of her new\r\nauthority that showed from how far she had come. The threat in question,\r\nsharply exultant, might have produced defiance; but before anything so\r\nugly could happen another process had insidiously forestalled it. The\r\nmoment at which this process had begun to mature was that of Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nbreaking out with a dignity attuned to their own apartments and with an\r\nadvantage now measurably gained. They had ordered coffee after luncheon,\r\nin the spirit of Sir Claude\'s provision, and it was served to them while\r\nthey awaited their equipage in the white and gold saloon. It was flanked\r\nmoreover with a couple of liqueurs, and Maisie felt that Sir Claude\r\ncould scarce have been taken more at his word had it been followed\r\nby anecdotes and cigarettes. The influence of these luxuries was\r\nat any rate in the air. It seemed to her while she tiptoed at the\r\nchimney-glass, pulling on her gloves and with a motion of her head\r\nshaking a feather into place, to have had something to do with Mrs.\r\nWix\'s suddenly saying: "Haven\'t you really and truly ANY moral sense?"\r\n\r\nMaisie was aware that her answer, though it brought her down to her\r\nheels, was vague even to imbecility, and that this was the first time\r\nshe had appeared to practise with Mrs. Wix an intellectual inaptitude to\r\nmeet her--the infirmity to which she had owed so much success with papa\r\nand mamma. The appearance did her injustice, for it was not less through\r\nher candour than through her playfellow\'s pressure that after this the\r\nidea of a moral sense mainly coloured their intercourse. She began, the\r\npoor child, with scarcely knowing what it was; but it proved something\r\nthat, with scarce an outward sign save her surrender to the swing of the\r\ncarriage, she could, before they came back from their drive, strike up a\r\nsort of acquaintance with. The beauty of the day only deepened, and the\r\nsplendour of the afternoon sea, and the haze of the far headlands, and\r\nthe taste of the sweet air. It was the coachman indeed who, smiling and\r\ncracking his whip, turning in his place, pointing to invisible objects\r\nand uttering unintelligible sounds--all, our tourists recognised, strict\r\nfeatures of a social order principally devoted to language: it was this\r\npolite person, I say, who made their excursion fall so much short that\r\ntheir return left them still a stretch of the long daylight and an hour\r\nthat, at his obliging suggestion, they spent on foot by the shining\r\nsands. Maisie had seen the _plage_ the day before with Sir Claude, but\r\nthat was a reason the more for showing on the spot to Mrs. Wix that it\r\nwas, as she said, another of the places on her list and of the things of\r\nwhich she knew the French name. The bathers, so late, were absent and\r\nthe tide was low; the sea-pools twinkled in the sunset and there were\r\ndry places as well, where they could sit again and admire and expatiate:\r\na circumstance that, while they listened to the lap of the waves, gave\r\nMrs. Wix a fresh support for her challenge. "Have you absolutely none at\r\nall?"\r\n\r\nShe had no need now, as to the question itself at least, to be specific;\r\nthat on the other hand was the eventual result of their quiet conjoined\r\napprehension of the thing that--well, yes, since they must face\r\nit--Maisie absolutely and appallingly had so little of. This marked more\r\nparticularly the moment of the child\'s perceiving that her friend had\r\nrisen to a level which might--till superseded at all events--pass almost\r\nfor sublime. Nothing more remarkable had taken place in the first heat\r\nof her own departure, no act of perception less to be overtraced by our\r\nrough method, than her vision, the rest of that Boulogne day, of the\r\nmanner in which she figured. I so despair of courting her noiseless\r\nmental footsteps here that I must crudely give you my word for its being\r\nfrom this time forward a picture literally present to her. Mrs. Wix\r\nsaw her as a little person knowing so extraordinarily much that, for\r\nthe account to be taken of it, what she still didn\'t know would be\r\nridiculous if it hadn\'t been embarrassing. Mrs. Wix was in truth more\r\nthan ever qualified to meet embarrassment; I am not sure that Maisie had\r\nnot even a dim discernment of the queer law of her own life that made\r\nher educate to that sort of proficiency those elders with whom she was\r\nconcerned. She promoted, as it were, their development; nothing could\r\nhave been more marked for instance than her success in promoting Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s. She judged that if her whole history, for Mrs. Wix, had been\r\nthe successive stages of her knowledge, so the very climax of the\r\nconcatenation would, in the same view, be the stage at which the\r\nknowledge should overflow. As she was condemned to know more and more,\r\nhow could it logically stop before she should know Most? It came to her\r\nin fact as they sat there on the sands that she was distinctly on the\r\nroad to know Everything. She had not had governesses for nothing: what\r\nin the world had she ever done but learn and learn and learn? She looked\r\nat the pink sky with a placid foreboding that she soon should have\r\nlearnt All. They lingered in the flushed air till at last it turned\r\nto grey and she seemed fairly to receive new information from every\r\nbrush of the breeze. By the time they moved homeward it was as if this\r\ninevitability had become for Mrs. Wix a long, tense cord, twitched by\r\na nervous hand, on which the valued pearls of intelligence were to be\r\nneatly strung.\r\n\r\nIn the evening upstairs they had another strange sensation, as to which\r\nMaisie couldn\'t afterwards have told you whether it was bang in the\r\nmiddle or quite at the beginning that her companion sounded with fresh\r\nemphasis the note of the moral sense. What mattered was merely that she\r\ndid exclaim, and again, as at first appeared, most disconnectedly: "God\r\nhelp me, it does seem to peep out!" Oh the queer confusions that had\r\nwooed it at last to such peeping! None so queer, however, as the words\r\nof woe, and it might verily be said of rage, in which the poor lady\r\nbewailed the tragic end of her own rich ignorance. There was a point at\r\nwhich she seized the child and hugged her as close as in the old days of\r\npartings and returns; at which she was visibly at a loss how to make up\r\nto such a victim for such contaminations: appealing, as to what she had\r\ndone and was doing, in bewilderment, in explanation, in supplication,\r\nfor reassurance, for pardon and even outright for pity.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I\'ve said to you, my own: I don\'t know what I\'m\r\nsaying or what the turn you\'ve given my life has rendered me, heaven\r\nforgive me, capable of saying. Have I lost all delicacy, all decency,\r\nall measure of how far and how bad? It seems to me mostly that I have,\r\nthough I\'m the last of whom you would ever have thought it. I\'ve just\r\ndone it for YOU, precious--not to lose you, which would have been worst\r\nof all: so that I\'ve had to pay with my own innocence, if you do laugh!\r\nfor clinging to you and keeping you. Don\'t let me pay for nothing; don\'t\r\nlet me have been thrust for nothing into such horrors and such shames. I\r\nnever knew anything about them and I never wanted to know! Now I know\r\ntoo much, too much!" the poor woman lamented and groaned. "I know so\r\nmuch that with hearing such talk I ask myself where I am; and with\r\nuttering it too, which is worse, say to myself that I\'m far, too far,\r\nfrom where I started! I ask myself what I should have thought with my\r\nlost one if I had heard myself cross the line. There are lines I\'ve\r\ncrossed with YOU where I should have fancied I had come to a pretty\r\npass--" She gasped at the mere supposition. "I\'ve gone from one thing to\r\nanother, and all for the real love of you; and now what would any one\r\nsay--I mean any one but THEM--if they were to hear the way I go on? I\'ve\r\nhad to keep up with you, haven\'t I?--and therefore what could I do less\r\nthan look to you to keep up with ME? But it\'s not THEM that are the\r\nworst--by which I mean to say it\'s not HIM: it\'s your dreadfully base\r\npapa and the one person in the world whom he could have found, I do\r\nbelieve--and she\'s not the Countess, duck--wickeder than himself. While\r\nthey were about it at any rate, since they WERE ruining you, they might\r\nhave done it so as to spare an honest woman. Then I shouldn\'t have had\r\nto do whatever it is that\'s the worst: throw up at you the badness you\r\nhaven\'t taken in, or find my advantage in the vileness you HAVE! What I\r\ndid lose patience at this morning was at how it was that without your\r\nseeming to condemn--for you didn\'t, you remember!--you yet did seem to\r\nKNOW. Thank God, in his mercy, at last, IF you do!"\r\n\r\nThe night, this time, was warm, and one of the windows stood open to the\r\nsmall balcony over the rail of which, on coming back from dinner, Maisie\r\nhad hung a long time in the enjoyment of the chatter, the lights, the\r\nlife of the quay made brilliant by the season and the hour. Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nrequirements had drawn her in from this pasture and Mrs. Wix\'s embrace\r\nhad detained her even though midway in the outpouring her confusion\r\nand sympathy had permitted, or rather had positively helped, her to\r\ndisengage herself. But the casement was still wide, the spectacle, the\r\npleasure were still there, and from her place in the room, which, with\r\nits polished floor and its panels of elegance, was lighted from without\r\nmore than from within, the child could still take account of them. She\r\nappeared to watch and listen; after which she answered Mrs. Wix with a\r\nquestion. "If I do know--?"\r\n\r\n"If you do condemn." The correction was made with some austerity.\r\n\r\nIt had the effect of causing Maisie to heave a vague sigh of oppression\r\nand then after an instant and as if under cover of this ambiguity pass\r\nout again upon the balcony. She hung again over the rail; she felt the\r\nsummer night; she dropped down into the manners of France. There was\r\na caf\xe9 below the hotel, before which, with little chairs and tables,\r\npeople sat on a space enclosed by plants in tubs; and the impression was\r\nenriched by the flash of the white aprons of waiters and the music of a\r\nman and a woman who, from beyond the precinct, sent up the strum of a\r\nguitar and the drawl of a song about "amour." Maisie knew what "amour"\r\nmeant too, and wondered if Mrs. Wix did: Mrs. Wix remained within, as\r\nstill as a mouse and perhaps not reached by the performance. After\r\na while, but not till the musicians had ceased and begun to circulate\r\nwith a little plate, her pupil came back to her. "IS it a crime?" Maisie\r\nthen asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix was as prompt as if she had been crouching in a lair. "Branded\r\nby the Bible."\r\n\r\n"Well, he won\'t commit a crime."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked at her gloomily. "He\'s committing one now."\r\n\r\n"Now?"\r\n\r\n"In being with her."\r\n\r\nMaisie had it on her tongue\'s end to return once more: "But now he\'s\r\nfree." She remembered, however, in time that one of the things she had\r\nknown for the last entire hour was that this made no difference. After\r\nthat, and as if to turn the right way, she was on the point of a blind\r\ndash, a weak reversion to the reminder that it might make a difference,\r\nmight diminish the crime for Mrs. Beale; till such a reflexion was in\r\nits order also quashed by the visibility in Mrs. Wix\'s face of the\r\ncollapse produced by her inference from her pupil\'s manner that after\r\nall her pains her pupil didn\'t even yet adequately understand. Never so\r\nmuch as when confronted had Maisie wanted to understand, and all her\r\nthought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something\r\nwhich should be a disproof of her simplicity. "Just TRUST me, dear;\r\nthat\'s all!"--she came out finally with that; and it was perhaps a good\r\nsign of her action that with a long, impartial moan Mrs. Wix floated her\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nThere was no letter the next morning from Sir Claude--which Mrs. Wix let\r\nout that she deemed the worst of omens; yet it was just for the quieter\r\ncommunion they so got with him that, when after the coffee and rolls\r\nwhich made them more foreign than ever, it came to going forth for fresh\r\ndrafts upon his credit they wandered again up the hill to the rampart\r\ninstead of plunging into distraction with the crowd on the sands or into\r\nthe sea with the semi-nude bathers. They gazed once more at their gilded\r\nVirgin; they sank once more upon their battered bench; they felt once\r\nmore their distance from the Regent\'s Park. At last Mrs. Wix became\r\ndefinite about their friend\'s silence. "He IS afraid of her! She has\r\nforbidden him to write." The fact of his fear Maisie already knew; but\r\nher companion\'s mention of it had at this moment two unexpected results.\r\nThe first was her wondering in dumb remonstrance how Mrs. Wix, with\r\na devotion not after all inferior to her own, could put into such an\r\nallusion such a grimness of derision; the second was that she found\r\nherself suddenly drop into a deeper view of it. She too had been afraid,\r\nas we have seen, of the people of whom Sir Claude was afraid, and by\r\nthat law she had had her due measure of latest apprehension of Mrs.\r\nBeale. What occurred at present, however, was that, whereas this\r\nsympathy appeared vain as for him, the ground of it loomed dimly as a\r\nreason for selfish alarm. That uneasiness had not carried her far before\r\nMrs. Wix spoke again and with an abruptness so great as almost to seem\r\nirrelevant. "Has it never occurred to you to be jealous of her?"\r\n\r\nIt never had in the least; yet the words were scarce in the air before\r\nMaisie had jumped at them. She held them well, she looked at them hard;\r\nat last she brought out with an assurance which there was no one, alas,\r\nbut herself to admire: "Well, yes--since you ask me." She debated, then\r\ncontinued: "Lots of times!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix glared askance an instant; such approval as her look expressed\r\nwas not wholly unqualified. It expressed at any rate something that\r\npresumably had to do with her saying once more: "Yes. He\'s afraid of\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMaisie heard, and it had afresh its effect on her even through the\r\nblur of the attention now required by the possibility of that idea of\r\njealousy--a possibility created only by her feeling she had thus found\r\nthe way to show she was not simple. It struck out of Mrs. Wix that\r\nthis lady still believed her moral sense to be interested and feigned;\r\nso what could be such a gage of her sincerity as a peep of the most\r\nrestless of the passions? Such a revelation would baffle discouragement,\r\nand discouragement was in fact so baffled that, helped in some degree\r\nby the mere intensity of their need to hope, which also, according to\r\nits nature, sprang from the dark portent of the absent letter, the real\r\npitch of their morning was reached by the note, not of mutual scrutiny,\r\nbut of unprecedented frankness. There were broodings indeed and\r\nsilences, and Maisie sank deeper into the vision that for her friend\r\nshe was, at the most, superficial, and that also, positively, she was\r\nthe more so the more she tried to appear complete. Was the sum of all\r\nknowledge only to know how little in this presence one would ever reach\r\nit? The answer to that question luckily lost itself in the brightness\r\nsuffusing the scene as soon as Maisie had thrown out in regard to Mrs.\r\nBeale such a remark as she had never dreamed she should live to make.\r\n"If I thought she was unkind to him--I don\'t know WHAT I should do!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix dropped one of her squints; she even confirmed it by a wild\r\ngrunt. "I know what _I_ should!"\r\n\r\nMaisie at this felt that she lagged. "Well, I can think of ONE thing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix more directly challenged her. "What is it then?"\r\n\r\nMaisie met her expression as if it were a game with forfeits for\r\nwinking. "I\'d KILL her!" That at least, she hoped as she looked away,\r\nwould guarantee her moral sense. She looked away, but her companion said\r\nnothing for so long that she at last turned her head again. Then she saw\r\nthe straighteners all blurred with tears which after a little seemed to\r\nhave sprung from her own eyes. There were tears in fact on both sides of\r\nthe spectacles, and they were even so thick that it was presently all\r\nMaisie could do to make out through them that slowly, finally Mrs. Wix\r\nput forth a hand. It was the material pressure that settled this and\r\neven at the end of some minutes more things besides. It settled in its\r\nown way one thing in particular, which, though often, between them,\r\nheaven knew, hovered round and hung over, was yet to be established\r\nwithout the shadow of an attenuating smile. Oh there was no gleam of\r\nlevity, as little of humour as of deprecation, in the long time they now\r\nsat together or in the way in which at some unmeasured point of it Mrs.\r\nWix became distinct enough for her own dignity and yet not loud enough\r\nfor the snoozing old women.\r\n\r\n"I adore him. I adore him."\r\n\r\nMaisie took it well in; so well that in a moment more she would have\r\nanswered profoundly: "So do I." But before that moment passed something\r\ntook place that brought other words to her lips; nothing more, very\r\npossibly, than the closer consciousness in her hand of the significance\r\nof Mrs. Wix\'s. Their hands remained linked in unutterable sign of their\r\nunion, and what Maisie at last said was simply and serenely: "Oh I\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\nTheir hands were so linked and their union was so confirmed that it took\r\nthe far deep note of a bell, borne to them on the summer air, to call\r\nthem back to a sense of hours and proprieties. They had touched bottom\r\nand melted together, but they gave a start at last: the bell was the\r\nvoice of the inn and the inn was the image of luncheon. They should be\r\nlate for it; they got up, and their quickened step on the return had\r\nsomething of the swing of confidence. When they reached the hotel the\r\n_table d\'h\xf4te_ had begun; this was clear from the threshold, clear\r\nfrom the absence in the hall and on the stairs of the "personnel,"\r\nas Mrs. Wix said--she had picked THAT up--all collected in the\r\ndining-room. They mounted to their apartments for a brush before the\r\nglass, and it was Maisie who, in passing and from a vain impulse,\r\nthrew open the white and gold door. She was thus first to utter the\r\nsound that brought Mrs. Wix almost on top of her, as by the other\r\naccident it would have brought her on top of Mrs. Wix. It had at any\r\nrate the effect of leaving them bunched together in a strained stare\r\nat their new situation. This situation had put on in a flash the\r\nbright form of Mrs. Beale: she stood there in her hat and her jacket,\r\namid bags and shawls, smiling and holding out her arms. If she had\r\njust arrived it was a different figure from either of the two that for\r\nTHEIR benefit, wan and tottering and none too soon to save life, the\r\nChannel had recently disgorged. She was as lovely as the day that had\r\nbrought her over, as fresh as the luck and the health that attended\r\nher: it came to Maisie on the spot that she was more beautiful than\r\nshe had ever been. All this was too quick to count, but there was\r\nstill time in it to give the child the sense of what had kindled the\r\nlight. That leaped out of the open arms, the open eyes, the open\r\nmouth; it leaped out with Mrs. Beale\'s loud cry at her: "I\'m free,\r\nI\'m free!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest wonder of all was the way Mrs. Beale addressed her\r\nannouncement, so far as could be judged, equally to Mrs. Wix, who, as\r\nif from sudden failure of strength, sank into a chair while Maisie\r\nsurrendered to the visitor\'s embrace. As soon as the child was liberated\r\nshe met with profundity Mrs. Wix\'s stupefaction and actually was able to\r\nsee that while in a manner sustaining the encounter her face yet seemed\r\nwith intensity to say: "Now, for God\'s sake, don\'t crow \'I told you\r\nso!\'" Maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition\r\nto crow; it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick\r\nsurvey of the objects surrounding Mrs. Beale as showed that among them\r\nwas no appurtenance of Sir Claude\'s. She knew his dressing-bag now--oh\r\nwith the fondest knowledge!--and there was an instant during which its\r\nnot being there was a stroke of the worst news. She was yet to learn\r\nwhat it could be to recognise in some lapse of a sequence the proof of\r\nan extinction, and therefore remained unaware that this momentary pang\r\nwas a foretaste of the experience of death. It of course yielded in\r\na flash to Mrs. Beale\'s brightness, it gasped itself away in her own\r\ninstant appeal. "You\'ve come alone?"\r\n\r\n"Without Sir Claude?" Strangely, Mrs. Beale looked even brighter. "Yes;\r\nin the eagerness to get at you. You abominable little villain!"--and her\r\nstepmother, laughing clear, administered to her cheek a pat that was\r\npartly a pinch. "What were you up to and what did you take me for? But\r\nI\'m glad to be abroad, and after all it\'s you who have shown me the way.\r\nI mightn\'t, without you, have been able to come--to come, that is, so\r\nsoon. Well, here I am at any rate and in a moment more I should have\r\nbegun to worry about you. This will do very well"--she was good-natured\r\nabout the place and even presently added that it was charming. Then with\r\na rosier glow she made again her great point: "I\'m free, I\'m free!"\r\nMaisie made on her side her own: she carried back her gaze to Mrs. Wix,\r\nwhom amazement continued to hold; she drew afresh her old friend\'s\r\nattention to the superior way she didn\'t take that up. What she did take\r\nup the next minute was the question of Sir Claude. "Where is he? Won\'t\r\nhe come?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale\'s consideration of this oscillated with a smile between the\r\ntwo expectancies with which she was flanked: it was conspicuous, it\r\nwas extraordinary, her unblinking acceptance of Mrs. Wix, a miracle of\r\nwhich Maisie had even now begun to read a reflexion in that lady\'s long\r\nvisage. "He\'ll come, but we must MAKE him!" she gaily brought forth.\r\n\r\n"Make him?" Maisie echoed.\r\n\r\n"We must give him time. We must play our cards."\r\n\r\n"But he promised us awfully," Maisie replied.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, he has promised ME awfully; I mean lots of things, and\r\nnot in every case kept his promise to the letter." Mrs. Beale\'s good\r\nhumour insisted on taking for granted Mrs. Wix\'s, to whom her attention\r\nhad suddenly grown prodigious. "I dare say he has done the same with\r\nyou, and not always come to time. But he makes it up in his own way--and\r\nit isn\'t as if we didn\'t know exactly what he is. There\'s one thing he\r\nis," she went on, "which makes everything else only a question, for us,\r\nof tact." They scarce had time to wonder what this was before, as they\r\nmight have said, it flew straight into their face. "He\'s as free as I\r\nam!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said Maisie; as if, however, independently weighing the\r\nvalue of that. She really weighed also the oddity of her stepmother\'s\r\ntreating it as news to HER, who had been the first person literally to\r\nwhom Sir Claude had mentioned it. For a few seconds, as if with the\r\nsound of it in her ears, she stood with him again, in memory and in the\r\ntwilight, in the hotel garden at Folkestone.\r\n\r\nAnything Mrs. Beale overlooked was, she indeed divined, but the effect\r\nof an exaltation of high spirits, a tendency to soar that showed even\r\nwhen she dropped--still quite impartially--almost to the confidential.\r\n"Well, then--we\'ve only to wait. He can\'t do without us long. I\'m sure,\r\nMrs. Wix, he can\'t do without YOU! He\'s devoted to you; he has told me\r\nso much about you. The extent I count on you, you know, count on you to\r\nhelp me--" was an extent that even all her radiance couldn\'t express.\r\nWhat it couldn\'t express quite as much as what it could made at any rate\r\nevery instant her presence and even her famous freedom loom larger; and\r\nit was this mighty mass that once more led her companions, bewildered\r\nand disjoined, to exchange with each other as through a thickening veil\r\nconfused and ineffectual signs. They clung together at least on the\r\ncommon ground of unpreparedness, and Maisie watched without relief the\r\nhavoc of wonder in Mrs. Wix. It had reduced her to perfect impotence,\r\nand, but that gloom was black upon her, she sat as if fascinated by Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s high style. It had plunged her into a long deep hush; for what\r\nhad happened was the thing she had least allowed for and before which\r\nthe particular rigour she had worked up could only grow limp and sick.\r\nSir Claude was to have reappeared with his accomplice or without\r\nher; never, never his accomplice without HIM. Mrs. Beale had gained\r\napparently by this time an advantage she could pursue: she looked at the\r\ndroll dumb figure with jesting reproach. "You really won\'t shake hands\r\nwith me? Never mind; you\'ll come round!" She put the matter to no test,\r\ngoing on immediately and, instead of offering her hand, raising it, with\r\na pretty gesture that her bent head met, to a long black pin that played\r\na part in her back hair. "Are hats worn at luncheon? If you\'re as hungry\r\nas I am we must go right down."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix stuck fast, but she met the question in a voice her pupil\r\nscarce recognised. "I wear mine."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, swallowing at one glance her brand-new bravery, which she\r\nappeared at once to refer to its origin and to follow in its flights,\r\naccepted this as conclusive. "Oh but I\'ve not such a beauty!" Then she\r\nturned rejoicingly to Maisie. "I\'ve got a beauty for YOU my dear."\r\n\r\n"A beauty?"\r\n\r\n"A love of a hat--in my luggage. I remembered THAT"--she nodded at the\r\nobject on her stepdaughter\'s head--"and I\'ve brought you one with a\r\npeacock\'s breast. It\'s the most gorgeous blue!"\r\n\r\nIt was too strange, this talking with her there already not about\r\nSir Claude but about peacocks--too strange for the child to have the\r\npresence of mind to thank her. But the felicity in which she had arrived\r\nwas so proof against everything that Maisie felt more and more the depth\r\nof the purpose that must underlie it. She had a vague sense of its being\r\nabysmal, the spirit with which Mrs. Beale carried off the awkwardness,\r\nin the white and gold salon, of such a want of breath and of welcome.\r\nMrs. Wix was more breathless than ever; the embarrassment of Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s isolation was as nothing to the embarrassment of her grace. The\r\nperception of this dilemma was the germ on the child\'s part of a new\r\nquestion altogether. What if WITH this indulgence--? But the idea lost\r\nitself in something too frightened for hope and too conjectured for\r\nfear; and while everything went by leaps and bounds one of the waiters\r\nstood at the door to remind them that the _table d\'h\xf4te_ was half over.\r\n\r\n"Had you come up to wash hands?" Mrs. Beale hereupon asked them. "Go and\r\ndo it quickly and I\'ll be with you: they\'ve put my boxes in that nice\r\nroom--it was Sir Claude\'s. Trust him," she laughed, "to have a nice\r\none!" The door of a neighbouring room stood open, and now from the\r\nthreshold, addressing herself again to Mrs. Wix, she launched a note\r\nthat gave the very key of what, as she would have said, she was up to.\r\n"Dear lady, please attend to my daughter."\r\n\r\nShe was up to a change of deportment so complete that it represented--oh\r\nfor offices still honourably subordinate if not too explicitly\r\nmenial--an absolute coercion, an interested clutch of the old woman\'s\r\nrespectability. There was response, to Maisie\'s view, I may say at once,\r\nin the jump of that respectability to its feet: it was itself capable of\r\none of the leaps, one of the bounds just mentioned, and it carried its\r\ncharge, with this momentum and while Mrs. Beale popped into Sir Claude\'s\r\nchamber, straight away to where, at the end of the passage, pupil and\r\ngoverness were quartered. The greatest stride of all, for that matter,\r\nwas that within a few seconds the pupil had, in another relation, been\r\nconverted into a daughter. Maisie\'s eyes were still following it when,\r\nafter the rush, with the door almost slammed and no thought of soap and\r\ntowels, the pair stood face to face. Mrs. Wix, in this position, was the\r\nfirst to gasp a sound. "Can it ever be that SHE has one?"\r\n\r\nMaisie felt still more bewildered. "One what?"\r\n\r\n"Why moral sense."\r\n\r\nThey spoke as if you might have two, but Mrs. Wix looked as if it were\r\nnot altogether a happy thought, and Maisie didn\'t see how even an\r\naffirmative from her own lips would clear up what had become most of a\r\nmystery. It was to this larger puzzle she sprang pretty straight. "IS\r\nshe my mother now?"\r\n\r\nIt was a point as to which an horrific glimpse of the responsibility of\r\nan opinion appeared to affect Mrs. Wix like a blow in the stomach. She\r\nhad evidently never thought of it; but she could think and rebound. "If\r\nshe is, he\'s equally your father."\r\n\r\nMaisie, however, thought further. "Then my father and my mother--!"\r\n\r\nBut she had already faltered and Mrs. Wix had already glared back:\r\n"Ought to live together? Don\'t begin it AGAIN!" She turned away with\r\na groan, to reach the washing-stand, and Maisie could by this time\r\nrecognise with a certain ease that that way verily madness did lie. Mrs.\r\nWix gave a great untidy splash, but the next instant had faced round.\r\n"She has taken a new line."\r\n\r\n"She was nice to you," Maisie concurred.\r\n\r\n"What SHE thinks so--\'go and dress the young lady!\' But it\'s something!"\r\nshe panted. Then she thought out the rest. "If he won\'t have her, why\r\nshe\'ll have YOU. She\'ll be the one."\r\n\r\n"The one to keep me abroad?"\r\n\r\n"The one to give you a home." Mrs. Wix saw further; she mastered all the\r\nportents. "Oh she\'s cruelly clever! It\'s not a moral sense." She reached\r\nher climax: "It\'s a game!"\r\n\r\n"A game?"\r\n\r\n"Not to lose him. She has sacrificed him--to her duty."\r\n\r\n"Then won\'t he come?" Maisie pleaded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix made no answer; her vision absorbed her. "He has fought. But\r\nshe has won."\r\n\r\n"Then won\'t he come?" the child repeated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix made it out. "Yes, hang him!" She had never been so profane.\r\n\r\nFor all Maisie minded! "Soon--to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Too soon--whenever. Indecently soon."\r\n\r\n"But then we SHALL be together!" the child went on. It made Mrs. Wix\r\nlook at her as if in exasperation; but nothing had time to come before\r\nshe precipitated: "Together with YOU!" The air of criticism continued,\r\nbut took voice only in her companion\'s bidding her wash herself and come\r\ndown. The silence of quick ablutions fell upon them, presently broken,\r\nhowever, by one of Maisie\'s sudden reversions. "Mercy, isn\'t she\r\nhandsome?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix had finished; she waited. "She\'ll attract attention." They\r\nwere rapid, and it would have been noticed that the shock the beauty\r\nhad given them acted, incongruously, as a positive spur to their\r\npreparations for rejoining her. She had none the less, when they\r\nreturned to the sitting-room, already descended; the open door of her\r\nroom showed it empty and the chambermaid explained. Here again they were\r\ndelayed by another sharp thought of Mrs. Wix\'s. "But what will she live\r\non meanwhile?"\r\n\r\nMaisie stopped short. "Till Sir Claude comes?"\r\n\r\nIt was nothing to the violence with which her friend had been arrested.\r\n"Who\'ll pay the bills?"\r\n\r\nMaisie thought. "Can\'t SHE?"\r\n\r\n"She? She hasn\'t a penny."\r\n\r\nThe child wondered. "But didn\'t papa--?"\r\n\r\n"Leave her a fortune?" Mrs. Wix would have appeared to speak of papa as\r\ndead had she not immediately added: "Why he lives on other women!"\r\n\r\nOh yes, Maisie remembered. "Then can\'t he send--" She faltered again;\r\neven to herself it sounded queer.\r\n\r\n"Some of their money to his wife?" Mrs. Wix pave a laugh still stranger\r\nthan the weird suggestion. "I dare say she\'d take it!"\r\n\r\nThey hurried on again; yet again, on the stairs, Maisie pulled up.\r\n"Well, if she had stopped in England--!" she threw out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix considered. "And he had come over instead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as we expected." Maisie launched her speculation. "What then would\r\nshe have lived on?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix hung fire but an instant. "On other men!" And she marched\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, at table between the pair, plainly attracted the attention\r\nMrs. Wix had foretold. No other lady present was nearly so handsome,\r\nnor did the beauty of any other accommodate itself with such art to the\r\nhomage it produced. She talked mainly to her other neighbour, and that\r\nleft Maisie leisure both to note the manner in which eyes were riveted\r\nand nudges interchanged, and to lose herself in the meanings that, dimly\r\nas yet and disconnectedly, but with a vividness that fed apprehension,\r\nshe could begin to read into her stepmother\'s independent move. Mrs. Wix\r\nhad helped her by talking of a game; it was a connexion in which the\r\nmove could put on a strategic air. Her notions of diplomacy were thin,\r\nbut it was a kind of cold diplomatic shoulder and an elbow of more than\r\nusual point that, temporarily at least, were presented to her by the\r\naverted inclination of Mrs. Beale\'s head. There was a phrase familiar to\r\nMaisie, so often was it used by this lady to express the idea of one\'s\r\ngetting what one wanted: one got it--Mrs. Beale always said SHE at all\r\nevents always got it or proposed to get it--by "making love." She was\r\nat present making love, singular as it appeared, to Mrs. Wix, and her\r\nyoung friend\'s mind had never moved in such freedom as on thus finding\r\nitself face to face with the question of what she wanted to get. This\r\nperiod of the _omelette aux rognons_ and the poulet saut\xe9, while her sole\r\nsurviving parent, her fourth, fairly chattered to her governess, left\r\nMaisie rather wondering if her governess would hold out. It was strange,\r\nbut she became on the spot quite as interested in Mrs. Wix\'s moral\r\nsense as Mrs. Wix could possibly be in hers: it had risen before her so\r\npressingly that this was something new for Mrs. Wix to resist. Resisting\r\nMrs. Beale herself promised at such a rate to become a very different\r\nbusiness from resisting Sir Claude\'s view of her. More might come of\r\nwhat had happened--whatever it was--than Maisie felt she could have\r\nexpected. She put it together with a suspicion that, had she ever in\r\nher life had a sovereign changed, would have resembled an impression,\r\nbaffled by the want of arithmetic, that her change was wrong: she groped\r\nabout in it that she was perhaps playing the passive part in a case of\r\nviolent substitution. A victim was what she should surely be if the\r\nissue between her step-parents had been settled by Mrs. Beale\'s saying:\r\n"Well, if she can live with but one of us alone, with which in the world\r\nshould it be but me?" That answer was far from what, for days, she had\r\nnursed herself in, and the desolation of it was deepened by the absence\r\nof anything from Sir Claude to show he had not had to take it as\r\ntriumphant. Had not Mrs. Beale, upstairs, as good as given out that\r\nshe had quitted him with the snap of a tension, left him, dropped him\r\nin London, after some struggle as a sequel to which her own advent\r\nrepresented that she had practically sacrificed him? Maisie assisted in\r\nfancy at the probable episode in the Regent\'s Park, finding elements\r\nalmost of terror in the suggestion that Sir Claude had not had fair\r\nplay. They drew something, as she sat there, even from the pride of an\r\nassociation with such beauty as Mrs. Beale\'s; and the child quite forgot\r\nthat, though the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale herself was a solution she had\r\nnot invented, she would probably have seen Sir Claude embark upon it\r\nwithout a direct remonstrance.\r\n\r\nWhat her stepmother had clearly now promised herself to wring from Mrs.\r\nWix was an assent to the great modification, the change, as smart as a\r\njuggler\'s trick, in the interest of which nothing so much mattered as\r\nthe new convenience of Mrs. Beale. Maisie could positively seize the\r\nmoral that her elbow seemed to point in ribs thinly defended--the moral\r\nof its not mattering a straw which of the step-parents was the guardian.\r\nThe essence of the question was that a girl wasn\'t a boy: if Maisie had\r\nbeen a mere rough trousered thing, destined at the best probably to grow\r\nup a scamp, Sir Claude would have been welcome. As the case stood he had\r\nsimply tumbled out of it, and Mrs. Wix would henceforth find herself in\r\nthe employ of the right person. These arguments had really fallen into\r\ntheir place, for our young friend, at the very touch of that tone in\r\nwhich she had heard her new title declared. She was still, as a result\r\nof so many parents, a daughter to somebody even after papa and mamma\r\nwere to all intents dead. If her father\'s wife and her mother\'s husband,\r\nby the operation of a natural or, for all she knew, a legal rule, were\r\nin the shoes of their defunct partners, then Mrs. Beale\'s partner was\r\nexactly as defunct as Sir Claude\'s and her shoes the very pair to which,\r\nin "Farange _v._ Farange and Others," the divorce court had given\r\npriority. The subject of that celebrated settlement saw the rest of\r\nher day really filled out with the pomp of all that Mrs. Beale assumed.\r\nThe assumption rounded itself there between this lady\'s entertainers,\r\nflourished in a way that left them, in their bottomless element, scarce\r\na free pair of eyes to exchange signals. It struck Maisie even a little\r\nthat there was a rope or two Mrs. Wix might have thrown out if she\r\nwould, a rocket or two she might have sent up. They had at any rate\r\nnever been so long together without communion or telegraphy, and their\r\ncompanion kept them apart by simply keeping them with her. From this\r\nsituation they saw the grandeur of their intenser relation to her pass\r\nand pass like an endless procession. It was a day of lively movement\r\nand of talk on Mrs. Beale\'s part so brilliant and overflowing as to\r\nrepresent music and banners. She took them out with her promptly to walk\r\nand to drive, and even--towards night--sketched a plan for carrying them\r\nto the Etablissement, where, for only a franc apiece, they should listen\r\nto a concert of celebrities. It reminded Maisie, the plan, of the\r\nside-shows at Earl\'s Court, and the franc sounded brighter than the\r\nshillings which had at that time failed; yet this too, like the other,\r\nwas a frustrated hope: the francs failed like the shillings and the\r\nside-shows had set an example to the concert. The Etablissement in short\r\nmelted away, and it was little wonder that a lady who from the moment of\r\nher arrival had been so gallantly in the breach should confess herself\r\nit last done up. Maisie could appreciate her fatigue; the day had not\r\npassed without such an observer\'s discovering that she was excited and\r\neven mentally comparing her state to that of the breakers after a gale.\r\nIt had blown hard in London, and she would take time to go down. It was\r\nof the condition known to the child by report as that of talking against\r\ntime that her emphasis, her spirit, her humour, which had never dropped,\r\nnow gave the impression.\r\n\r\nShe too was delighted with foreign manners; but her daughter\'s\r\nopportunities of explaining them to her were unexpectedly forestalled\r\nby her own tone of large acquaintance with them. One of the things that\r\nnipped in the bud all response to her volubility was Maisie\'s surprised\r\nretreat before the fact that Continental life was what she had been\r\nalmost brought up on. It was Mrs. Beale, disconcertingly, who began to\r\nexplain it to her friends; it was she who, wherever they turned, was the\r\ninterpreter, the historian and the guide. She was full of reference to\r\nher early travels--at the age of eighteen: she had at that period made,\r\nwith a distinguished Dutch family, a stay on the Lake of Geneva. Maisie\r\nhad in the old days been regaled with anecdotes of these adventures,\r\nbut they had with time become phantasmal, and the heroine\'s quite showy\r\nexemption from bewilderment at Boulogne, her acuteness on some of the\r\nvery subjects on which Maisie had been acute to Mrs. Wix, were a high\r\nnote of the majesty, of the variety of advantage, with which she had\r\nalighted. It was all a part of the wind in her sails and of the weight\r\nwith which her daughter was now to feel her hand. The effect of it on\r\nMaisie was to add already the burden of time to her separation from Sir\r\nClaude. This might, to her sense, have lasted for days; it was as if,\r\nwith their main agitation transferred thus to France and with neither\r\nmamma now nor Mrs. Beale nor Mrs. Wix nor herself at his side, he must\r\nbe fearfully alone in England. Hour after hour she felt as if she were\r\nwaiting; yet she couldn\'t have said exactly for what. There were moments\r\nwhen Mrs. Beale\'s flow of talk was a mere rattle to smother a knock.\r\nAt no part of the crisis had the rattle so public a purpose as when,\r\ninstead of letting Maisie go with Mrs. Wix to prepare for dinner, she\r\npushed her--with a push at last incontestably maternal--straight into\r\nthe room inherited from Sir Claude. She titivated her little charge with\r\nher own brisk hands; then she brought out: "I\'m going to divorce your\r\nfather."\r\n\r\nThis was so different from anything Maisie had expected that it took\r\nsome time to reach her mind. She was aware meanwhile that she probably\r\nlooked rather wan. "To marry Sir Claude?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale rewarded her with a kiss. "It\'s sweet to hear you put it so."\r\n\r\nThis was a tribute, but it left Maisie balancing for an objection. "How\r\nCAN you when he\'s married?"\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t--practically. He\'s free, you know."\r\n\r\n"Free to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Free, first, to divorce his own fiend."\r\n\r\nThe benefit that, these last days, she had felt she owed a certain\r\nperson left Maisie a moment so ill-prepared for recognising this lurid\r\nlabel that she hesitated long enough to risk: "Mamma?"\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t your mamma any longer," Mrs. Beale returned. "Sir Claude has\r\npaid her money to cease to be." Then as if remembering how little, to\r\nthe child, a pecuniary transaction must represent: "She lets him off\r\nsupporting her if he\'ll let her off supporting you."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale appeared, however, to have done injustice to her daughter\'s\r\nfinancial grasp. "And support me himself?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\n"Take the whole bother and burden of you and never let her hear of you\r\nagain. It\'s a regular signed contract."\r\n\r\n"Why that\'s lovely of her!" Maisie cried.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not so lovely, my dear, but that he\'ll get his divorce."\r\n\r\nMaisie was briefly silent; after which, "No--he won\'t get it," she said.\r\nThen she added still more boldly: "And you won\'t get yours."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, who was at the dressing-glass, turned round with amusement\r\nand surprise. "How do you know that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I know!" cried Maisie.\r\n\r\n"From Mrs. Wix?"\r\n\r\nMaisie debated, then after an instant took her cue from Mrs. Beale\'s\r\nabsence of anger, which struck her the more as she had felt how much of\r\nher courage she needed. "From Mrs. Wix," she admitted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, at the glass again, made play with a powder-puff. "My own\r\nsweet, she\'s mistaken!" was all she said.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain force in the very amenity of this, but our young\r\nlady reflected long enough to remember that it was not the answer Sir\r\nClaude himself had made. The recollection nevertheless failed to prevent\r\nher saying: "Do you mean then that he won\'t come till he has got it?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale gave a last touch; she was ready; she stood there in all her\r\nelegance. "I mean, my dear, that it\'s because he HASN\'T got it that I\r\nleft him."\r\n\r\nThis opened a view that stretched further than Maisie could reach. She\r\nturned away from it, but she spoke before they went out again. "Do you\r\nlike Mrs. Wix now?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my chick, I was just going to ask you if you think she has come at\r\nall to like poor bad me!"\r\n\r\nMaisie thought, at this hint; but unsuccessfully. "I haven\'t the least\r\nidea. But I\'ll find out."\r\n\r\n"Do!" said Mrs. Beale, rustling out with her in a scented air and as if\r\nit would be a very particular favour.\r\n\r\nThe child tried promptly at bed-time, relieved now of the fear that\r\ntheir visitor would wish to separate her for the night from her\r\nattendant. "Have you held out?" she began as soon as the two doors at\r\nthe end of the passage were again closed on them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked hard at the flame of the candle. "Held out--?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she has been making love to you. Has she won you over?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix transferred her intensity to her pupil\'s face. "Over to what?"\r\n\r\n"To HER keeping me instead."\r\n\r\n"Instead of Sir Claude?" Mrs. Wix was distinctly gaining time.\r\n\r\n"Yes; who else? since it\'s not instead of you."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix coloured at this lucidity. "Yes, that IS what she means."\r\n\r\n"Well, do you like it?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\nShe actually had to wait, for oh her friend was embarrassed! "My\r\nopposition to the connexion--theirs--would then naturally to some extent\r\nfall. She has treated me to-day as if I weren\'t after all quite such a\r\nworm; not that I don\'t know very well where she got the pattern of her\r\npoliteness. But of course," Mrs. Wix hastened to add, "I shouldn\'t like\r\nher as THE one nearly so well as him."\r\n\r\n"\'Nearly so well!\'" Maisie echoed. "I should hope indeed not." She spoke\r\nwith a firmness under which she was herself the first to quiver. "I\r\nthought you \'adored\' him."\r\n\r\n"I do," Mrs. Wix sturdily allowed.\r\n\r\n"Then have you suddenly begun to adore her too?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, instead of directly answering, only blinked in support of her\r\nsturdiness. "My dear, in what a tone you ask that! You\'re coming out."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I? YOU\'VE come out. Mrs. Beale has come out. We each have\r\nour turn!" And Maisie threw off the most extraordinary little laugh that\r\nhad ever passed her young lips.\r\n\r\nThere passed Mrs. Wix\'s indeed the next moment a sound that more than\r\nmatched it. "You\'re most remarkable!" she neighed.\r\n\r\nHer pupil, though wholly without aspirations to pertness, barely\r\nfaltered. "I think you\'ve done a great deal to make me so."\r\n\r\n"Very true, I have." She dropped to humility, as if she recalled her so\r\nrecent self-arraignment.\r\n\r\n"Would you accept her then? That\'s what I ask," said Maisie.\r\n\r\n"As a substitute?" Mrs. Wix turned it over; she met again the child\'s\r\neyes. "She has literally almost fawned upon me."\r\n\r\n"She hasn\'t fawned upon HIM. She hasn\'t even been kind to him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked as if she had now an advantage. "Then do you propose to\r\n\'kill\' her?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t answer my question," Maisie persisted. "I want to know if you\r\naccept her."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix continued to hedge. "I want to know if YOU do!"\r\n\r\nEverything in the child\'s person, at this, announced that it was easy to\r\nknow. "Not for a moment."\r\n\r\n"Not the two now?" Mrs. Wix had caught on; she flushed with it. "Only\r\nhim alone?"\r\n\r\n"Him alone or nobody."\r\n\r\n"Not even ME?" cried Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at her a moment, then began to undress. "Oh you\'re\r\nnobody!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nHer sleep was drawn out, she instantly recognised lateness in the way\r\nher eyes opened to Mrs. Wix, erect, completely dressed, more dressed\r\nthan ever, and gazing at her from the centre of the room. The next thing\r\nshe was sitting straight up, wide awake with the fear of the hours of\r\n"abroad" that she might have lost. Mrs. Wix looked as if the day had\r\nalready made itself felt, and the process of catching up with it began\r\nfor Maisie in hearing her distinctly say: "My poor dear, he has come!"\r\n\r\n"Sir Claude?" Maisie, clearing the little bed-rug with the width of her\r\nspring, felt the polished floor under her bare feet.\r\n\r\n"He crossed in the night; he got in early." Mrs. Wix\'s head jerked\r\nstiffly backward. "He\'s there."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve seen him?"\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s there--he\'s there," Mrs. Wix repeated. Her voice came out with\r\na queer extinction that was not a voluntary drop, and she trembled so\r\nthat it added to their common emotion. Visibly pale, they gazed at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it too BEAUTIFUL?" Maisie panted back at her; a challenge with an\r\nanswer to which, however, she was not ready at once. The term Maisie had\r\nused was a flash of diplomacy--to prevent at any rate Mrs. Wix\'s using\r\nanother. To that degree it was successful; there was only an appeal,\r\nstrange and mute, in the white old face, which produced the effect of\r\na want of decision greater than could by any stretch of optimism have\r\nbeen associated with her attitude toward what had happened. For Maisie\r\nherself indeed what had happened was oddly, as she could feel, less of a\r\nsimple rapture than any arrival or return of the same supreme friend had\r\never been before. What had become overnight, what had become while she\r\nslept, of the comfortable faculty of gladness? She tried to wake it up a\r\nlittle wider by talking, by rejoicing, by plunging into water and into\r\nclothes, and she made out that it was ten o\'clock, but also that Mrs.\r\nWix had not yet breakfasted. The day before, at nine, they had had\r\ntogether a _caf\xe9 complet_ in their sitting-room. Mrs. Wix on her side\r\nhad evidently also a refuge to seek. She sought it in checking the\r\nprecipitation of some of her pupil\'s present steps, in recalling to her\r\nwith an approach to sternness that of such preliminaries those embodied\r\nin a thorough use of soap should be the most thorough, and in throwing\r\neven a certain reprobation on the idea of hurrying into clothes for\r\nthe sake of a mere stepfather. She took her in hand with a silent\r\ninsistence; she reduced the process to sequences more definite than any\r\nit had known since the days of Moddle. Whatever it might be that had\r\nnow, with a difference, begun to belong to Sir Claude\'s presence was\r\nstill after all compatible, for our young lady, with the instinct of\r\ndressing to see him with almost untidy haste. Mrs. Wix meanwhile luckily\r\nwas not wholly directed to repression. "He\'s there--he\'s there!" she\r\nhad said over several times. It was her answer to every invitation\r\nto mention how long she had been up and her motive for respecting so\r\nrigidly the slumber of her companion. It formed for some minutes her\r\nonly account of the whereabouts of the others and her reason for not\r\nhaving yet seen them, as well as of the possibility of their presently\r\nbeing found in the salon.\r\n\r\n"He\'s there--he\'s there!" she declared once more as she made, on the\r\nchild, with an almost invidious tug, a strained undergarment "meet."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean he\'s in the salon?" Maisie asked again.\r\n\r\n"He\'s WITH her," Mrs. Wix desolately said. "He\'s with her," she\r\nreiterated.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean in her own room?" Maisie continued.\r\n\r\nShe waited an instant. "God knows!"\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered a little why, or how, God should know; this, however,\r\ndelayed but an instant her bringing out: "Well, won\'t she go back?"\r\n\r\n"Go back? Never!"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll stay all the same?"\r\n\r\n"All the more."\r\n\r\n"Then won\'t Sir Claude go?" Maisie asked.\r\n\r\n"Go back--if SHE doesn\'t?" Mrs. Wix appeared to give this question the\r\nbenefit of a minute\'s thought. "Why should he have come--only to go\r\nback?"\r\n\r\nMaisie produced an ingenious solution. "To MAKE her go. To take her."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix met it without a concession. "If he can make her go so easily,\r\nwhy should he have let her come?"\r\n\r\nMaisie considered. "Oh just to see ME. She has a right."\r\n\r\n"Yes--she has a right."\r\n\r\n"She\'s my mother!" Maisie tentatively tittered.\r\n\r\n"Yes--she\'s your mother."\r\n\r\n"Besides," Maisie went on, "he didn\'t let her come. He doesn\'t like her\r\ncoming, and if he doesn\'t like it--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix took her up. "He must lump it--that\'s what he must do! Your\r\nmother was right about him--I mean your real one. He has no strength.\r\nNo--none at all." She seemed more profoundly to muse. "He might have\r\nhad some even with HER--I mean with her ladyship. He\'s just a poor sunk\r\nslave," she asserted with sudden energy.\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered again. "A slave?"\r\n\r\n"To his passions."\r\n\r\nShe continued to wonder and even to be impressed; after which she went\r\non: "But how do you know he\'ll stay?"\r\n\r\n"Because he likes us!"--and Mrs. Wix, with her emphasis of the word,\r\nwhirled her charge round again to deal with posterior hooks. She had\r\npositively never shaken her so.\r\n\r\nIt was as if she quite shook something out of her. "But how will that\r\nhelp him if we--in spite of his liking!--don\'t stay?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean if we go off and leave him with her?--" Mrs. Wix put the\r\nquestion to the back of her pupil\'s head. "It WON\'T help him. It will be\r\nhis ruin. He\'ll have got nothing. He\'ll have lost everything. It will be\r\nhis utter destruction, for he\'s certain after a while to loathe her."\r\n\r\n"Then when he loathes her"--it was astonishing how she caught the\r\nidea--"he\'ll just come right after us!" Maisie announced.\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Never?"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll keep him. She\'ll hold him for ever."\r\n\r\nMaisie doubted. "When he \'loathes\' her?"\r\n\r\n"That won\'t matter. She won\'t loathe HIM. People don\'t!" Mrs. Wix\r\nbrought up.\r\n\r\n"Some do. Mamma does," Maisie contended.\r\n\r\n"Mamma does NOT!" It was startling--her friend contradicted her flat.\r\n"She loves him--she adores him. A woman knows." Mrs. Wix spoke not only\r\nas if Maisie were not a woman, but as if she would never be one. "_I_\r\nknow!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Then why on earth has she left him?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix hesitated. "He hates HER. Don\'t stoop so--lift up your hair.\r\nYou know how I\'m affected toward him," she added with dignity; "but\r\nyou must also know that I see clear."\r\n\r\nMaisie all this time was trying hard to do likewise. "Then if she has\r\nleft him for that why shouldn\'t Mrs. Beale leave him?"\r\n\r\n"Because she\'s not such a fool!"\r\n\r\n"Not such a fool as mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely--if you WILL have it. Does it look like her leaving him?"\r\nMrs. Wix enquired. She brooded again; then she went on with more\r\nintensity: "Do you want to know really and truly why? So that she may\r\nbe his wretchedness and his punishment."\r\n\r\n"His punishment?"--this was more than as yet Maisie could quite accept.\r\n"For what?"\r\n\r\n"For everything. That\'s what will happen: he\'ll be tied to her for ever.\r\nShe won\'t mind in the least his hating her, and she won\'t hate him back.\r\nShe\'ll only hate US."\r\n\r\n"Us?" the child faintly echoed.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll hate YOU."\r\n\r\n"Me? Why, I brought them together!" Maisie resentfully cried.\r\n\r\n"You brought them together." There was a completeness in Mrs. Wix\'s\r\nassent. "Yes; it was a pretty job. Sit down." She began to brush her\r\npupil\'s hair and, as she took up the mass of it with some force of\r\nhand, went on with a sharp recall: "Your mother adored him at first--it\r\nmight have lasted. But he began too soon with Mrs. Beale. As you say,"\r\nshe pursued with a brisk application of the brush, "you brought them\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"I brought them together"--Maisie was ready to reaffirm it. She felt\r\nnone the less for a moment at the bottom of a hole; then she seemed to\r\nsee a way out. "But I didn\'t bring mamma together--" She just faltered.\r\n\r\n"With all those gentlemen?"--Mrs. Wix pulled her up. "No; it isn\'t quite\r\nso bad as that."\r\n\r\n"I only said to the Captain"--Maisie had the quick memory of it--"that\r\nI hoped he at least (he was awfully nice!) would love her and keep her."\r\n\r\n"And even that wasn\'t much harm," threw in Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t much good," Maisie was obliged to recognise. "She can\'t bear\r\nhim--not even a mite. She told me at Folkestone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix suppressed a gasp; then after a bridling instant during\r\nwhich she might have appeared to deflect with difficulty from her odd\r\nconsideration of Ida\'s wrongs: "He was a nice sort of person for her to\r\ntalk to you about!"\r\n\r\n"Oh I LIKE him!" Maisie promptly rejoined; and at this, with an\r\ninarticulate sound and an inconsequence still more marked, her companion\r\nbent over and dealt her on the cheek a rapid peck which had the apparent\r\nintention of a kiss.\r\n\r\n"Well, if her ladyship doesn\'t agree with you, what does it only prove?"\r\nMrs. Wix demanded in conclusion. "It proves that she\'s fond of Sir\r\nClaude!"\r\n\r\nMaisie, in the light of some of the evidence, reflected on that till her\r\nhair was finished, but when she at last started up she gave a sign of no\r\nvery close embrace of it. She grasped at this moment Mrs. Wix\'s arm. "He\r\nmust have got his divorce!"\r\n\r\n"Since day before yesterday? Don\'t talk trash."\r\n\r\nThis was spoken with an impatience which left the child nothing to\r\nreply; whereupon she sought her defence in a completely different\r\nrelation to the fact. "Well, I knew he would come!"\r\n\r\n"So did I; but not in twenty-four hours. I gave him a few days!" Mrs.\r\nWix wailed.\r\n\r\nMaisie, whom she had now released, looked at her with interest. "How\r\nmany did SHE give him?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix faced her a moment; then as if with a bewildered sniff: "You\r\nhad better ask her!" But she had no sooner uttered the words than she\r\ncaught herself up. "Lord o\' mercy, how we talk!"\r\n\r\nMaisie felt that however they talked she must see him, but she said\r\nnothing more for a time, a time during which she conscientiously\r\nfinished dressing and Mrs. Wix also kept silence. It was as if they each\r\nhad almost too much to think of, and even as if the child had the sense\r\nthat her friend was watching her and seeing if she herself were watched.\r\nAt last Mrs. Wix turned to the window and stood--sightlessly, as Maisie\r\ncould guess--looking away. Then our young lady, before the glass, gave\r\nthe supreme shake. "Well, I\'m ready. And now to SEE him!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix turned round, but as if without having heard her. "It\'s\r\ntremendously grave." There were slow still tears behind the\r\nstraighteners.\r\n\r\n"It is--it is." Maisie spoke as if she were now dressed quite up to the\r\noccasion; as if indeed with the last touch she had put on the\r\njudgement-cap. "I must see him immediately."\r\n\r\n"How can you see him if he doesn\'t send for you?"\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t I go and find him?"\r\n\r\n"Because you don\'t know where he is."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I just look in the salon?" That still seemed simple to Maisie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix, however, instantly cut it off. "I wouldn\'t have you look in\r\nthe salon for all the world!" Then she explained a little: "The salon\r\nisn\'t ours now."\r\n\r\n"Ours?"\r\n\r\n"Yours and mine. It\'s theirs."\r\n\r\n"Theirs?" Maisie, with her stare, continued to echo. "You mean they want\r\nto keep us out?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix faltered; she sank into a chair and, as Maisie had often enough\r\nseen her do before, covered her face with her hands. "They ought to, at\r\nleast. The situation\'s too monstrous!"\r\n\r\nMaisie stood there a moment--she looked about the room. "I\'ll go to\r\nhim--I\'ll find him."\r\n\r\n"_I_ won\'t! I won\'t go NEAR them!" cried Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll see him alone." The child spied what she had been looking\r\nfor--she possessed herself of her hat. "Perhaps I\'ll take him out!" And\r\nwith decision she quitted the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the salon it was empty, but at the sound of the opened\r\ndoor some one stirred on the balcony, and Sir Claude, stepping straight\r\nin, stood before her. He was in light fresh clothes and wore a straw hat\r\nwith a bright ribbon; these things, besides striking her in themselves\r\nas the very promise of the grandest of grand tours, gave him a certain\r\nradiance and, as it were, a tropical ease; but such an effect only\r\nmarked rather more his having stopped short and, for a longer minute\r\nthan had ever at such a juncture elapsed, not opened his arms to her.\r\nHis pause made her pause and enabled her to reflect that he must have\r\nbeen up some time, for there were no traces of breakfast; and that\r\nthough it was so late he had rather markedly not caused her to be called\r\nto him. Had Mrs. Wix been right about their forfeiture of the salon? Was\r\nit all his now, all his and Mrs. Beale\'s? Such an idea, at the rate her\r\nsmall thoughts throbbed, could only remind her of the way in which what\r\nhad been hers hitherto was what was exactly most Mrs. Beale\'s and his.\r\nIt was strange to be standing there and greeting him across a gulf,\r\nfor he had by this time spoken, smiled and said: "My dear child, my\r\ndear child!" but without coming any nearer. In a flash she saw he was\r\ndifferent--more so than he knew or designed. The next minute indeed it\r\nwas as if he caught an impression from her face: this made him hold out\r\nhis hand. Then they met, he kissed her, he laughed, she thought he even\r\nblushed: something of his affection rang out as usual. "Here I am, you\r\nsee, again--as I promised you."\r\n\r\nIt was not as he had promised them--he had not promised them Mrs. Beale;\r\nbut Maisie said nothing about that. What she said was simply: "I knew\r\nyou had come. Mrs. Wix told me."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. And where is she?"\r\n\r\n"In her room. She got me up--she dressed me."\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked at her up and down; a sweetness of mockery that she\r\nparticularly loved came out in his face whenever he did that, and it\r\nwas not wanting now. He raised his eyebrows and his arms to play at\r\nadmiration; he was evidently after all disposed to be gay. "Got you\r\nup?--I should think so! She has dressed you most beautifully. Isn\'t she\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\nMaisie wondered if she had better tell. "She said not."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t she want to see a poor devil?"\r\n\r\nShe looked about under the vibration of the way he described himself,\r\nand her eyes rested on the door of the room he had previously occupied.\r\n"Is Mrs. Beale in there?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked blankly at the same object. "I haven\'t the least\r\nidea!"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t seen her?"\r\n\r\n"Not the tip of her nose."\r\n\r\nMaisie thought: there settled on her, in the light of his beautiful\r\nsmiling eyes, the faintest purest coldest conviction that he wasn\'t\r\ntelling the truth. "She hasn\'t welcomed you?"\r\n\r\n"Not by a single sign."\r\n\r\n"Then where is she?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude laughed; he seemed both amused and surprised at the point\r\nshe made of it. "I give it up!"\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t she know you\'ve come?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. "Perhaps she doesn\'t care!"\r\n\r\nMaisie, with an inspiration, pounced on his arm. "Has she GONE?"\r\n\r\nHe met her eyes and then she could see that his own were really much\r\ngraver than his manner. "Gone?" She had flown to the door, but before\r\nshe could raise her hand to knock he was beside her and had caught it.\r\n"Let her be. I don\'t care about her. I want to see YOU."\r\n\r\n"Then she HASN\'T gone?"\r\n\r\nMaisie fell back with him. He still looked as if it were a joke, but the\r\nmore she saw of him the more she could make out that he was troubled.\r\n"It wouldn\'t be like her!"\r\n\r\nShe stood wondering at him. "Did you want her to come?"\r\n\r\n"How can you suppose--?" He put it to her candidly. "We had an immense\r\nrow over it."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean you\'ve quarrelled?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude was at a loss. "What has she told you?"\r\n\r\n"That I\'m hers as much as yours. That she represents papa."\r\n\r\nHis gaze struck away through the open window and up to the sky; she\r\ncould hear him rattle in his trousers-pockets his money or his keys.\r\n"Yes--that\'s what she keeps saying." It gave him for a moment an air\r\nthat was almost helpless.\r\n\r\n"You say you don\'t care about her," Maisie went on. "DO you mean you\'ve\r\nquarrelled?"\r\n\r\n"We do nothing in life but quarrel."\r\n\r\nHe rose before her, as he said this, so soft and fair, so rich, in spite\r\nof what might worry him, in restored familiarities, that it gave a\r\nbright blur to the meaning--to what would otherwise perhaps have been\r\nthe palpable promise--of the words.\r\n\r\n"Oh YOUR quarrels!" she exclaimed with discouragement.\r\n\r\n"I assure you hers are quite fearful!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t speak of hers. I speak of yours."\r\n\r\n"Ah don\'t do it till I\'ve had my coffee! You\'re growing up clever," he\r\nadded. Then he said: "I suppose you\'ve breakfasted?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--I\'ve had nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing in your room?"--he was all compunction. "My dear old\r\nman!--we\'ll breakfast then together." He had one of his happy thoughts.\r\n"I say--we\'ll go out."\r\n\r\n"That was just what I hoped. I\'ve brought my hat."\r\n\r\n"You ARE clever! We\'ll go to a caf\xe9." Maisie was already at the door; he\r\nglanced round the room. "A moment--my stick." But there appeared to be\r\nno stick. "No matter; I left it--oh!" He remembered with an odd drop and\r\ncame out.\r\n\r\n"You left it in London?" she asked as they went downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Yes--in London: fancy!"\r\n\r\n"You were in such a hurry to come," Maisie explained.\r\n\r\nHe had his arm round her. "That must have been the reason."\r\n\r\nHalfway down he stopped short again, slapping his leg. "And poor Mrs.\r\nWix?"\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s face just showed a shadow. "Do you want her to come?"\r\n\r\n"Dear no--I want to see you alone."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way I want to see YOU!" she replied. "Like before."\r\n\r\n"Like before!" he gaily echoed. "But I mean has she had her coffee?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll send it up to her. Madame!" He had already, at the foot of\r\nthe stair, called out to the stout _patronne_, a lady who turned to\r\nhim from the bustling, breezy hall a countenance covered with fresh\r\nmatutinal powder and a bosom as capacious as the velvet shelf of a\r\nchimneypiece, over which her round white face, framed in its golden\r\nfrizzle, might have figured as a showy clock. He ordered, with\r\nparticular recommendations, Mrs. Wix\'s repast, and it was a charm to\r\nhear his easy brilliant French: even his companion\'s ignorance could\r\nmeasure the perfection of it. The _patronne_, rubbing her hands and\r\nbreaking in with high swift notes as into a florid duet, went with him\r\nto the street, and while they talked a moment longer Maisie remembered\r\nwhat Mrs. Wix had said about every one\'s liking him. It came out enough\r\nthrough the morning powder, it came out enough in the heaving bosom, how\r\nthe landlady liked him. He had evidently ordered something lovely for\r\nMrs. Wix. _"Et bien soign\xe9, n\'est-ce-pas?"_\r\n\r\n_"Soyez tranquille"_--the patronne beamed upon him. _"Et pour Madame?"_\r\n\r\n_"Madame?"_ he echoed--it just pulled him up a little.\r\n\r\n_"Rien encore?"_\r\n\r\n"_Rien encore._ Come, Maisie." She hurried along with him, but on the way\r\nto the caf\xe9 he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter they were seated there it was different: the place was not below\r\nthe hotel, but further along the quay; with wide, clear windows and a\r\nfloor sprinkled with bran in a manner that gave it for Maisie something\r\nof the added charm of a circus. They had pretty much to themselves the\r\npainted spaces and the red plush benches; these were shared by a few\r\nscattered gentlemen who picked teeth, with facial contortions, behind\r\nlittle bare tables, and by an old personage in particular, a very old\r\npersonage with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, whose manner of soaking\r\nbuttered rolls in coffee and then disposing of them in the little that\r\nwas left of the interval between his nose and chin might at a less\r\nanxious hour have cast upon Maisie an almost envious spell. They too\r\nhad their _caf\xe9 au lait_ and their buttered rolls, determined by Sir\r\nClaude\'s asking her if she could with that light aid wait till the hour\r\nof d\xe9jeuner. His allusion to this meal gave her, in the shaded sprinkled\r\ncoolness, the scene, as she vaguely felt, of a sort of ordered mirrored\r\nlicence, the haunt of those--the irregular, like herself--who went to\r\nbed or who rose too late, something to think over while she watched\r\nthe white-aproned waiter perform as nimbly with plates and saucers as\r\na certain conjurer her friend had in London taken her to a music-hall\r\nto see. Sir Claude had presently begun to talk again, to tell her how\r\nLondon had looked and how long he had felt himself, on either side, to\r\nhave been absent; all about Susan Ash too and the amusement as well as\r\nthe difficulty he had had with her; then all about his return journey\r\nand the Channel in the night and the crowd of people coming over and\r\nthe way there were always too many one knew. He spoke of other matters\r\nbeside, especially of what she must tell him of the occupations, while\r\nhe was away, of Mrs. Wix and her pupil. Hadn\'t they had the good time he\r\nhad promised?--had he exaggerated a bit the arrangements made for their\r\npleasure? Maisie had something--not all there was--to say of his success\r\nand of their gratitude: she had a complication of thought that grew\r\nevery minute, grew with the consciousness that she had never seen him in\r\nthis particular state in which he had been given back.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix had once said--it was once or fifty times; once was enough for\r\nMaisie, but more was not too much--that he was wonderfully various.\r\nWell, he was certainly so, to the child\'s mind, on the present occasion:\r\nhe was much more various than he was anything else. Besides, the fact\r\nthat they were together in a shop, at a nice little intimate table as\r\nthey had so often been in London, only made greater the difference of\r\nwhat they were together about. This difference was in his face, in his\r\nvoice, in every look he gave her and every movement he made. They were\r\nnot the looks and the movements he really wanted to show, and she could\r\nfeel as well that they were not those she herself wanted. She had\r\nseen him nervous, she had seen every one she had come in contact with\r\nnervous, but she had never seen him so nervous as this. Little by little\r\nit gave her a settled terror, a terror that partook of the coldness she\r\nhad felt just before, at the hotel, to find herself, on his answer about\r\nMrs. Beale, disbelieve him. She seemed to see at present, to touch\r\nacross the table, as if by laying her hand on it, what he had meant when\r\nhe confessed on those several occasions to fear. Why was such a man so\r\noften afraid? It must have begun to come to her now that there was one\r\nthing just such a man above all could be afraid of. He could be afraid\r\nof himself. His fear at all events was there; his fear was sweet to her,\r\nbeautiful and tender to her, was having coffee and buttered rolls and\r\ntalk and laughter that were no talk and laughter at all with her; his\r\nfear was in his jesting postponing perverting voice; it was just in\r\nthis make-believe way he had brought her out to imitate the old London\r\nplaytimes, to imitate indeed a relation that had wholly changed, a\r\nrelation that she had with her very eyes seen in the act of change when,\r\nthe day before in the salon, Mrs. Beale rose suddenly before her. She\r\nrose before her, for that matter, now, and even while their refreshment\r\ndelayed Maisie arrived at the straight question for which, on their\r\nentrance, his first word had given opportunity. "Are we going to have\r\nd\xe9jeuner with Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\nHis reply was anything but straight. "You and I?"\r\n\r\nMaisie sat back in her chair. "Mrs. Wix and me."\r\n\r\nSir Claude also shifted. "That\'s an enquiry, my dear child, that Mrs.\r\nBeale herself must answer." Yes, he had shifted; but abruptly, after a\r\nmoment during which something seemed to hang there between them and, as\r\nit heavily swayed, just fan them with the air of its motion, she felt\r\nthat the whole thing was upon them. "Do you mind," he broke out, "my\r\nasking you what Mrs. Wix has said to you?"\r\n\r\n"Said to me?"\r\n\r\n"This day or two--while I was away."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean about you and Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude, resting on his elbows, fixed his eyes a moment on the white\r\nmarble beneath them. "No; I think we had a good deal of that--didn\'t\r\nwe?--before I left you. It seems to me we had it pretty well all out. I\r\nmean about yourself, about your--don\'t you know?--associating with us,\r\nas I might say, and staying on with us. While you were alone with our\r\nfriend what did she say?"\r\n\r\nMaisie felt the weight of the question; it kept her silent for a space\r\nduring which she looked at Sir Claude, whose eyes remained bent.\r\n"Nothing," she returned at last.\r\n\r\nHe showed incredulity. "Nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," Maisie repeated; on which an interruption descended in the\r\nform of a tray bearing the preparations for their breakfast. These\r\npreparations were as amusing as everything else; the waiter poured their\r\ncoffee from a vessel like a watering-pot and then made it froth with the\r\ncurved stream of hot milk that dropped from the height of his raised\r\narm; but the two looked across at each other through the whole play of\r\nFrench pleasantness with a gravity that had now ceased to dissemble.\r\nSir Claude sent the waiter off again for something and then took up her\r\nanswer. "Hasn\'t she tried to affect you?"\r\n\r\nFace to face with him thus it seemed to Maisie that she had tried so\r\nlittle as to be scarce worth mentioning; again therefore an instant she\r\nshut herself up. Presently she found her middle course. "Mrs. Beale\r\nlikes her now; and there\'s one thing I\'ve found out--a great thing.\r\nMrs. Wix enjoys her being so kind. She was tremendously kind all day\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"I see. And what did she do?" Sir Claude asked.\r\n\r\nMaisie was now busy with her breakfast, and her companion attacked his\r\nown; so that it was all, in form at least, even more than their old\r\nsociability. "Everything she could think of. She was as nice to her as\r\nyou are," the child said. "She talked to her all day."\r\n\r\n"And what did she say to her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh I don\'t know." Maisie was a little bewildered with his pressing her\r\nso for knowledge; it didn\'t fit into the degree of intimacy with Mrs.\r\nBeale that Mrs. Wix had so denounced and that, according to that lady,\r\nhad now brought him back in bondage. Wasn\'t he more aware than his\r\nstepdaughter of what would be done by the person to whom he was bound?\r\nIn a moment, however, she added: "She made love to her."\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked at her harder, and it was clearly something in her\r\ntone that made him quickly say: "You don\'t mind my asking you, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; only I should think you\'d know better than I."\r\n\r\n"What Mrs. Beale did yesterday?"\r\n\r\nShe thought he coloured a trifle; but almost simultaneously with that\r\nimpression she found herself answering: "Yes--if you have seen her."\r\n\r\nHe broke into the loudest of laughs. "Why, my dear boy, I told you just\r\nnow I\'ve absolutely not. I say, don\'t you believe me?"\r\n\r\nThere was something she was already so afraid of that it covered up\r\nother fears. "Didn\'t you come back to see her?" she enquired in a\r\nmoment. "Didn\'t you come back because you always want to so much?"\r\n\r\nHe received her enquiry as he had received her doubt--with an\r\nextraordinary absence of resentment. "I can imagine of course why you\r\nthink that. But it doesn\'t explain my doing what I have. It was, as I\r\nsaid to you just now at the inn, really and truly you I wanted to see."\r\n\r\nShe felt an instant as she used to feel when, in the back garden at her\r\nmother\'s, she took from him the highest push of a swing--high, high,\r\nhigh--that he had had put there for her pleasure and that had finally\r\nbroken down under the weight and the extravagant patronage of the cook.\r\n"Well, that\'s beautiful. But to see me, you mean, and go away again?"\r\n\r\n"My going away again is just the point. I can\'t tell yet--it all\r\ndepends."\r\n\r\n"On Mrs. Beale?" Maisie asked. "SHE won\'t go away." He finished emptying\r\nhis coffee-cup and then, when he had put it down, leaned back in his\r\nchair, where she could see that he smiled on her. This only added to her\r\nidea that he was in trouble, that he was turning somehow in his pain and\r\ntrying different things. He continued to smile and she went on: "Don\'t\r\nyou know that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I may as well confess to you that as much as that I do know. SHE\r\nwon\'t go away. She\'ll stay."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll stay. She\'ll stay," Maisie repeated.\r\n\r\n"Just so. Won\'t you have some more coffee?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please."\r\n\r\n"And another buttered roll?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please."\r\n\r\nHe signed to the hovering waiter, who arrived with the shining spout of\r\nplenty in either hand and with the friendliest interest in mademoiselle.\r\n_"Les tartines sont l\xe0."_ Their cups were replenished and, while he\r\nwatched almost musingly the bubbles in the fragrant mixture, "Just\r\nso--just so," Sir Claude said again and again. "It\'s awfully awkward!"\r\nhe exclaimed when the waiter had gone.\r\n\r\n"That she won\'t go?"\r\n\r\n"Well--everything! Well, well, well!" But he pulled himself together;\r\nhe began again to eat. "I came back to ask you something. That\'s what\r\nI came back for."\r\n\r\n"I know what you want to ask me," Maisie said.\r\n\r\n"Are you very sure?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m ALMOST very."\r\n\r\n"Well then risk it. You mustn\'t make ME risk everything."\r\n\r\nShe was struck with the force of this. "You want to know if I should be\r\nhappy with THEM."\r\n\r\n"With those two ladies only? No, no, old man: _vous n\'y \xeates pas_. So\r\nnow--there!" Sir Claude laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well then what is it?"\r\n\r\nThe next minute, instead of telling her what it was, he laid his hand\r\nacross the table on her own and held her as if under the prompting of a\r\nthought. "Mrs. Wix would stay with HER?"\r\n\r\n"Without you? Oh yes--now."\r\n\r\n"On account, as you just intimated, of Mrs. Beale\'s changed manner?"\r\n\r\nMaisie, with her sense of responsibility, weighed both Mrs. Beale\'s\r\nchanged manner and Mrs. Wix\'s human weakness. "I think she talked her\r\nround."\r\n\r\nSir Claude thought a moment. "Ah poor dear!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--Mrs. Wix."\r\n\r\n"She likes being talked round--treated like any one else. Oh she likes\r\ngreat politeness," Maisie expatiated. "It affects her very much."\r\n\r\nSir Claude, to her surprise, demurred a little to this. "Very much--up\r\nto a certain point."\r\n\r\n"Oh up to any point!" Maisie returned with emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Well, haven\'t I been polite to her?"\r\n\r\n"Lovely--and she perfectly worships you."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear child, why can\'t she let me alone?"--this time Sir\r\nClaude unmistakeably blushed. Before Maisie, however, could answer his\r\nquestion, which would indeed have taken her long, he went on in another\r\ntone: "Mrs. Beale thinks she has probably quite broken her down. But she\r\nhasn\'t."\r\n\r\nThough he spoke as if he were sure, Maisie was strong in the impression\r\nshe had just uttered and that she now again produced. "She has talked\r\nher round."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes; round to herself, but not round to me."\r\n\r\nOh she couldn\'t bear to hear him say that! "To you? Don\'t you really\r\nbelieve how she loves you?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude examined his belief. "Of course I know she\'s wonderful."\r\n\r\n"She\'s just every bit as fond of you as _I_ am," said Maisie. "She told\r\nme so yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Ah then," he promptly exclaimed, "she HAS tried to affect you! I don\'t\r\nlove HER, don\'t you see? I do her perfect justice," he pursued, "but I\r\nmean I don\'t love her as I do you, and I\'m sure you wouldn\'t seriously\r\nexpect it. She\'s not my daughter--come, old chap! She\'s not even my\r\nmother, though I dare say it would have been better for me if she had\r\nbeen. I\'ll do for her what I\'d do for my mother, but I won\'t do more."\r\nHis real excitement broke out in a need to explain and justify himself,\r\nthough he kept trying to correct and conceal it with laughs and\r\nmouthfuls and other vain familiarities. Suddenly he broke off, wiping\r\nhis moustache with sharp pulls and coming back to Mrs. Beale. "Did she\r\ntry to talk YOU over?"\r\n\r\n"No--to me she said very little. Very little indeed," Maisie continued.\r\n\r\nSir Claude seemed struck with this. "She was only sweet to Mrs. Wix?"\r\n\r\n"As sweet as sugar!" cried Maisie.\r\n\r\nHe looked amused at her comparison, but he didn\'t contest it; he uttered\r\non the contrary, in an assenting way, a little inarticulate sound. "I\r\nknow what she CAN be. But much good may it have done her! Mrs. Wix won\'t\r\nCOME \'round.\' That\'s what makes it so fearfully awkward."\r\n\r\nMaisie knew it was fearfully awkward; she had known this now, she felt,\r\nfor some time, and there was something else it more pressingly concerned\r\nher to learn. "What is it you meant you came over to ask me?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Sir Claude, "I was just going to say. Let me tell you it\r\nwill surprise you." She had finished breakfast now and she sat back in\r\nher chair again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things\r\nbefore him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she\r\nwas convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash,\r\nas with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew\r\ntogether her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He\r\nlooked hard at her again; then he made his effort. "Should you see your\r\nway to let her go?"\r\n\r\nShe was bewildered. "To let who--?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Wix simply. I put it at the worst. Should you see your way to\r\nsacrifice her? Of course I know what I\'m asking."\r\n\r\nMaisie\'s eyes opened wide again; this was so different from what she had\r\nexpected. "And stay with you alone?"\r\n\r\nHe gave another push to his coffee-cup. "With me and Mrs. Beale. Of\r\ncourse it would be rather rum; but everything in our whole story is\r\nrather rum, you know. What\'s more unusual than for any one to be given\r\nup, like you, by her parents?"\r\n\r\n"Oh nothing is more unusual than THAT!" Maisie concurred, relieved at\r\nthe contact of a proposition as to which concurrence could have\r\nlucidity.\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be quite unconventional," Sir Claude went on--"I\r\nmean the little household we three should make together; but things have\r\ngot beyond that, don\'t you see? They got beyond that long ago. We shall\r\nstay abroad at any rate--it\'s ever so much easier and it\'s our affair\r\nand nobody else\'s: it\'s no one\'s business but ours on all the blessed\r\nearth. I don\'t say that for Mrs. Wix, poor dear--I do her absolute\r\njustice. I respect her; I see what she means; she has done me a lot of\r\ngood. But there are the facts. There they are, simply. And here am I,\r\nand here are you. And she won\'t come round. She\'s right from her point\r\nof view. I\'m talking to you in the most extraordinary way--I\'m always\r\ntalking to you in the most extraordinary way, ain\'t I? One would think\r\nyou were about sixty and that I--I don\'t know what any one would think\r\n_I_ am. Unless a beastly cad!" he suggested. "I\'ve been awfully worried,\r\nand this\'s what it has come to. You\'ve done us the most tremendous good,\r\nand you\'ll do it still and always, don\'t you see? We can\'t let you\r\ngo--you\'re everything. There are the facts as I say. She IS your mother\r\nnow, Mrs. Beale, by what has happened, and I, in the same way, I\'m your\r\nfather. No one can contradict that, and we can\'t get out of it. My idea\r\nwould be a nice little place--somewhere in the South--where she and you\r\nwould be together and as good as any one else. And I should be as good\r\ntoo, don\'t you see? for I shouldn\'t live with you, but I should be close\r\nto you--just round the corner, and it would be just the same. My idea\r\nwould be that it should all be perfectly open and frank. _Honi soit qui\r\nmal y pense_, don\'t you know? You\'re the best thing--you and what we can\r\ndo for you--that either of us has ever known," he came back to that.\r\n"When I say to her \'Give her up, come,\' she lets me have it bang in the\r\nface: \'Give her up yourself!\' It\'s the same old vicious circle--and when\r\nI say vicious I don\'t mean a pun, a what-d\'-ye-call-\'em. Mrs. Wix is the\r\nobstacle; I mean, you know, if she has affected you. She has affected\r\nME, and yet here I am. I never was in such a tight place: please believe\r\nit\'s only that that makes me put it to you as I do. My dear child, isn\'t\r\nthat--to put it so--just the way out of it? That came to me yesterday,\r\nin London, after Mrs. Beale had gone: I had the most infernal atrocious\r\nday. \'Go straight over and put it to her: let her choose, freely, her\r\nown self.\' So I do, old girl--I put it to you. CAN you choose freely?"\r\n\r\nThis long address, slowly and brokenly uttered, with fidgets and\r\nfalterings, with lapses and recoveries, with a mottled face and\r\nembarrassed but supplicating eyes, reached the child from a quarter\r\nso close that after the shock of the first sharpness she could see\r\nintensely its direction and follow it from point to point; all the more\r\nthat it came back to the point at which it had started. There was a word\r\nthat had hummed all through it. "Do you call it a \'sacrifice\'?"\r\n\r\n"Of Mrs. Wix? I\'ll call it whatever YOU call it. I won\'t funk it--I\r\nhaven\'t, have I? I\'ll face it in all its baseness. Does it strike you it\r\nIS base for me to get you well away from her, to smuggle you off here\r\ninto a corner and bribe you with sophistries and buttered rolls to\r\nbetray her?"\r\n\r\n"To betray her?"\r\n\r\n"Well--to part with her."\r\n\r\nMaisie let the question wait; the concrete image it presented was the\r\nmost vivid side of it. "If I part with her where will she go?"\r\n\r\n"Back to London."\r\n\r\n"But I mean what will she do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh as for that I won\'t pretend I know. I don\'t. We all have our\r\ndifficulties."\r\n\r\nThat, to Maisie, was at this moment more striking than it had ever been.\r\n"Then who\'ll teach me?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude laughed out. "What Mrs. Wix teaches?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled dimly; she saw what he meant. "It isn\'t so very very much."\r\n\r\n"It\'s so very very little," he returned, "that that\'s a thing we\'ve\r\npositively to consider. We probably shouldn\'t give you another\r\ngoverness. To begin with we shouldn\'t be able to get one--not of the\r\nonly kind that would do. It wouldn\'t do--the kind that WOULD do," he\r\nqueerly enough explained. "I mean they wouldn\'t stay--heigh-ho! We\'d\r\ndo you ourselves. Particularly me. You see I CAN now; I haven\'t got to\r\nmind--what I used to. I won\'t fight shy as I did--she can show out WITH\r\nme. Our relation, all round, is more regular."\r\n\r\nIt seemed wonderfully regular, the way he put it; yet none the less,\r\nwhile she looked at it as judiciously as she could, the picture it made\r\npersisted somehow in being a combination quite distinct--an old woman\r\nand a little girl seated in deep silence on a battered old bench by the\r\nrampart of the _haute ville_. It was just at that hour yesterday; they\r\nwere hand in hand; they had melted together. "I don\'t think you yet\r\nunderstand how she clings to you," Maisie said at last.\r\n\r\n"I do--I do. But for all that--" And he gave, turning in his conscious\r\nexposure, an oppressed impatient sigh; the sigh, even his companion\r\ncould recognise, of the man naturally accustomed to that argument, the\r\nman who wanted thoroughly to be reasonable, but who, if really he had to\r\nmind so many things, would be always impossibly hampered. What it came\r\nto indeed was that he understood quite perfectly. If Mrs. Wix clung it\r\nwas all the more reason for shaking Mrs. Wix off.\r\n\r\nThis vision of what she had brought him to occupied our young lady\r\nwhile, to ask what he owed, he called the waiter and put down a gold\r\npiece that the man carried off for change. Sir Claude looked after him,\r\nthen went on: "How could a woman have less to reproach a fellow with? I\r\nmean as regards herself."\r\n\r\nMaisie entertained the question. "Yes. How COULD she have less? So why\r\nare you so sure she\'ll go?"\r\n\r\n"Surely you heard why--you heard her come out three nights ago? How can\r\nshe do anything but go--after what she then said? I\'ve done what she\r\nwarned me of--she was absolutely right. So here we are. Her liking Mrs.\r\nBeale, as you call it now, is a motive sufficient, with other things,\r\nto make her, for your sake, stay on without me; it\'s not a motive\r\nsufficient to make her, even for yours, stay on WITH me--swallow, don\'t\r\nyou see? what she can\'t swallow. And when you say she\'s as fond of me as\r\nyou are I think I can, if that\'s the case, challenge you a little on it.\r\nWould YOU, only with those two, stay on without me?"\r\n\r\nThe waiter came back with the change, and that gave her, under this\r\nappeal, a moment\'s respite. But when he had retreated again with the\r\n"tip" gathered in with graceful thanks on a subtle hint from Sir\r\nClaude\'s forefinger, the latter, while pocketing the money, followed\r\nthe appeal up. "Would you let her make you live with Mrs. Beale?"\r\n\r\n"Without you? Never," Maisie then answered. "Never," she said again.\r\n\r\nIt made him quite triumph, and she was indeed herself shaken by the mere\r\nsound of it. "So you see you\'re not, like her," he exclaimed, "so ready\r\nto give me away!" Then he came back to his original question. "CAN you\r\nchoose? I mean can you settle it by a word yourself? Will you stay on\r\nwith us without her?" Now in truth she felt the coldness of her terror,\r\nand it seemed to her that suddenly she knew, as she knew it about Sir\r\nClaude, what she was afraid of. She was afraid of herself. She looked at\r\nhim in such a way that it brought, she could see, wonder into his face,\r\na wonder held in check, however, by his frank pretension to play fair\r\nwith her, not to use advantages, not to hurry nor hustle her--only to\r\nput her chance clearly and kindly before her. "May I think?" she finally\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly. But how long?"\r\n\r\n"Oh only a little while," she said meekly.\r\n\r\nHe had for a moment the air of wishing to look at it as if it were the\r\nmost cheerful prospect in the world. "But what shall we do while you\'re\r\nthinking?" He spoke as if thought were compatible with almost any\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing Maisie wished to do, and after an instant she\r\nexpressed it. "Have we got to go back to the hotel?"\r\n\r\n"Do you want to?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not the least necessity for it." He bent his eyes on his watch;\r\nhis face was now very grave. "We can do anything else in the world." He\r\nlooked at her again almost as if he were on the point of saying that\r\nthey might for instance start off for Paris. But even while she wondered\r\nif that were not coming he had a sudden drop. "We can take a walk."\r\n\r\nShe was all ready, but he sat there as if he had still something more to\r\nsay. This too, however, didn\'t come; so she herself spoke. "I think I\r\nshould like to see Mrs. Wix first."\r\n\r\n"Before you decide? All right--all right." He had put on his hat, but\r\nhe had still to light a cigarette. He smoked a minute, with his head\r\nthrown back, looking at the ceiling; then he said: "There\'s one thing\r\nto remember--I\'ve a right to impress it on you: we stand absolutely in\r\nthe place of your parents. It\'s their defection, their extraordinary\r\nbaseness, that has made our responsibility. Never was a young person\r\nmore directly committed and confided." He appeared to say this over, at\r\nthe ceiling, through his smoke, a little for his own illumination. It\r\ncarried him after a pause somewhat further. "Though I admit it was to\r\neach of us separately."\r\n\r\nHe gave her so at that moment and in that attitude the sense of wanting,\r\nas it were, to be on her side--on the side of what would be in every way\r\nmost right and wise and charming for her--that she felt a sudden desire\r\nto prove herself not less delicate and magnanimous, not less solicitous\r\nfor his own interests. What were these but that of the "regularity"\r\nhe had just before spoken of? "It WAS to each of you separately," she\r\naccordingly with much earnestness remarked. "But don\'t you remember? I\r\nbrought you together."\r\n\r\nHe jumped up with a delighted laugh. "Remember? Rather! You brought us\r\ntogether, you brought us together. Come!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nShe remained out with him for a time of which she could take no measure\r\nsave that it was too short for what she wished to make of it--an\r\ninterval, a barrier indefinite, insurmountable. They walked about, they\r\ndawdled, they looked in shop-windows; they did all the old things\r\nexactly as if to try to get back all the old safety, to get something\r\nout of them that they had always got before. This had come before,\r\nwhatever it was, without their trying, and nothing came now but the\r\nintenser consciousness of their quest and their subterfuge. The\r\nstrangest thing of all was what had really happened to the old safety.\r\nWhat had really happened was that Sir Claude was "free" and that Mrs.\r\nBeale was "free," and yet that the new medium was somehow still more\r\noppressive than the old. She could feel that Sir Claude concurred with\r\nher in the sense that the oppression would be worst at the inn, where,\r\ntill something should be settled, they would feel the want of\r\nsomething--of what could they call it but a footing? The question of the\r\nsettlement loomed larger to her now: it depended, she had learned, so\r\ncompletely on herself. Her choice, as her friend had called it, was\r\nthere before her like an impossible sum on a slate, a sum that in spite\r\nof her plea for consideration she simply got off from doing while she\r\nwalked about with him. She must see Mrs. Wix before she could do her\r\nsum; therefore the longer before she saw her the more distant would be\r\nthe ordeal. She met at present no demand whatever of her obligation; she\r\nsimply plunged, to avoid it, deeper into the company of Sir Claude. She\r\nsaw nothing that she had seen hitherto--no touch in the foreign picture\r\nthat had at first been always before her. The only touch was that of Sir\r\nClaude\'s hand, and to feel her own in it was her mute resistance to\r\ntime. She went about as sightlessly as if he had been leading her\r\nblindfold. If they were afraid of themselves it was themselves they\r\nwould find at the inn. She was certain now that what awaited them there\r\nwould be to lunch with Mrs. Beale. All her instinct was to avoid that,\r\nto draw out their walk, to find pretexts, to take him down upon the\r\nbeach, to take him to the end of the pier. He said no other word to her\r\nabout what they had talked of at breakfast, and she had a dim vision of\r\nhow his way of not letting her see him definitely wait for anything from\r\nher would make any one who should know of it, would make Mrs. Wix for\r\ninstance, think him more than ever a gentleman. It was true that once or\r\ntwice, on the jetty, on the sands, he looked at her for a minute with\r\neyes that seemed to propose to her to come straight off with him to\r\nParis. That, however, was not to give her a nudge about her\r\nresponsibility. He evidently wanted to procrastinate quite as much as\r\nshe did; he was not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the others.\r\nMaisie herself at this moment could be secretly merciless to Mrs. Wix--\r\nto the extent at any rate of not caring if her continued disappearance\r\ndid make that lady begin to worry about what had become of her, even\r\nbegin to wonder perhaps if the truants hadn\'t found their remedy. Her\r\nwant of mercy to Mrs. Beale indeed was at least as great; for Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s worry and wonder would be as much greater as the object at which\r\nthey were directed. When at last Sir Claude, at the far end of the\r\n_plage_, which they had already, in the many-coloured crowd, once\r\ntraversed, suddenly, with a look at his watch, remarked that it was\r\ntime, not to get back to the _table d\'h\xf4te_, but to get over to the\r\nstation and meet the Paris papers--when he did this she found herself\r\nthinking quite with intensity what Mrs. Beale and Mrs. Wix WOULD say. On\r\nthe way over to the station she had even a mental picture of the\r\nstepfather and the pupil established in a little place in the South\r\nwhile the governess and the stepmother, in a little place in the North,\r\nremained linked by a community of blankness and by the endless series of\r\nremarks it would give birth to. The Paris papers had come in and her\r\ncompanion, with a strange extravagance, purchased no fewer than eleven:\r\nit took up time while they hovered at the bookstall on the restless\r\nplatform, where the little volumes in a row were all yellow and pink and\r\none of her favourite old women in one of her favourite old caps\r\nabsolutely wheedled him into the purchase of three. They had thus so\r\nmuch to carry home that it would have seemed simpler, with such a\r\nprovision for a nice straight journey through France, just to "nip," as\r\nshe phrased it to herself, into the coup\xe9 of the train that, a little\r\nfurther along, stood waiting to start. She asked Sir Claude where it was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n"To Paris. Fancy!"\r\n\r\nShe could fancy well enough. They stood there and smiled, he with all\r\nthe newspapers under his arm and she with the three books, one yellow\r\nand two pink. He had told her the pink were for herself and the yellow\r\none for Mrs. Beale, implying in an interesting way that these were the\r\nnatural divisions in France of literature for the young and for the old.\r\nShe knew how prepared they looked to pass into the train, and she\r\npresently brought out to her companion: "I wish we could go. Won\'t you\r\ntake me?"\r\n\r\nHe continued to smile. "Would you really come?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, oh yes. Try."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to take our tickets?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, take them."\r\n\r\n"Without any luggage?"\r\n\r\nShe showed their two armfuls, smiling at him as he smiled at her, but so\r\nconscious of being more frightened than she had ever been in her life\r\nthat she seemed to see her whiteness as in a glass. Then she knew that\r\nwhat she saw was Sir Claude\'s whiteness: he was as frightened as\r\nherself. "Haven\'t we got plenty of luggage?" she asked. "Take the\r\ntickets--haven\'t you time? When does the train go?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude turned to a porter. "When does the train go?"\r\n\r\nThe man looked up at the station-clock. "In two minutes. _Monsieur est\r\nplac\xe9?_"\r\n\r\n_"Pas encore."_\r\n\r\n_"Et vos billets?--vous n\'avez que le temps."_ Then after a look at\r\nMaisie, _"Monsieur veut-il que je les prenne?"_ the man said.\r\n\r\nSir Claude turned back to her. _"Veux-tu lieu qu\'il en prenne?"_\r\n\r\nIt was the most extraordinary thing in the world: in the intensity of\r\nher excitement she not only by illumination understood all their French,\r\nbut fell into it with an active perfection. She addressed herself\r\nstraight to the porter. _"Prenny, prenny. Oh prenny!"_\r\n\r\n_"Ah si mademoiselle le veut--!"_ He waited there for the money.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Claude only stared--stared at her with his white face. "You HAVE\r\nchosen then? You\'ll let her go?"\r\n\r\nMaisie carried her eyes wistfully to the train, where, amid cries of\r\n_"En voiture, en voiture!"_ heads were at windows and doors banging\r\nloud. The porter was pressing. _"Ah vous n\'avez plus le temps!"_\r\n\r\n"It\'s going--it\'s going!" cried Maisie.\r\n\r\nThey watched it move, they watched it start; then the man went his way\r\nwith a shrug. "It\'s gone!" Sir Claude said.\r\n\r\nMaisie crept some distance up the platform; she stood there with her\r\nback to her companion, following it with her eyes, keeping down tears,\r\nnursing her pink and yellow books. She had had a real fright but had\r\nfallen back to earth. The odd thing was that in her fall her fear too\r\nhad been dashed down and broken. It was gone. She looked round at last,\r\nfrom where she had paused, at Sir Claude\'s, and then saw that his\r\nwasn\'t. It sat there with him on the bench to which, against the wall of\r\nthe station, he had retreated, and where, leaning back and, as she\r\nthought, rather queer, he still waited. She came down to him and he\r\ncontinued to offer his ineffectual intention of pleasantry. "Yes, I\'ve\r\nchosen," she said to him. "I\'ll let her go if you--if you--"\r\n\r\nShe faltered; he quickly took her up. "If I, if I--"\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll give up Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he exclaimed; on which she saw how much, how hopelessly he was\r\nafraid. She had supposed at the caf\xe9 that it was of his rebellion, of\r\nhis gathering motive; but how could that be when his temptations--that\r\ntemptation for example of the train they had just lost--were after all\r\nso slight? Mrs. Wix was right. He was afraid of his weakness--of his\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t have told you afterwards how they got back to the inn: she\r\ncould only have told you that even from this point they had not gone\r\nstraight, but once more had wandered and loitered and, in the course of\r\nit, had found themselves on the edge of the quay where--still apparently\r\nwith half an hour to spare--the boat prepared for Folkestone was drawn\r\nup. Here they hovered as they had done at the station; here they\r\nexchanged silences again, but only exchanged silences. There were\r\npunctual people on the deck, choosing places, taking the best; some of\r\nthem already contented, all established and shawled, facing to England\r\nand attended by the steward, who, confined on such a day to the lighter\r\noffices, tucked up the ladies\' feet or opened bottles with a pop. They\r\nlooked down at these things without a word; they even picked out a good\r\nplace for two that was left in the lee of a lifeboat; and if they\r\nlingered rather stupidly, neither deciding to go aboard nor deciding to\r\ncome away, it was Sir Claude quite as much as she who wouldn\'t move. It\r\nwas Sir Claude who cultivated the supreme stillness by which she knew\r\nbest what he meant. He simply meant that he knew all she herself meant.\r\nBut there was no pretence of pleasantry now: their faces were grave and\r\ntired. When at last they lounged off it was as if his fear, his fear of\r\nhis weakness, leaned upon her heavily as they followed the harbour. In\r\nthe hall of the hotel as they passed in she saw a battered old box that\r\nshe recognised, an ancient receptacle with dangling labels that she knew\r\nand a big painted W, lately done over and intensely personal, that\r\nseemed to stare at her with a recognition and even with some suspicion\r\nof its own. Sir Claude caught it too, and there was agitation for both\r\nof them in the sight of this object on the move. Was Mrs. Wix going and\r\nwas the responsibility of giving her up lifted, at a touch, from her\r\npupil? Her pupil and her pupil\'s companion, transfixed a moment, held,\r\nin the presence of the omen, communication more intense than in the\r\npresence either of the Paris train or of the Channel steamer; then, and\r\nstill without a word, they went straight upstairs. There, however, on\r\nthe landing, out of sight of the people below, they collapsed so that\r\nthey had to sink down together for support: they simply seated\r\nthemselves on the uppermost step while Sir Claude grasped the hand of\r\nhis stepdaughter with a pressure that at another moment would probably\r\nhave made her squeal. Their books and papers were all scattered. "She\r\nthinks you\'ve given her up!"\r\n\r\n"Then I must see her--I must see her," Maisie said.\r\n\r\n"To bid her good-bye?"\r\n\r\n"I must see her--I must see her," the child only repeated.\r\n\r\nThey sat a minute longer, Sir Claude, with his tight grip of her hand\r\nand looking away from her, looking straight down the staircase to where,\r\nround the turn, electric bells rattled and the pleasant sea-draught\r\nblew. At last, loosening his grasp, he slowly got up while she did the\r\nsame. They went together along the lobby, but before they reached the\r\nsalon he stopped again. "If I give up Mrs. Beale--?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go straight out with you again and not come back till she has\r\ngone."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to wonder. "Till Mrs. Beale--?" He had made it sound like a\r\nbad joke.\r\n\r\n"I mean till Mrs. Wix leaves--in that boat."\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked almost foolish. "Is she going in that boat?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. I won\'t even bid her good-bye," Maisie continued. "I\'ll\r\nstay out till the boat has gone. I\'ll go up to the old rampart."\r\n\r\n"The old rampart?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll sit on that old bench where you see the gold Virgin."\r\n\r\n"The gold Virgin?" he vaguely echoed. But it brought his eyes back to\r\nher as if after an instant he could see the place and the thing she\r\nnamed--could see her sitting there alone. "While I break with Mrs.\r\nBeale?"\r\n\r\n"While you break with Mrs. Beale."\r\n\r\nHe gave a long deep smothered sigh. "I must see her first."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t do as I do? Go out and wait?"\r\n\r\n"Wait?"--once more he appeared at a loss.\r\n\r\n"Till they both have gone," Maisie said.\r\n\r\n"Giving US up?"\r\n\r\n"Giving US up."\r\n\r\nOh with what a face for an instant he wondered if that could be! But his\r\nwonder the next moment only made him go to the door and, with his hand\r\non the knob, stand as if listening for voices. Maisie listened, but she\r\nheard none. All she heard presently was Sir Claude\'s saying with\r\nspeculation quite choked off, but so as not to be heard in the salon:\r\n"Mrs. Beale will never go." On this he pushed open the door and she went\r\nin with him. The salon was empty, but as an effect of their entrance the\r\nlady he had just mentioned appeared at the door of the bedroom. "Is she\r\ngoing?" he then demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale came forward, closing her door behind her. "I\'ve had the most\r\nextraordinary scene with her. She told me yesterday she\'d stay."\r\n\r\n"And my arrival has altered it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh we took that into account!" Mrs. Beale was flushed, which was never\r\nquite becoming to her, and her face visibly testified to the encounter\r\nto which she alluded. Evidently, however, she had not been worsted, and\r\nshe held up her head and smiled and rubbed her hands as if in sudden\r\nemulation of the _patronne_. "She promised she\'d stay even if you should\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Then why has she changed?"\r\n\r\n"Because she\'s a hound. The reason she herself gives is that you\'ve been\r\nout too long."\r\n\r\nSir Claude stared. "What has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been out an age," Mrs. Beale continued; "I myself couldn\'t\r\nimagine what had become of you. The whole morning," she exclaimed, "and\r\nluncheon long since over!"\r\n\r\nSir Claude appeared indifferent to that. "Did Mrs. Wix go down with\r\nyou?" he only asked.\r\n\r\n"Not she; she never budged!"--and Mrs. Beale\'s flush, to Maisie\'s\r\nvision, deepened. "She moped there--she didn\'t so much as come out to\r\nme; and when I sent to invite her she simply declined to appear. She\r\nsaid she wanted nothing, and I went down alone. But when I came up,\r\nfortunately a little primed"--and Mrs. Beale smiled a fine smile of\r\nbattle--"she WAS in the field!"\r\n\r\n"And you had a big row?"\r\n\r\n"We had a big row"--she assented with a frankness as large. "And while\r\nyou left me to that sort of thing I should like to know where you were!"\r\nShe paused for a reply, but Sir Claude merely looked at Maisie; a\r\nmovement that promptly quickened her challenge. "Where the mischief have\r\nyou been?"\r\n\r\n"You seem to take it as hard as Mrs. Wix," Sir Claude returned.\r\n\r\n"I take it as I choose to take it, and you don\'t answer my question."\r\n\r\nHe looked again at Maisie--as if for an aid to this effort; whereupon\r\nshe smiled at her stepmother and offered: "We\'ve been everywhere."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, however, made her no response, thereby adding to a surprise\r\nof which our young lady had already felt the light brush. She had\r\nreceived neither a greeting nor a glance, but perhaps this was not more\r\nremarkable than the omission, in respect to Sir Claude, parted with in\r\nLondon two days before, of any sign of a sense of their reunion. Most\r\nremarkable of all was Mrs. Beale\'s announcement of the pledge given by\r\nMrs. Wix and not hitherto revealed to her pupil. Instead of heeding this\r\nwitness she went on with acerbity: "It might surely have occurred to you\r\nthat something would come up."\r\n\r\nSir Claude looked at his watch. "I had no idea it was so late, nor that\r\nwe had been out so long. We weren\'t hungry. It passed like a flash. What\r\nHAS come up?"\r\n\r\n"Oh that she\'s disgusted," said Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"With whom then?"\r\n\r\n"With Maisie." Even now she never looked at the child, who stood there\r\nequally associated and disconnected. "For having no moral sense."\r\n\r\n"How SHOULD she have?" Sir Claude tried again to shine a little at the\r\ncompanion of his walk. "How at any rate is it proved by her going out\r\nwith me?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask ME; ask that woman. She drivels when she doesn\'t rage," Mrs.\r\nBeale declared.\r\n\r\n"And she leaves the child?"\r\n\r\n"She leaves the child," said Mrs. Beale with great emphasis and looking\r\nmore than ever over Maisie\'s head.\r\n\r\nIn this position suddenly a change came into her face, caused, as the\r\nothers could the next thing see, by the reappearance of Mrs. Wix in the\r\ndoorway which, on coming in at Sir Claude\'s heels, Maisie had left\r\ngaping. "I DON\'T leave the child--I don\'t, I don\'t!" she thundered from\r\nthe threshold, advancing upon the opposed three but addressing herself\r\ndirectly to Maisie. She was girded--positively harnessed--for departure,\r\narrayed as she had been arrayed on her advent and armed with a small fat\r\nrusty reticule which, almost in the manner of a battle-axe, she\r\nbrandished in support of her words. She had clearly come straight from\r\nher room, where Maisie in an instant guessed she had directed the\r\nremoval of her minor effects. "I don\'t leave you till I\'ve given you\r\nanother chance. Will you come WITH me?"\r\n\r\nMaisie turned to Sir Claude, who struck her as having been removed to a\r\ndistance of about a mile. To Mrs. Beale she turned no more than Mrs.\r\nBeale had turned: she felt as if already their difference had been\r\ndisclosed. What had come out about that in the scene between the two\r\nwomen? Enough came out now, at all events, as she put it practically to\r\nher stepfather. "Will YOU come? Won\'t you?" she enquired as if she had\r\nnot already seen that she should have to give him up. It was the last\r\nflare of her dream. By this time she was afraid of nothing.\r\n\r\n"I should think you\'d be too proud to ask!" Mrs. Wix interposed. Mrs.\r\nWix was herself conspicuously too proud.\r\n\r\nBut at the child\'s words Mrs. Beale had fairly bounded. "Come away from\r\nME, Maisie?" It was a wail of dismay and reproach, in which her\r\nstepdaughter was astonished to read that she had had no hostile\r\nconsciousness and that if she had been so actively grand it was not from\r\nsuspicion, but from strange entanglements of modesty.\r\n\r\nSir Claude presented to Mrs. Beale an expression positively sick. "Don\'t\r\nput it to her THAT way!" There had indeed been something in Mrs. Beale\'s\r\ntone, and for a moment our young lady was reminded of the old days in\r\nwhich so many of her friends had been "compromised."\r\n\r\nThis friend blushed; she was before Mrs. Wix, and though she bridled she\r\ntook the hint. "No--it isn\'t the way." Then she showed she knew the way.\r\n"Don\'t be a still bigger fool, dear, but go straight to your room and\r\nwait there till I can come to you."\r\n\r\nMaisie made no motion to obey, but Mrs. Wix raised a hand that\r\nforestalled every evasion. "Don\'t move till you\'ve heard me. I\'M going,\r\nbut I must first understand. Have you lost it again?"\r\n\r\nMaisie surveyed--for the idea of a describable loss--the immensity of\r\nspace. Then she replied lamely enough: "I feel as if I had lost\r\neverything."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix looked dark. "Do you mean to say you HAVE lost what we found\r\ntogether with so much difficulty two days ago?" As her pupil failed of\r\nresponse she continued: "Do you mean to say you\'ve already forgotten\r\nwhat we found together?"\r\n\r\nMaisie dimly remembered. "My moral sense?"\r\n\r\n"Your moral sense. HAVEN\'T I, after all, brought it out?" She spoke as\r\nshe had never spoken even in the schoolroom and with the book in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt brought back to the child\'s recollection how she sometimes couldn\'t\r\nrepeat on Friday the sentence that had been glib on Wednesday, and she\r\ndealt all feebly and ruefully with the present tough passage. Sir Claude\r\nand Mrs. Beale stood there like visitors at an "exam." She had indeed an\r\ninstant a whiff of the faint flower that Mrs. Wix pretended to have\r\nplucked and now with such a peremptory hand thrust at her nose. Then it\r\nleft her, and, as if she were sinking with a slip from a foothold, her\r\narms made a short jerk. What this jerk represented was the spasm within\r\nher of something still deeper than a moral sense. She looked at her\r\nexaminer; she looked at the visitors; she felt the rising of the tears\r\nshe had kept down at the station. They had nothing--no, distinctly\r\nnothing--to do with her moral sense. The only thing was the old flat\r\nshameful schoolroom plea. "I don\'t know--I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve lost it." Mrs. Wix seemed to close the book as she fixed\r\nthe straighteners on Sir Claude. "You\'ve nipped it in the bud. You\'ve\r\nkilled it when it had begun to live."\r\n\r\nShe was a newer Mrs. Wix than ever, a Mrs. Wix high and great; but Sir\r\nClaude was not after all to be treated as a little boy with a missed\r\nlesson. "I\'ve not killed anything," he said; "on the contrary I think\r\nI\'ve produced life. I don\'t know what to call it--I haven\'t even known\r\nhow decently to deal with it, to approach it; but, whatever it is, it\'s\r\nthe most beautiful thing I\'ve ever met--it\'s exquisite, it\'s sacred." He\r\nhad his hands in his pockets and, though a trace of the sickness he had\r\njust shown perhaps lingered there, his face bent itself with\r\nextraordinary gentleness on both the friends he was about to lose. "Do\r\nyou know what I came back for?" he asked of the elder.\r\n\r\n"I think I do!" cried Mrs. Wix, surprisingly un-mollified and with the\r\nheat of her late engagement with Mrs. Beale still on her brow. That\r\nlady, as if a little besprinkled by such turns of the tide, uttered a\r\nloud inarticulate protest and, averting herself, stood a moment at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"I came back with a proposal," said Sir Claude.\r\n\r\n"To me?" Mrs. Wix asked.\r\n\r\n"To Maisie. That she should give you up."\r\n\r\n"And does she?"\r\n\r\nSir Claude wavered. "Tell her!" he then exclaimed to the child, also\r\nturning away as if to give her the chance. But Mrs. Wix and her pupil\r\nstood confronted in silence, Maisie whiter than ever--more awkward,\r\nmore rigid and yet more dumb. They looked at each other hard, and as\r\nnothing came from them Sir Claude faced about again. "You won\'t tell\r\nher?--you can\'t?" Still she said nothing; whereupon, addressing Mrs.\r\nWix, he broke into a kind of ecstasy. "She refused--she refused!"\r\n\r\nMaisie, at this, found her voice. "I didn\'t refuse. I didn\'t," she\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nIt brought Mrs. Beale straight back to her. "You accepted, angel--you\r\naccepted!" She threw herself upon the child and, before Maisie could\r\nresist, had sunk with her upon the sofa, possessed of her, encircling\r\nher. "You\'ve given her up already, you\'ve given her up for ever, and\r\nyou\'re ours and ours only now, and the sooner she\'s off the better!"\r\n\r\nMaisie had shut her eyes, but at a word of Sir Claude\'s they opened.\r\n"Let her go!" he said to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"Never, never, never!" cried Mrs. Beale. Maisie felt herself more\r\ncompressed.\r\n\r\n"Let her go!" Sir Claude more intensely repeated. He was looking at Mrs.\r\nBeale and there was something in his voice. Maisie knew from a loosening\r\nof arms that she had become conscious of what it was; she slowly rose\r\nfrom the sofa, and the child stood there again dropped and divided.\r\n"You\'re free--you\'re free," Sir Claude went on; at which Maisie\'s back\r\nbecame aware of a push that vented resentment and that placed her again\r\nin the centre of the room, the cynosure of every eye and not knowing\r\nwhich way to turn.\r\n\r\nShe turned with an effort to Mrs. Wix. "I didn\'t refuse to give you up.\r\nI said I would if HE\'D give up--"\r\n\r\n"Give up Mrs. Beale?" burst from Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\n"Give up Mrs. Beale. What do you call that but exquisite?" Sir Claude\r\ndemanded of all of them, the lady mentioned included; speaking with a\r\nrelish as intense now as if some lovely work of art or of nature had\r\nsuddenly been set down among them. He was rapidly recovering himself on\r\nthis basis of fine appreciation. "She made her condition--with such a\r\nsense of what it should be! She made the only right one."\r\n\r\n"The only right one?"--Mrs. Beale returned to the charge. She had taken\r\na moment before a snub from him, but she was not to be snubbed on this.\r\n"How can you talk such rubbish and how can you back her up in such\r\nimpertinence? What in the world have you done to her to make her think\r\nof such stuff?" She stood there in righteous wrath; she flashed her eyes\r\nround the circle. Maisie took them full in her own, knowing that here at\r\nlast was the moment she had had most to reckon with. But as regards her\r\nstepdaughter Mrs. Beale subdued herself to a question deeply mild. "HAVE\r\nyou made, my own love, any such condition as that?"\r\n\r\nSomehow, now that it was there, the great moment was not so bad. What\r\nhelped the child was that she knew what she wanted. All her learning and\r\nlearning had made her at last learn that; so that if she waited an\r\ninstant to reply it was only from the desire to be nice. Bewilderment\r\nhad simply gone or at any rate was going fast. Finally she answered.\r\n"Will you give HIM up? Will you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah leave her alone--leave her, leave her!" Sir Claude in sudden\r\nsupplication murmured to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix at the same instant found another apostrophe. "Isn\'t it enough\r\nfor you, madam, to have brought her to discussing your relations?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale left Sir Claude unheeded, but Mrs. Wix could make her flame.\r\n"My relations? What do you know, you hideous creature, about my\r\nrelations, and what business on earth have you to speak of them? Leave\r\nthe room this instant, you horrible old woman!"\r\n\r\n"I think you had better go--you must really catch your boat," Sir Claude\r\nsaid distressfully to Mrs. Wix. He was out of it now, or wanted to be;\r\nhe knew the worst and had accepted it: what now concerned him was to\r\nprevent, to dissipate vulgarities. "Won\'t you go--won\'t you just get off\r\nquickly?"\r\n\r\n"With the child as quickly as you like. Not without her." Mrs. Wix was\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\n"Then why did you lie to me, you fiend?" Mrs. Beale almost yelled. "Why\r\ndid you tell me an hour ago that you had given her up?"\r\n\r\n"Because I despaired of her--because I thought she had left me." Mrs.\r\nWix turned to Maisie. "You were WITH them--in their connexion. But now\r\nyour eyes are open, and I take you!"\r\n\r\n"No you don\'t!" and Mrs. Beale made, with a great fierce jump, a wild\r\nsnatch at her stepdaughter. She caught her by the arm and, completing an\r\ninstinctive movement, whirled her round in a further leap to the door,\r\nwhich had been closed by Sir Claude the instant their voices had risen.\r\nShe fell back against it and, even while denouncing and waving off Mrs.\r\nWix, kept it closed in an incoherence of passion. "You don\'t take her,\r\nbut you bundle yourself: she stays with her own people and she\'s rid of\r\nyou! I never heard anything so monstrous!" Sir Claude had rescued Maisie\r\nand kept hold of her; he held her in front of him, resting his hands\r\nvery lightly on her shoulders and facing the loud adversaries. Mrs.\r\nBeale\'s flush had dropped; she had turned pale with a splendid wrath.\r\nShe kept protesting and dismissing Mrs. Wix; she glued her back to the\r\ndoor to prevent Maisie\'s flight; she drove out Mrs. Wix by the window or\r\nthe chimney. "You\'re a nice one--\'discussing relations\'--with your talk\r\nof our \'connexion\' and your insults! What in the world\'s our connexion\r\nbut the love of the child who\'s our duty and our life and who holds us\r\ntogether as closely as she originally brought us?"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know!" Maisie said with a burst of eagerness. "I did bring\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe strangest of laughs escaped from Sir Claude. "You did bring us--you\r\ndid!" His hands went up and down gently on her shoulders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix so dominated the situation that she had something sharp for\r\nevery one. "There you have it, you see!" she pregnantly remarked to her\r\npupil.\r\n\r\n"WILL you give him up?" Maisie persisted to Mrs. Beale.\r\n\r\n"To YOU, you abominable little horror?" that lady indignantly enquired,\r\n"and to this raving old demon who has filled your dreadful little mind\r\nwith her wickedness? Have you been a hideous little hypocrite all these\r\nyears that I\'ve slaved to make you love me and deludedly believed you\r\ndid?"\r\n\r\n"I love Sir Claude--I love HIM," Maisie replied with an awkward sense\r\nthat she appeared to offer it as something that would do as well. Sir\r\nClaude had continued to pat her, and it was really an answer to his\r\npats.\r\n\r\n"She hates you--she hates you," he observed with the oddest quietness to\r\nMrs. Beale.\r\n\r\nHis quietness made her blaze. "And you back her up in it and give me up\r\nto outrage?"\r\n\r\n"No; I only insist that she\'s free--she\'s free."\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale stared--Mrs. Beale glared. "Free to starve with this pauper\r\nlunatic?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do more for her than YOU ever did!" Mrs. Wix retorted. "I\'ll work\r\nmy fingers to the bone."\r\n\r\nMaisie, with Sir Claude\'s hands still on her shoulders, felt, just as\r\nshe felt the fine surrender in them, that over her head he looked in a\r\ncertain way at Mrs. Wix. "You needn\'t do that," she heard him say. "She\r\nhas means."\r\n\r\n"Means?--Maisie?" Mrs. Beale shrieked. "Means that her vile father has\r\nstolen!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get them back--I\'ll get them back. I\'ll look into it." He smiled\r\nand nodded at Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\nThis had a fearful effect on his other friend. "Haven\'t I looked into\r\nit, I should like to know, and haven\'t I found an abyss? It\'s too\r\ninconceivable--your cruelty to me!" she wildly broke out. She had hot\r\ntears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her very kindly, almost coaxingly. "We\'ll look into it\r\nagain; we\'ll look into it together. It IS an abyss, but he CAN be\r\nmade--or Ida can. Think of the money they\'re getting now!" he laughed.\r\n"It\'s all right, it\'s all right," he continued. "It wouldn\'t do--it\r\nwouldn\'t do. We CAN\'T work her in. It\'s perfectly true--she\'s unique.\r\nWe\'re not good enough--oh no!" and, quite exuberantly, he laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Not good enough, and that beast IS?" Mrs. Beale shouted.\r\n\r\nAt this for a moment there was a hush in the room, and in the midst of\r\nit Sir Claude replied to the question by moving with Maisie to Mrs. Wix.\r\nThe next thing the child knew she was at that lady\'s side with an arm\r\nfirmly grasped. Mrs. Beale still guarded the door. "Let them pass," said\r\nSir Claude at last.\r\n\r\nShe remained there, however; Maisie saw the pair look at each other.\r\nThen she saw Mrs. Beale turn to her. "I\'m your mother now, Maisie. And\r\nhe\'s your father."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just where it is!" sighed Mrs. Wix with an effect of irony\r\npositively detached and philosophic.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale continued to address her young friend, and her effort to be\r\nreasonable and tender was in its way remarkable. "We\'re representative,\r\nyou know, of Mr. Farange and his former wife. This person represents\r\nmere illiterate presumption. We take our stand on the law."\r\n\r\n"Oh the law, the law!" Mrs. Wix superbly jeered. "You had better indeed\r\nlet the law have a look at you!"\r\n\r\n"Let them pass--let them pass!" Sir Claude pressed his friend hard--he\r\npleaded.\r\n\r\nBut she fastened herself still to Maisie. "DO you hate me, dearest?"\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at her with new eyes, but answered as she had answered\r\nbefore. "Will you give him up?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale\'s rejoinder hung fire, but when it came it was noble. "You\r\nshouldn\'t talk to me of such things!" She was shocked, she was\r\nscandalised to tears.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Wix, however, it was her discrimination that was indelicate.\r\n"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" she roundly cried.\r\n\r\nSir Claude made a supreme appeal. "Will you be so good as to allow these\r\nhorrors to terminate?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale fixed her eyes on him, and again Maisie watched them. "You\r\nshould do him justice," Mrs. Wix went on to Mrs. Beale. "We\'ve always\r\nbeen devoted to him, Maisie and I--and he has shown how much he likes\r\nus. He would like to please her; he would like even, I think, to please\r\nme. But he hasn\'t given you up."\r\n\r\nThey stood confronted, the step-parents, still under Maisie\'s\r\nobservation. That observation had never sunk so deep as at this\r\nparticular moment. "Yes, my dear, I haven\'t given you up," Sir Claude\r\nsaid to Mrs. Beale at last, "and if you\'d like me to treat our friends\r\nhere as solemn witnesses I don\'t mind giving you my word for it that I\r\nnever never will. There!" he dauntlessly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t!" Mrs. Wix tragically commented.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale, erect and alive in her defeat, jerked her handsome face\r\nabout. "He can\'t!" she literally mocked.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t, he can\'t, he can\'t!"--Sir Claude\'s gay emphasis wonderfully\r\ncarried it off.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale took it all in, yet she held her ground; on which Maisie\r\naddressed Mrs. Wix. "Shan\'t we lose the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we shall lose the boat," Mrs. Wix remarked to Sir Claude.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale meanwhile faced full at Maisie. "I don\'t know what to make of\r\nyou!" she launched.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said Maisie to Sir Claude.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Maisie," Sir Claude answered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale came away from the door. "Goodbye!" she hurled at Maisie;\r\nthen passed straight across the room and disappeared in the adjoining\r\none.\r\n\r\nSir Claude had reached the other door and opened it. Mrs. Wix was\r\nalready out. On the threshold Maisie paused; she put out her hand to her\r\nstepfather. He took it and held it a moment, and their eyes met as the\r\neyes of those who have done for each other what they can. "Good-bye," he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye." And Maisie followed Mrs. Wix.\r\n\r\nThey caught the steamer, which was just putting off, and, hustled across\r\nthe gulf, found themselves on the deck so breathless and so scared that\r\nthey gave up half the voyage to letting their emotion sink. It sank\r\nslowly and imperfectly; but at last, in mid-channel, surrounded by the\r\nquiet sea, Mrs. Wix had courage to revert. "I didn\'t look back, did\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He wasn\'t there," said Maisie.\r\n\r\n"Not on the balcony?"\r\n\r\nMaisie waited a moment; then "He wasn\'t there" she simply said again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix also was silent a while. "He went to HER," she finally\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n"Oh I know!" the child replied.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wix gave a sidelong look. She still had room for wonder at what\r\nMaisie knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHAT MAISIE KNEW***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 7118-8.txt or 7118-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/7/1/1/7118\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
