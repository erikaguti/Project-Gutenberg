In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\r\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\r\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\r\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\r\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\r\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\r\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\r\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\r\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\r\nwith offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\r\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\r\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\r\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\r\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm\r\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\r\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\r\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\r\nwith any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\r\n(zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\r\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how\r\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\r\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\r\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***FINIS***\r\n'
